Donald Trump? Who cared? He was just The Apprentice then,\u0027  photographer Keith Munyan, one of her close friends, said.Trump has always denied having sex with Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. At the time of their alleged encounter, he had been married to the first lady for a year. Last week, his long serving lawyer flipped on him and admitted paying Daniels $130,000 to keep her allegations to herself ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen admitted making a similar arrangement with former playmate Karen McDougal.   \u0027It was just normal person sex,\u0027 Daniels said of her alleged tryst with the president in 2006. Trump (pictured together at the Lake Tahoe golf tournament were they met) denies they ever slept togetherFor months, Trump said he did not know about the payments. In his plea, Cohen claimed the opposite and said he acted under Trump\u0027s instruction. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in doing so, among other criminal charges, and is now facing jail time. Daniels gloated on Twitter after his plea. She later told Vogue: \u0027Michael and I are vindicated, and we look forward to the apologies from the people who claimed we were wrong.\u0027 Her in-person interview  was completed months earlier when her fight against the president and his lawyer was still uncertain but others interviewed for it said they all knew about the payment and laughed at Daniels for not taking more money.\u0027We made fun of her because she took so little money,\u0027 Kelli Roberts who worked with Daniels in the porn industry, said. Roberts later said Daniels \u0027stood out\u0027 from others when she was in charge of porn shoots in the 1990s because she would \u0027rent mansions for the day\u0027 and \u0027bring bottled water and doughnuts to make the girls feel comfortable.\u0027 Daniel complained that she was living like a \u0027fugitive\u0027 with paparazzi camped outside her home in Texas if she ever stayed put for long enough. \u0027We’ve been in a couple car chases. We’ve had people put notes under the door, which means they know what hotel I’m in, which means we\u0027ve had to change hotels in the middle of the night,\u0027 she said, referring to herself and her lawyer Michael Avenatti.                             My fan base is completely different. It\u0027s pretty much these packs of women and they\u0027re like, You\u0027re going to save the world.                         \u0027We’ve been at restaurants when we order food and it’s taken too long or somebody was watching and we’ve had to leave—like that. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so skinny,\u0027 she went on. Avenatti was also photographed by Leibowitz for the interview. The pair jokingly referred to themselves as Thelma and Louise at one stage.\u0027Do you want to be Thelma or Louise, Michael?\u0027 she asked.  Avenatti replied: \u0027Who\u0027s driving the car?\u0027 Their exchange went on with Daniels asking, \u0027Yeah, who decided to go off the cliff?\u0027 When the Vogue writer interjected that it had been Thelma, Avenatti carried on: \u0027But was she driving?\u0027 After being told that she wasn\u0027t, he said: \u0027I want to be Louise.\u0027 Daniels, at that, said: \u0027Which one of us gets Brad Pitt?\u0027 Elsewhere, Avenatti described her as \u0027really f****** smart\u0027. After Cohen\u0027s plea last week, he told the magazine in an email: \u0027Trump is in a lot of trouble. His habit of disloyalty and stepping on people is about to catch up to him.\u0027 The interview also happened before Daniels was arrested in Ohio during one of her strip shows. She was accused of inappropriately touching patrons by slapping their faces with her bare breasts. Avenatti fought the charges successfully and they were dropped. Since she began her Make America Horny Again tour of strip clubs, Daniels said she has been faced with an unexpected outpouring of admiration from women who are pinning their hopes for a \u0027revolution\u0027 on her, their unlikely leader. \u0027My fan base is completely different. It’s pretty much these packs of women, and they are angry. People come up and they’re so emotional and they put so much on me. They’re like, You’re going to save the world, you’re a patriot, you’re a hero. \u0027When I started this, I just wanted to save my own a**. Not everybody else\u0027s,\u0027 she said.She also touched on her estranged relationship from her mother which had been well documented in previous interviews and said her upbringing was \u0027neglectful\u0027.  \u0027I haven’t talked to my mom in over ten years and I haven’t talked to my dad in 22 years,\u0027 she said, adding that she grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convinced that she had been adopted from a rich family because she felt so out of place with her own relatives.                             She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine                        \u0027My mom lives in a house that has a boat in the front yard that hasn’t seen water since 1982, and she’s content to just sit there and chain-smoke, and I just couldn’t be like that,\u0027 she said. She later said: \u0027I learned all my early life skills from the strippers at that first club I worked.\u0027 After her Ohio arrest, Daniels\u0027 third husband filed for orce and asked for full custody of their seven-year-old daughter. In the Vogue interview, she spoke candidly about her child and how much she knows about her battle with the president. \u0027She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine. \u0027The problem is they keep using the words, porn star, and she doesn’t know what a porn star is, because she doesn’t know what sex is, and I’m not quite ready to have that conversation,\u0027 she said. Her daughter has been with her father over the last several months while she tours the country. The pair have limited contact and Daniels must wait for her to call her because the child gets too upset whenever she gets in touch unexpectedly, she said. \u0027If I contact her, it makes her sad, so I just kind of have to wait until she wants to talk to me,\u0027 she said. She was forced to pull her daughter out of school and hire a private tutor when a man tried to take a photograph of her near campus, she said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/13/4EF50C8C00000578-0-image-m-17_1533818700574.jpg","title":"Sikhs allow Muslim pray temple Malaysia","story":"    Sikhs in Malaysia allowed a Muslim man (pictured in blue shirt) to pray at their gurdwara when he couldn\u0027t find a mosqueMeanwhile, Sikh men are seen sat on a makeshift stage and singing into a microphone.The clip was shared on a Facebook group called SikhInside last week, where it has since been viewed almost 100,000 views.Son of California police chief grins and flips the bird...Parents outraged at middle school assignment asking students...Share this article\u0027A Muslim brother spotted doing Namaz in Gurdwara Sahib Bercham Ipoh,\u0027 the caption added.\u0027Probably he couldn\u0027t find a mosque and drop by Gurdwara to complete his Namaz.

I felt like she could move in a way that was so nonchalant and you could be captivated by her expression.’ Stylander’s cinematic vision has helped her to amass an impeccable body of work during her career, and the images she captured from 1990 to mid-2000s are all part of her wide-ranging collection to be included in her book.‘I really wanted to look and revisit the imagery that I did while I was living in Europe in the Nineties,’ said Stylander, who studied under the legendary photographer Art Kane before she kickstarted her career in the industry.‘I loved the period with the magazines I was working with it was very directed towards photographers’ style and I had a really particular style. \u0027This was the work that I loved so much, it really spoke to me and it just seemed to be around the beginning of the Nineties and to about the 2000s where I thought it would be a good time to revisit and put it out there.’  Stylander’s cinematic vision has helped her to amass an impeccable body of work during her career and the images she captured from 1990 to mid-2000s are all part of her wide-ranging collection to be included in her book.

They will generate a total tax reduction of £185,100.The works will go to the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex, the couple’s local gallery.Dunphy said no organisation was more deserving of the works and he was more confident of the public being able to see them. “We love our connection with Pallant House Gallery and the fact that we can come and see the works when they are on show.“We prefer to give to a smaller gallery than one of the nationals where half of it will never be shown. We’re so happy to make this gift ... really proud.”The six works were all initially bought for display in the couple’s homes, including one in nearby Bognor Regis.The Hirst work, titled Bognor Blue, is from his 2008 butterfly series, which involved him fixing dead butterflies on to monochrome gloss canvases, a riff on how we all paint something and then insects fly in and mess it up. In this case the result is aesthetically pleasing.The Turk work is called Dump, a 2004 limited edition of a what looks no more than a full black bin bag. If anyone were to kick it they might, painfully, discover it was cast in bronze.Some of the works are already on loan at the gallery, including an edition of Emin’s Roman Standard (2005), a small bronze bird perched on top of a 3.5-metre pole and Whiteread’s Untitled (For Frank) (1999), a plaster relief of bookshelves.Simon Martin, director of the gallery, said they were thrilled to receive the gift. “Pallant House Gallery is often described as a collection of collections and this remarkable addition will enable us to present the continuing history of British art from the 20th century to the present day.”Dunphy was Hirst’s business manager from 1995 to 2010, and his acumen helped make Hirst his fortune. About 200 works from Dunphy’s art collection are due to be sold at Sotheby’s on 20 September.The cultural gifts scheme was introduced in 2013, an extension of the acceptance in lieu scheme, allowing people to give in their lifetime. Notable gifts have included an archive of 885 items relating to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a collection amassed by the entrepreneur Clive Richards and given to Bristol’s new Being Brunel museum and a Wright of Derby portrait given to the  in Bath by its former chairman David Posnett."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d0d90cd2cb33eb50bc77d15bcf457f50a89b2b/2111_592_4172_2503/master/4172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac364133cfe68828e7cededde8d85721","title":"oran z collecting black americana hidden history race","story":"From a slave’s collar to segregation signs, Oran Z has spent years collecting often shocking mementoes of America’s racial struggles. Now it all lies in shipping containers – and no institution will touch itOran Z’s house is so crammed with black American memorabilia there is barely room to move. The hallways are lined with glass-fronted display cabinets and plastic storage crates filled with everything from slave shackles to the disembodied wax heads of African-American icons. The shelves groan under the weight of thousands of dolls, vinyl records, Mammy cookie jars and a vast assortment of what he calls “knick-knack paddywhacks” – curios, gadgets and toys, many of them startling in their unabashed racism.The dining table, doing double-duty as desk space for a bank of computers, is hemmed in by a set of outsized, high-backed leather chairs. The kitchen is strewn with every imaginable object except cooking equipment. And outside the house, behind the swimming pool and towards the Sierra Pelona mountains of the Mojave desert, are nine shipping containers filled to the brim with a lifetime’s obsessive accumulation.These days he’s also a man on a mission. Having been diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer, he wants to find a home for his collection while he still has time.A few years ago, Oran had a large exhibition space in LA’s historically African-American Crenshaw district, where he also had a hair salon, dance hall and small radio station, all in a building he owned near the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza shopping mall. His Pan African Black Facts and Wax Museum wasn’t exactly an established stop on the Los Angeles tourist trail, but it was a treasured local curiosity, a disorganised grandmother’s attic of an exhibition with some astonishing items. Walk in and you might have seen a drinking fountain sign from the segregation era in the deep south (whites to the left, “coloreds” to the right), or a large metallic dog tag once worn by a slave at auction, or a piggy bank featuring a stereotypical black beggar, labelled the “Jolly Nigger”. The trick is to put a coin in the man’s outstretched hand, flick a switch and watch the hand dump the coin in the man’s mouth. Oran calls such items a “hidden history”, a testament to America’s deep racism that most museums would be squeamish to display without a lot of explanatory context, if they dared display them at all. Oran thought he’d grow old and die in his Crenshaw location, but then came the 2008 financial meltdown and a buy-out offer from a community redevelopment agency, which saw an opportunity to gentrify the neighbourhood – but is yet to convert the space into a long-promised new shopping centre.Oran decamped to the desert, thinking the move would be temporary, but six years later he is still here. So is all his stuff, even if the wax figures are now relegated to boxes where Oran has put clear plastic goggles over their eyes to stop them popping out. Every day, he contacts museums, the Los Angeles public library, art spaces, schools – anybody he thinks he can convince to view his collection as an educational resource and, potentially, an inspiration to black kids stuck in urban poverty and looking for a way out. In some ways, in all its eccentricity and excess, there is no separating the collection from the man who amassed it.Oran Z is a born storyteller, a man of all-consuming, largely self-taught curiosity. He was born in Omaha, Nebraska, into a family of Jehovah’s Witnesses so protective he wasn’t fully conscious of his race and its meaning until his late teens. At 16, while still at school, he established a printing business. The following year, he took off to California, where he dreamed of becoming a professional drummer. Then he went to Alabama, where his sister was in beauty school. Any illusions he had about doing as he pleased in the heart of Dixie came crashing down when he walked into an ice cream factory and gunfire rang out above his head. (His sister later told him never to go through the front door.) Unable to get a decent job because of the colour of his skin, he bused tables and hustled at pool halls until he had earned enough money “to get the hell out of there”.Years later, Oran got into the hair business back in Omaha. He claims to have invented the bonding adhesive used in hair-weaving and the first hair detangler, only he says to have both ideas stolen from him by hair-care conglomerates. One day, feeling down on his luck, he decided to kick his cigarette habit – he was up to five packs a day – and spend the money on antiques and knick-knacks instead. A history professor he knew at the University of Nebraska asked him to give her a first look at any black memorabilia, and soon he was keeping the items she didn’t want.Oran opened his first exhibition space in Omaha, next to his salon, and as he travelled the world doing hair shows he raided junk stores, thrift shops and antique emporiums. As his children grew older – he had seven of them, six of whom survive – he’d get them to go knick-knack hunting and offer $20 to the one with the best find of the day. In 1997, Oran’s luck soured once more. His second wife filed for orce and he left Omaha for Los Angeles. There, in his misery, he pictured himself as a hermit and a drunk. “I took a spoon, a fork, a gallon of gin and a gallon of vodka,” he said. He found himself living among crack addicts and dealers, until one day he spent his last 38 cents on a bean burrito from Taco Bell and found the fortitude to pull himself together. He got back in touch with his hair-care vendors, rebuilt his business and, in two years, was solvent enough to buy his building and stuff it with ever more memorabilia. He bought from garage sales and from museums. He acquired papers, books, autographs – including two faded letters from the Tuskegee Institute African-American to its headmaster Booker T Washington, the famed orator and opponent of Jim Crow laws in the south.Film crews often set up in the parking lot outside his building, and Oran talked his way into being used as an extra on ER, Seinfeld and a handful of movies, including How Stella Got Her Groove Back. He says it was his hair products and weaving technique that Johnny Depp used in Edward Scissorhands he thought at one point he might go into the movie business full time.But it was his collection that came to define him. “Some of it is bloat,” he freely admits, alluding to the sheer number of dolls, piggy banks, cookie jars, baseball mitts and cereal boxes emblazoned with images of black athletes, “but some of it is one-of-a-kind.”As he works to digitise the collection, a seemingly sisyphean task, and shows off what he has to passing museum curators and other collectors, he is helped by his wife, Betty, who has claimed one corner of the kitchen table as her own, and the 17-year-old grandson who lives with them in the wilds of Antelope Valley. It’s an unlikely place for an African-American family. “Back in the day, you couldn’t be black and live here,” he acknowledges. But he enjoys the quiet, and the poppies that flower in spring, and the regular sightings of coyotes, roadrunners and bobcats.And the clutter? Whatever happens to the collection, it seems unlikely that will ever go away. “What do you do?” says Betty, who knows better than anyone. “You accept the baggage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc8d09477da94502acd7c2bb5634d9b3fbf1c5b/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=29db345f0a4ce0af6cb8aaed73aa64e5 1400w","title":"is social media influencing book cover design","story":"With ‘bookstagramming’ becoming a force in marketing, are designers making covers more colourful, bolder and cleaner, to stand out on our screens?To paraphrase John Waters: “We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody and they don’t have books, don’t sleep with them.” It’s a funny sentiment, but one he may feel has finally been achieved, as books – and their covers – have become something of an accessory.The rules of book cover design change decade by decade. Covers from the 1990s now look colourful and almost too busy (the wardrobe of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air would be a close aesthetic comparison). Tim Kreider, writing for The New Yorker in 2013, identified a lull in book design in the early 2010s that was exemplified, as he saw it, by a crop of white covers with simple lines of text (think Malcolm Gladwell or Haruki Murakami). For a time, it seemed that eBooks and kindles would displace their physical counterparts, but this didn’t quite come to pass. Like the recent revival of zines, the encroach of digital has resulted in a renewed appreciation for the physical – and beautiful. Part of this has been in direct response to eBooks a tactic to boost the sales of physical books is to remake them as desirable objects, and a way to make objects desirable is, of course, to make them aesthetically appealing. But social media – specifically Instagram, which promotes the coveting of beautiful covers on hashtags such as #bookstagram – is putting a new emphasis on cover aesthetics. We no longer need to go home with someone in order to see their bookcase.“With social media, people display their books in more places than their personal libraries at home. They’ve almost become an accessory in some cases,” says Rachel Willey, a designer behind covers including Patricia Lockwood’s Priestdaddy (the title takes the form of a nameplate necklace against a freckled chest) and Melissa Broder’s merman-romance The Pisces (a woman passionately embracing a fish).“If I don’t like the cover, I won’t photograph it and put it on my feed,” says Femke Brull, a “bookstagramer” who runs @booksfemme. While she won’t avoid promoting a loved, if less-attractive book, she opts for a snap of the title page instead – even if it is less memorable than a beautifully covered counterpart. And she will “pay extra” for what she considers a better-looking edition.“I plead guilty to buying multiple copies of a book because I’ve seen an edition floating around that is prettier than my own,” Emily Klump (of @litinquiry) says. I’d do this too I was disappointed when my own copy of Patricia Lockwood’s Priestdaddy arrived, with a cover that wasn’t Willey’s design.Faber and Faber’s recent releases signify a new focus on design the publisher is giving away free letterpress prints of the cover of Sally Rooney’s new book Normal People (an ink illustration of a couple encased inside a tin of sardines) to those who pre-order. For Rachel Cusk’s Faye trilogy, designer Rodrigo Corral used work by the photographer Charlie Engman, whose pictures are often featured in magazines such as Vogue – and accordingly, the Cusk covers are stylish in a way that brings to mind coffee table or art books. Corral says social media directly affects his designs: “Our jacket art often has social media in mind, as we often create animated gifs, profile icons, and moving images that expand on the book jacket art and are designed to spread across the internet.”Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick, originally published in the US in 1997, was published in the UK for the first time in 2015, to a new wave of popularity. This was in no small part due to the zeitgeist catching up with Kraus still, it’s not a leap to say its success could also be credited to a new, memorable cover: I LOVE DICK, emblazoned in big, bold capitals. In her review for the London Review of Books, Jenny Turner likened it to a pop single, in which the “song and band and title and cover all worked together to make what, if you were lucky, would be seen as an instant classic.”Wolfgang Tillmans’ “astro crusto” covers Olivia Laing’s latest book, Crudo: a clean, almost synthetically shiny, cracked crab of a delicate pink, with a fly hinting at decay. Laing has described Crudo as the first book for which she knew exactly what the cover should be (Tillman’s photograph brought to a mind a scene in which protagonist Kathy opens a crab with a hammer). It’s rare for a cover to have such a symbiotic relationship with its book, but that’s not to say that the two should be totally detached. A cover can’t change the contents of its book, but it can be a reader’s first impression of the book’s identity, especially with social media as Willey says: “People now see covers before they get released, before even going to a bookstore.” The evolution of this relationship between platform, design and literature is seen in the New York Public Library’s new “Insta novels” project, which will see the library release animated condensed versions of novels such as Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland as Instagram stories. Even the fashion world has caught on to the idea of the book as accessory: for their 2018 autumnwinter campaign (which featured models reading), Loewe created a box set of literary classics, include Dracula and Don Quixote, with covers by photographer Steven Meisel. If this all makes you despair – that books’ insides are being usurped by their outsides – Loewe’s campaign is also a reminder of the gravitas that books bring. They aren’t just well-designed accessories, they’re items that imply intellect. “Imply” being the key word no matter what Waters said, no one is going to sleep with you unless you get past the cover."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47ff4b289e0db89728f7f73f5c2ac705fbfb3237/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=628f70577880334ee7aae63f3e9f2a1d","title":"aston martin expected to unveil london stock exchange flotation","story":"Luxury carmaker expected to announce plans to sell £1bn worth of shares in IPOAston Martin is expected on Wednesday to announce plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in a deal that could value James Bond’s favourite sports car brand at about £5bn.The luxury carmaker is expected to announce plans to sell about £1bn worth of shares in the initial public offering (IPO), which could take place as soon as October or November.Aston Martin, which was founded in a small London workshop in 1913 and has expanded to become one of the world’s biggest sports car brands, has been debating whether to float its shares in London or New York.Sky News reported on Tuesday that the firm’s Italian and Kuwaiti owners had chosen London. Sources close to the situation confirmed the plans. A company spokesman declined to comment, and described the reports as “continued speculation”.The flotation will be a big test of the appetite of investors to back British companies, as very few large IPOs are expected before the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union in March 2019.Aston Martin’s chief executive, Andy Palmer, has said that Brexit is not a huge concern for the company as it sells relatively few cars into continental Europe and is also used to dealing with tariffs in most of its export markets. However, the company imports about two-thirds of its parts from Europe.The carmaker is hoping to double production to 14,000 vehicles a year as demand from super-rich car enthusiasts increases. The company, which is based in Gaydon in Warwickshire, sold 5,098 cars last year – its highest number in nine years. The fastest growing markets were the US, the UK and China.The company, which suffered a £163m loss in 2016, made a pretax profit of £87m last year on record revenues of £876m.The character of James Bond has driven an Aston Martin intermittently on film since 1964, when he drove a DB5 in Goldfinger. For the following year’s Thunderball, the car was adapted with a water cannon and a boot-stowed jetpack. The DB5 returned in Goldeneye in 1995 and in several Bond films since, including Skyfall and Spectre.The company last week announced plans to create 25 Goldfinger DB5s complete with some of Bond’s gadgets, including revolving number plates. The cars, which will all come in Bond’s silver birch colour, will cost £2.75m each and will not be road legal.The company recently began production of its new Vantage sports car model, which is hand-built in Gaydon. Marking the start of production of the Vantage earlier this year, Greg Clark, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: “Aston Martin is an iconic brand that is an integral part of Britain’s proud automotive heritage.“Through our modern industrial strategy we are building on this success, and the new Vantage is a British-built car exemplifying the skill and innovation that sets the UK auto sector apart from its competitors.”Next to hit the production line will be the DBS Superleggera, a super-GT with a top speed of 211 mph (340kmh) and 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.4 seconds.The company is building a new factory in Wales, where it is expected to base production of its Lagonda Vision emissions-free electric sports car."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c259117df61624bab8c62d32bd1e432e59f95c01/6_0_1908_1145/master/1908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5953652fe864bb4194f0e460a1e4e3c8","title":"how has brexit vote affected uk economy august verdict","story":"Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has on growth, prosperity and tradeFears over a no-deal Brexit sent the pound to the lowest level against the dollar and the euro this year, as Theresa May continued to struggle to gain support for her plan for Britain leaving the EU. Speculation against the pound has intensified over the course of the past month as markets have digested warnings from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and leading Brexit backers arguing the UK would be prepared to walk away from Brussels without a deal.The UK’s trade deficit – how much imports exceed exports – narrowed slightly, despite falling exports of car and aircraft amid weaker manufacturing output in Britain. The trade in goods deficit shrank to £11.4bn in June from £12.5bn in the previous month, beating economists’ forecasts for a deficit of about £12bn. The overall UK trade deficit for goods and services widened by £4.7bn to reach £8.6bn in the three months to June as fears mounted about the impact of Trump’s trade tariffs on Europe and the rest of the world.There were weaker readings for the British economy from closely watched surveys of business activity, pointing towards a surprise fall in output for the UK’s dominant services industry. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply purchasing managers’ index for the sector fell from 55.1 in June to 53.5 last month against expectations for a more modest decline to 54.7. Anything above 50 indicates expansion versus contraction. The PMI for the manufacturing sector also pointed towards slowing growth, while the construction industry continued a recovery after suffering amid heavy snowfall earlier this year.Britain recorded the biggest July budget surplus in 18 years, welcoming news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he considers ways to pay for the promised increase in NHS funding. The ONS reported public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, went into surplus for July by £2bn, comfortably beating City analysts’ forecasts. The latest figures show government borrowing for the financial year so far is around £8.5bn below the same point last year, which could give Hammond more room for manoeuvre at the autumn budget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3b52b33d4d23016feacf868edaa0d51c382994/572_304_2166_1299/master/2166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ba361250a6fae7552a27ef0510a644a","title":"keep carney and carry on for brexit britain","story":"The Bank chief, sweet-talked by the chancellor, will stay until at least the summer of 2019 and may remain even longerMark Carney played hard to get when he was first approached by George Osborne to take over from Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England. When Carney demanded a generous remuneration package, Osborne said yes. When Carney said he would only serve five years at Threadneedle Street rather than the eight specified in the job description, the then chancellor said yes to that as well.Carney has since relented a little on his departure date, pushing it back by a year from the summer of 2018 after being sweet-talked by Philip Hammond into staying on until after Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU next March. Now a rumour has surfaced that Carney has been approached about extending his term until 2020.The Treasury did not exactly pour cold water all over the story, saying merely that it did not recognise the report. That’s probably because Hammond would like to have Carney at the Bank for as long as possible.One small – but not insignificant – reason for that is that if Carney goes as planned next summer Hammond would have to spend scarce Treasury management time this autumn searching for a successor. An advert asking for applications was supposed to go out in July but has yet to appear.But Hammond’s reluctance to see Carney depart next year goes deeper than that. The chancellor thinks the governor is an asset for Britain he likes having Carney next to him at international meetings.The two men also have similar views about Brexit: namely, that there is a danger to the economy from a no-deal outcome. Hammond would find some high-level support useful in what could be bruising cabinet and internal Conservative party battles to come.Last but not least, Carney soothed the financial markets in the choppy days that followed the EU referendum in June 2016, but his impact might well be blunted next spring if he is a lame-duck governor.So, from Hammond’s point of view, it is a no-brainer. The real question is whether Carney wants to do a seven-year stint at the Bank. In turn, that might depend on what his plans are after he leaves Threadneedle Street. Carney was once seen as a future Canadian prime minister or as a possible managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Neither job looks likely to become vacant by next summer and there are not that many Carney-shaped holes out there.Trade is a complex business. Only the initiated really understand tariff schedules, quota arrangements, facilitation agreements and intellectual property rights. That’s why there are really only two types of trade stories: “trade war looms” or “trade war averted”.This week, markets are up because they think the deal struck between the US and Mexico means the threat of protectionism has been rolled back. Donald Trump’s tough negotiating style appears to have paid off. The North American free trade agreement (Nafta) will be re-written in a way that is more favourable to the US. Mexico has already sued for peace. Canada will shortly do the same. Game, set and match to the White House.Well, not quite. For a start, the detail really does matter when it comes to trade deals and the small print of the agreement between the US and Mexico remains sketchy.What’s more, Trump only has authority to conclude a deal with all three original Nafta partners: Congress would need to approve separate US-Mexico and US-Canada trade agreements. That might prove difficult.Finally, Trump has opened three separate trade wars with Nafta, the European Union and China. If the president sees the renegotiation of Nafta as an unalloyed success – as he undoubtedly does – that will encourage him to take a hardline with Brussels and Beijing.Last week’s talks between the US and China did not go well. Meanwhile, the latest set of US trade figures show that the deficit widened from $67.9bn to $72.2bn in July. That’s only to be expected given that Trump’s tax cuts are boosting consumer demand and sucking in imports. But it is likely to harden the president’s stance.Wonga is in serious trouble.

The UN report released this week on the violence against the Rohingya minority found that, while she had no power over the generals it named as responsible, she had “not used her de facto position as head of government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine”.It said that her government – she is state counsellor, akin to prime minister – had contributed to what had happened by denying the generals’ culpability, spreading false narratives and preventing independent investigations.The UN findings – based on the testimony of refugees now in Bangladesh, because its mission was barred from Myanmar – echo the condemnation voiced by many at the time, to the effect that by saying nothing, by not using the admittedly limited room for manoeuvre she had, Aung San Suu Kyi had become complicit with the very generals she had spent so much of her life opposing. It goes so far as to argue that the generals concerned should be investigated for genocide.The UN is due to publish a more detailed report next month. But whatever evidence it produces, it is considered unlikely that Myanmar’s generals will face an international court. Such action would require a UN security council vote, which China would be likely to veto.The judicial process is one thing, however the moral opprobrium that now attaches to Aung San Suu Kyi – revered and idealised for so long, especially in the western world – constitutes a reversal of fortunes that verges on tragedy. There are those, such as the Italian senator and human rights campaigner, Emma Bonino, who argue that she should be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she was awarded while under house arrest in 1991. For others, the damage to her reputation is testimony – and punishment – enough.But there are perhaps two more general points to be made. The first is the black and white way the western world especially tends to treat those it has elevated to heroes. Aung San Suu Kyi – uncompromising, high-minded, yet demure, in her luxuriant garden – is how we used to see her. Now it is as an ethically compromised leader, either too weak or perhaps simply, deep-down, too much of a Burmese nationalist even to try to protect a persecuted minority. There was little recognition at the time she was under house arrest to regard her as anything less than the democratic leader that Myanmar was waiting for.The second is that those who stand up for their cause – to the point of imprisonment, even death – can also be awkward and uncomfortable iniduals. Their single-mindedness, a certain stubbornness, is what can set them apart. Aung San Suu Kyi had a cause, an immense sense of duty, inherited from her Burmese nationalist father, Aung San, who died by an assassin’s hand in 1947. Her sense of responsibility to her nation transcended all else. It led her to return to her homeland – and likely imprisonment – from the safety of her UK exile. When confronted with the choice between nation and family, she chose nation: deciding not to return to her family in the UK, even when her husband became terminally ill.One of the awards she won was the Sakharov prize – named in honour of the Soviet nuclear physicist turned human rights campaigner, who was forced into internal exile and freed only after Mikhail Gorbachev became Soviet leader. In the few years that remained to him, he became something of a thorn in his liberator’s side. Admirable in so many ways, the Soviet-era dissidents could be awkward iniduals who found it hard to fit in – or who saw it as their business not to fit in, and spoke uncomfortable truth to power. Take Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who was repeatedly imprisoned and exiled in his native land, rejected materialism in his US exile, and lived in similar seclusion after returning, in short-lived triumph, to Russia – ever the lone voice in the wilderness.Think too, just now, of John McCain – the admiral’s son shot down in Vietnam who refused to use his privilege to buy his freedom. Returning to the US as an all-American hero, McCain went into business and then into politics, where he may have been that bit too much of a rebel ever to become president. Between the lines of some of the obituaries this week, you will find allusions to the fact that McCain could be stubborn sometimes a difficult man to get along with.Aung San Suu Kyi has disappointed because, in the end, for whatever reason, she appears to have compromised. But she has disappointed also because the pedestal that we – especially in the west – placed her on was just too high. Her sense of mission, her principles and her stubborn streak took her so far, but no further. That is our shortcoming, as much as hers.• Mary Dejevsky is a writer and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68b5b5282bc5d88706dd7340cbf5d8bf010ec771/0_137_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fb7880907da5c1b34923529d0699dd4","title":"ethan hawke superhero films x men logan","story":"It’s always cheering to read an interview with an actor who has reached a stage of their career where they no longer worry about toeing the line. True classics of the genre include barn-busting interviews with Teri Garr (select nuggets: Francis Ford Coppola was “a humourless Italian guy”, Sydney Pollack was “sexist”, Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson “plagiarised” Bruce Conner) Bronson Pinchot (“We thought Tom Cruise was the biggest bore on the face of the Earth”) and most recently, Kathleen Turner (Nicolas Cage “was that asshole”).First off, due credit to Hawke for doubling down and citing two dead European directors, in a move almost calculated to amplify the internet’s frothing tenfold. Of course, for a great number of the famously level-headed people who dwell on the web, there could be no worse an opinion than the belief that a vastly budgeted behemoth about a big buff claw-man might not be a work of art equal to Bresson’s A Man Escaped, a film they have definitely seen. Consequently – which is hilarious, because Hawke probably doesn’t even own a smartphone – the star of the Before trilogy copped a lot of flak on Twitter for his supposedly elitist and highfalutin worldview. For another section of people, including this writer, Hawke’s statement felt like a glass of cold water after a walk through the desert: no working critic would dare voice this perfectly sensible opinion in 2018 for fear of online ridicule, and perhaps because some publications are so keen to keep readers and the studios onside.The fact is that big studio releases are squashing out smaller films. The blockbusters of today are different beasts to those of yore, as Stephen Metcalf notes in an indispensable article for the New Yorker, which shows how superhero franchises have risen to become all-conquering, failure-proof titans at the box office. Metcalf observes that the dearth of quality dramas for grownups in cinemas is being counterbalanced by a rise in ambitious TV dramas, and concludes: “A minimal standard of human relatability is not being met, on a routine basis, in the medium’s most dominant genre. People who are nothing like us rescuing a world that is nothing like ours is not a recipe for artistic renewal.”To me, the sense in this is inarguable. In a world where certain films are wholly critic-proof, how do you assess a superhero juggernaut? Is Avengers 7: The Interminable Revenge of Whatever to be considered relative to superhero films only, or to the whole field of cinema? It goes without saying that certain superhero films are better than others – but it should not be a cause for Siberian banishment to suggest that one, given the well-trodden commercial formulae to which the genre unstintingly adheres, might not ever earn a spot on the Sight \u0026amp Sound Top 50. Why are we so afraid to make a distinction between art and entertainment? The recent creation of a new Oscar for Best Popular Film, which will presumably crown some big CGI hoopla every year, shows that the Academy also has major collywobbles about this question. The answer to the surge in superhero films isn’t to infantilise their fans by claiming that they have any great claims to cinematic artistry, but for our reviewing to step up, and give a strong, coherent, critical assessment of the genre.• Caspar Salmon is a film writer based in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993bab86edbe4d18f5af2d988dd6a3eff437775c/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=038c9502725ce5ec3ef9b4bbc2a7cbdb","title":"palestinian struggle jeremy corbyn zionism","story":"Opposition to Zionism on these grounds is a moral stance, is neither antisemitic nor racist, and is founded on the belief that the creation of Israel has a profound injustice at its roots.Jewish opposition to Zionism has a long and distinguished history. Furthermore, the Palestinian historical narrative has been largely vindicated, in part by Israeli and Jewish historians, and Jewish voices in support of Palestinian rights today abound. Using the charge of anti-Zionism as a tool to silence critics of today’s Israel is the last resort of those seeking to deflect attention away from the egregious path that Israel appears to have chosen. It wants to have it both ways, on the one hand to charge with racism those who conflate anti-Zionism and antisemitism. On the other hand,it accuses those who refuse this conflation, of antisemitism on the grounds that anti-Zionism denies the Jews the right to self-determination. By this token, any criticism of Israel or Zionism becomes a slur on the Jewish people. The insidious goal of the “anti-anti-Zionist” campaign is to silence the Palestinians and their supporters and to smother them with the charge of racism. No one should fall for this or accept it.The question of rooting out antisemitism from Labour or elsewhere is not open to debate. But sympathy for the Palestinians is not antisemitism, and those who stand in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle and its dead have no reason to apologise for doing so. It behoves those who pretend to be offended by such gestures to remember that no side has had a monopoly over virtue in the 100 years of this conflict.They would do well to recall the Jewish terrorist bombings of Arab marketplaces in 1938, the bombing of the King David hotel in 1946, the massacres of Deir Yassin, Illut, Kafr Manda, Saliha, Jish, Safsaf, Hula and other places in 1948, the ethnic cleansing of Lyd and Ramla in 1948, the mass killings in Gaza in 1957, the massacre of Egyptian prisoners in 1956 and 1967, the bombing of an Egyptian children’s school at Bahr el-Baqar in 1970, the shooting down of a Libyan civilian aircraft in 1973, the bombing of Beirut in 1981, the complicity in the Sabra and Shatila massacres of 1982, the killings at Qana in 1996, and the repeated assaults on Gaza since 2005.Be that as it may, it should be clear that the Palestinian case is in no need of any Nazi or any other analogy. It stands soundly on its own moral and political grounds. Those who genuinely sympathise with our cause should understand that evoking the Nazis is not only wrong, but bad politics, as it allows the other side to obfuscate its own crimes while hiding under the mantle of outrage at the very comparison.The Nakba was not a holocaust, and the Israelis are not Nazis. Full stop. But Israel, its armed forces and the pre-state Haganah and Jewish terrorist gangs have all committed heinous crimes, and those who seek to deny or ignore this have no right to be offended by gestures of support for the Palestinian victims of Israel’s continued assaults, or by opposition to Israel’s ideological foundations.The Labour party’s Zionist roots run deep – its intellectuals and party leaders have all been deeply immersed in a Zionistsocialist ethos that has long been bent to defend and serve the Zionist enterprise both pre- and post-state. The party’s 1943 adoption of ethnic cleansing (“let the Arabs be encouraged to move out as the Jews move in”) sent a strong signal to the Jewish leadership as to the boundaries of the possible in Palestine. Today Corbyn stands alone among Labour leaders for his open support of the Palestinian cause. This is a remarkable historical turnabout and one that the Palestinians should be unequivocally grateful for. The trouble is that he has singularly failed to make the case in his own defence. Under a barrage of attacks on the antisemitism issue, he has retreated and backtracked, mumbled and fumbled as if he has something to hide, thereby undermining his credibility as leader and peacemaker alike.Corbyn’s faltering in his own defence is no reason to abandon his principled stance, or for suppressing the debate over Zionism. Indeed, by raising the issue of Zionism and its moral grounding, he has done everyone a favour in spite of himself.• Ahmad Samih Khalidi is a senior associate member of St Antony’s College, Oxford, and co-author of A Framework for a Palestinian National Security Doctrine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f136eecd07e945093e484bc9b87625609be341d9/0_169_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74fa6299f6c386f77df15d6a94c4533e","title":"the guardian view on air pollution its time for politicians to clean up","story":"Two years after the World Health Organization labelled air pollution a global “public health emergency”, and the House of Commons environment committee used the same phrase to describe the situation in the UK, new evidence shows that breathing unsafe air causes a loss of\u0026nbspintelligence, particularly in the over-64s. The research, carried out in China, showed that test scores declined when people breathed toxins including nitrogen dioxide and particulate, with language ability more affected than maths. This news, though alarming, is unlikely to change anything straight away. China has been engaged in a “war against pollution” for five years, while governments and policymakers around the world already have ample evidence that pollution is extremely harmful. Top of the list of dangers is the way it worsens heart and lung diseases including asthma and emphysema, while one study last year suggested a link to dementia.The problem is both global and national: urbanisation and increasing car use mean that pollution is on the rise internationally, while the UK government is under huge pressure to clean up air that has broken EU legal limits for the past eight years. Western capitals do not feature in the WHO’s lists of the planet’s most polluted cities, and levels of most pollutants in the UK have fallen (though not ammonia, a byproduct of farming). But increased scientific understanding of the damage to health caused by gases such as nitrogen oxides makes inexcusable the complacency of which we have seen so much, both under the current Conservative government and its coalition predecessor.London mayor Sadiq Khan’s “ultra low-emission zone”, which comes into force next year and will charge the most polluting vehicles to enter central London, looks set to be a game-changer. Government analysis shows clean air zones to be by far the most effective measure in reducing nitrogen oxides. But critics think it is still too timid, while leaders of other cities are calling for government funding to implement their own clean air zones, as well as a new clean air act to provide a national framework. Campaigners struggle to understand why the public outcry is not loud or angry enough to force the government to act, when air pollution is thought to be a factor in shortening the lives of 40,000 people in the UK every year. So do all those who worry about air pollution, among them parents anxious about the impact on growing lungs. The usual answer is cars, and the fact that even if people would like their cities to be cleaner, they don’t want restrictions on their freedom to drive.It is imperative that we move beyond this stand-off. Recent history shows that when well-evidenced public health measures deliver benefits in improved safety and wellbeing, people accept them with little fuss. The 11-year-old ban on smoking in public places and 35-year-old law making seatbelts compulsory are good examples. While many people are against new rules in principle, trained as they have been by the rightwing press and politicians to be suspicious of the “nanny state”, when it comes to inidual measures – such as manufacturers being obliged to tell them how much sugar is in their food – they are much more receptive.Inidual responsibility has a role to play in all this. Those of us who are able to should think about our choices to drive, walk, cycle, or use a wood-burning stove, just as we should be aware of what we eat and drink. But ministers’ relentless emphasis on personal choice and behaviour in recent years, combined with the arrival of genetic tests and activity trackers such as Fitbits, have occluded those areas of life in which, really, the inidual is not the point. Air quality and the closely related question of urban transport is one of these areas. In July the family of nine-year-old Londoner Ella Kissi-Debrah applied to reopen an inquest into her death, with expert evidence that air pollution may have caused the asthma attack that killed her. Such tragic cases illuminate the extent to which already vulnerable people are the victims of the current inaction. Politicians at all levels must stop ducking and ing and take the measures that are necessary to protect the public’s health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03644e2cc074f3862fbbb68c80a76107fd1d4724/0_0_650_397/master/650.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=168ecb62321eaae1d19a77438b280e0e 1880w","title":"wherefore art thou exhibition celebrates shakespeares shoreditch origins","story":"Foundations of and discoveries from the Theatre, where he honed his craft, to go on displayA permanent exhibition is to be created in Shoreditch on the site of the London theatre where William Shakespeare perfected his trade as a playwright and actor.The Theatre, which opened in 1576 in what was then the rowdy outskirts of London, staged plays including Romeo and Juliet and was one of the first purpose-built theatres in EnglandA display revealing the foundations of the Theatre will open at the site on New Inn Broadway next year. Discoveries made at the site include a unique mug with the image of smart bearded gentleman – clearly one of the wealthy customers for the expensive gallery seats rather than the unruly groundlings – and pottery money boxes which kept the box office receipts safe because they had to be broken to be accessed. There will also be items on loan from museums illustrating the history of London’s earliest theatre district.The Theatre, which opened when Shakespeare was still a schoolboy in Stratford-upon-Avon, was built for £700 by James Burbage with money from his brother-in-law – the partnership, like most of those involving the Burbage family, ended in acrimony.. It was described by the Tudor antiquarian John Stow as a house for “comeddies, tragedies and histories for recreation”. It was built outside the city walls on the site of an old priory, and though most of the site was destroyed by later development, the yard where the groundlings paid pennies to stand, drink, smoke and eat cherries and nuts – the remains of which have all been found on the site – remained as open ground under centuries of back gardens, though the exact location was lost. Shakespeare was with the Theatre by the time of one of the most famous escapades in stage history when Burbage’s company, then run by his son, Richard, fell out with its landlord. They covertly demolished the Theatre and carried the timbers across the Thames to the even more rackety Bankside where the salvaged wood was used to build the much more famous Globe.The Shoreditch site was rediscovered in 2008 by archaeologists from the Museum of London working on a development. The modest remains of the brick and stone polygonal footings of the galleries allowed the shape of the Theatre to be mapped accurately for the first time, while seeds and fruit pips, nut shells and broken beer flagons gave a vivid picture of its everyday activities, in a rollicking area where court records show that brawls from nearby taverns and brothels frequently spread into the theatre itself.Archaeologists are now gathering up the last fragments from the site, which has become Hackney’s first scheduled ancient monument. There is already street art evoking the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, and there will be a statue of Shakespeare commissioned from Raphael Maklouf and Hayley Gibbs.Theatre historian Julian Bowsher has demolished the cherished legend that the Theatre was demolished overnight at Christmas 1598, and the timbers spirited away and slid across the frozen Thames, so that the outraged landlord arrived back to find the a hole in the ground and the missing theatre rebuilt on Bankside.It would have taken much longer to dismantle the building, Bowsher says, and the Globe was much larger, not just a recreation of the Theatre. However, since building materials were very expensive, its timbers did indeed cross the Thames, and were recycled into the most renowned of all the Tudor theatres, which opened in 1599 and where Shakespeare would become one of the most famous playwrights in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e383977fe4db06371070d076a91ee5da5269ad58/0_135_6811_4087/master/6811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8c3da883dea8cb3be344d9ac167549","title":"too dirty to breathe can london clean up its toxic air","story":"Air pollution leaves many Londoners like Catherine Bazell housebound, and as the severe impacts on health become clearer the call for greater action is risingCatherine Bazell looks out from her first floor flat towards the familiar landmarks of central London as a steady stream of cars and vans trundle by on the road below.“Me and my mum and dad used to love taking bus trips for the day when I was a girl,” says the 73-year-old. “We would get a bus and just go off exploring different bits of the city.”Bazell pauses for a moment before adding: “I wish I could do that now with my granddaughter but there’s no way, the pollution is just too bad.”Bazell was born in London during the second world war and suffers from the debilitating lung condition bronchiectasis as well as asthma, leaving her all but housebound during the worst bouts of air pollution.Bazell is one of hundreds of thousands of people whose lives are blighted by the UK’s air pollution crisis. Officials say at least 40,000 people die prematurely in the UK – 9,000 in London – with many more suffering long-term health problems.A spate of recent reports have underlined the scale of the crisis asthma deaths are up hospital admissions spike when air pollution worsens children living in polluted areas are likely to grow up with smaller lungs and risk of lifelong health problems. And it is not just people’s lungs that are at risk – toxic air is increasingly linked to a range of deadly conditions including heart disease, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.“Almost every week we are seeing more evidence of the damage air pollution is doing to the nation’s health,” said Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation . “It’s simply unacceptable that people in towns and cities across the country – particularly the young, the elderly and those with existing lung conditions – are being given no choice but to breathe dangerously dirty air in 2018.”The government claims to be tackling the issue but many experts say it has repeatedly failed to take meaningful action. Ministers have refused calls for a new Clean Air Act and the government has been dragged through the courts over its record – and repeatedly been told by judges that its plans are so poor they are illegal.However, some cities are starting to face up to the challenge. In Manchester the mayor, Andy Burnham, has said air pollution is one of his priorities and earlier this year he unveiled a far-reaching programme to encourage cycling. A host of other cities – including Birmingham, Leeds, Derby, Nottingham and Southampton – are working on proposals for clean air zones following the government’s latest court defeat.But the most ambitious scheme is in London, where the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is planning an “ultra low emissions zone” (Ulez). The proposal will see the most polluting vehicles charged extra for entering the centre of the capital from April next year. In 2021 the zone will be extended to include all the roads within the North and South Circular, which officials predict will affect 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries each day.The scheme has been broadly welcomed by environmental groups and clean air campaigners. However many say the restrictions should be tougher, since the limit on diesel vehicles will still allow some of the worst polluting cars and vans on the road. And many believe the scheme should cover a wider area and be brought in sooner.Caroline Russell, who sits on the London assembly for the Green party, said Khan’s plans were “thorough and comprehensive” but she urged him to go further, quicker and “be braver.”Russell, who chairs the environment committee on the assembly, says there is no reason the expanded zone should stop at the North and South circular, arguing it should stretch to include London’s outer boroughs up to the M25. And she said the new system should be based on a road pricing scheme, allowing vehicles to be charged differing amounts depending, not just on emissions, but also on which roads they are using at what time of day.“We have a real chance to do something that will transform this city – to leave behind our old-fashioned reliance on fossil fuel, private vehicle-based transport in favour of a modern forward-looking system based around efficient, accessible public transport, walking and cycling.” The expanded Ulez area will be enforced using number plate recognition cameras that will automatically charge cars that flout the emissions limits a daily rate – a similar system to the existing congestion charge zone. As well as monitoring NO2 pollution it will also include a “particulate matter standard”, after the  revealed every part of London exceeds World Health Organization air quality guidelines for PM2.5 – the most dangerous particulate.And the plans have even got the backing of many of the major motoring groups . The RAC said it “could not fault the mayor’s crusade to tackle air pollution”. Private hire firms Addison Lee and Uber both welcome the move.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, says his members would be happy to be included in Ulez as long as private hire firms such as Uber are only allowed to buy electric vehicles too.“All we want is a level playing field … we really don’t want to be driving round in these dirty vehicles, we just need a fair deal to get out of them.”Despite the widespread support for Khan’s plans, some residents are sceptical of the mayor’s commitment to cleaning up London’s air. They point to the Silvertown tunnel development – a new crossing under the Thames in east London – which was given the go-ahead this year.Local resident Darryl Chamberlain said Khan’s support for such a big road-building programme made a mockery of his claims to be serious about tackling pollution.Many want the mayor to go further, faster, but most argue that after the inaction of his predecessor, Boris Johnson, London is at last heading in the right direction.Back at her flat, Bazell says that if the pollution today was as visible as it was when she was a girl people would be up in arms.And she says that although she tries to live an active life, her world is increasingly shaped – and restricted – by the poisonous air she breathes.Looking out to the distant London landmarks, she says: “I rarely go into central London any more. There are a few buses or trains I can get to visit family if the pollution is not too bad, but it is not that easy.”Bazell says that a few weeks ago she had to miss her choir session at the local hospital because the pollution was so severe.She looks up with a smile. “It comes to something when the air is too dirty to sing!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b60a02d963c86d119923be00cec03bed0823657a/0_185_4774_2864/master/4774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b4f8efe2ab91104b371476a34a9eb2c","title":"like nicotine bees develop preference for pesticides study shows","story":"Insects’ acquired taste for pesticide-laced food is similar to nicotine addiction in smokers, say scientistsBumblebees acquire a taste for pesticide-laced food that can be compared to nicotine addiction in smokers, say scientists. The more of the nicotine-like chemicals they consume, the more they appear to want, a study has shown. The findings suggest that the risk of potentially harmful pesticide-contaminated nectar entering bee colonies is higher than was previously thought. In a series of studies, a team of British researchers offered bumblebees a choice of two sugar solutions, one of which was laced with neonicotinoid pesticides. They found that over time the bees increasingly preferred feeders containing the pesticide-flavoured sugar. Dr Richard Gill, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London, said: “Given a choice, naive bees appear to avoid neonicotinoid-treated food. However, as inidual bees increasingly experience the treated food they develop a preference for it. “Interestingly, neonicotinoids target nerve receptors in insects that are similar to receptors targeted by nicotine in mammals. “Our findings that bumblebees acquire a taste for neonicotinoids ticks certain symptoms of addictive behaviour, which is intriguing given the addictive properties of nicotine on humans, although more research is needed to determine this in bees.” Controversial neonicotinoid pesticides are chemically similar to nicotine, the addictive compound in tobacco. In 2013 the European Union imposed a partial ban on three widely used neonicotinoids because of evidence that they may be harmful to bees. The ban has now been extended to cover all crops not grown in greenhouses, despite strong opposition from some groups including the UK’s National Farmers’ Union. Scientists carrying out the new research tracked 10 bumblebee colonies over 10 days. Each colony had access to its own foraging area in which the researchers had set up sugar-dispensing feeders. Lead scientist Dr Andres Arce, also from Imperial’s Department of Life Sciences, said: “Many studies on neonicotinoids feed bees exclusively with pesticide-laden food, but in reality, wild bees have a choice of where to feed. We wanted to know if the bees could detect the pesticides and eventually learn to avoid them by feeding on the uncontaminated food we were offering. “Whilst at first it appeared that the bees did avoid the food containing the pesticide, we found that over time the bumblebees increased their visits to pesticide-laden food. “We now need to conduct further studies to try and understand the mechanism behind why they acquire this preference.” The findings are reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Dr Gill added: “Whilst neonicotinoids are controversial, if the effects of replacements on non-target insects are not understood, then I believe it is sensible that we take advantage of current knowledge and further studies to provide guidance for using neonicotinoids more responsibly, rather than necessarily an outright ban.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20ea1d73dde7103963b3cd5183b65069fe834966/1_0_5330_3200/master/5330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea5a6a03c331c183f4b29de6f5d34857","title":"from neon to feasible sleeves how to wear autumns newest trends","story":"We answer all your forward-planning fashion questions, from head to toe, so you can switch seasons like a proAnyone still floating around with a straw basket and sandals may want to take note of the date. With September fast approaching, now is the time to forward-plan your wardrobe – or at least make the transition from clothes for ice-creams and picnics to ones for walks in woods and drinking red wine. Looking at autumn previews in magazines everywhere, you may already have started making the seasonal switchover. We certainly have. Here are seven questions – and answers – to help you switch seasons like a pro.Introducing the statement skirt. You may have one of these in your wardrobe already, but I bet it’s a bit jazz hands – fit and flare, or sequinned, maybe – compared with the wrap skirt. It has a very now, lackadaisical take on style. Already worn by Selena Gomez and Rihanna, I predict this will be a uniform for fashion editors at the shows this September – Gap does a great mid-length version. The slip skirt trend, kickstarted by the long-sold-out Realisation Par leopard-print one, hasn’t reached its peak on the high street yet but set a Google alert now. An item that looks great with a shirt and trainers or a jumper and boots is worth waiting for.Proper cowboy boots were a big thing on the catwalk – but the high street has helpfully realised that no one really wants to be Clint Eastwood on their daily commute. This autumn, go for the demi-cowboy, which hit just above your ankle bone and come with a chunky heel. Good for walking all day, good with jeans, I like this white pair currently on sale at Office. Also acceptable are knee-high boots, but not the kind everyone wore for going out-out circa 1998. These are either cone-heeled and slouched or wide on the leg, for Lauren Hutton vibes.Extreme sleeves – the kind that prevent you eating soup – are on their way out. But sleeves are still a thing. Autumn brings a slightly more sensible option: the long-sleeved shirt dress – Zara does one that manages to be both whimsical and edgy. Rather than the typical SFW examples, sleeves this season have a little bit of romance about them. See versions gathered at the wrist like a folky blouse, or scarf print on an oversized cuff. The new sleeve is wearable, a bit interesting and has little to no impact on your eating options – a trend we can get behind.For anyone wedded to the fashionable yet understated power of navy, there is good news and bad news. Brown – which had a rep for drabness in fashion – is on the rise. This is partly due to fashion’s enduring crush on all things 70s. Brown clothes in 2018 are often also cord, an Insta-friendly way directly to the decade that taste forgot. Find yours at Monki and New Look. And the good news? Brown actually looks great teamed with navy. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Now, women’s fashion thankfully has other, more sensible, demandsIs the thong as underwear reaching the end of its natural life? Granny knickers are in the ascendant, associated by the young not with the existential insideoutside crisis of Bridget Jones, but rather the sexy-in-themselves image of the Kardashian-Jenner sisters and their big Calvin Klein pants in an advertising campaign last January the regular brief has made a comeback.Sales of the G-string, meanwhile, have been down since 2016, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, pant-vendor to all right-thinking people, reporting only one in 10 sales being a thong. In record time, the thong has become a\u0026nbspniche, retro sign, which means the only point of wearing it is if people can see that you are. See the parade of thong swimwear on this year’s Love Island, where the mantra is very much: if you’ve got it, flaunt it. This is the very opposite of what the thong was supposed to be all\u0026nbspabout.A constant fixation of 80s and 90s girls’ literature (Bliss, Just 17) was the VPL (visible panty line). Over time, there evolved gradations within that, such as: which particular bit of the panty’s line could be seen? M\u0026ampS used to have gigantic stickers on its undies saying, “side-seam free”, the way you might promote eggs that weren’t battery\u0026nbspfarmed. The answer to this self-imposed VPL shame was a\u0026nbspthong\u0026nbsp– there was nothing to see because there wasn’t anything there. Which then led to all kinds of questions, such as: “Why wear underwear at\u0026nbspall?”The more modest or self-conscious teens (ie, all of them) hated thongs, while feeling under the most intense pressure to wear them. The evolution to the full pant is partly driven by tech\u0026nbsp– materials are now so flexible that you can’t see anything under anything else and the top-end has been comprehensively knocked off (Hanky Pankys, which the Wall Street Journal described, a\u0026nbspbit ickily, as “like lace butter” in 2004, now have a\u0026nbspperfectly serviceable Primark equivalent). You are much more likely to get a\u0026nbspvisibility issue from your thong poking over the top of your jeans in that unmistakeable whale tail than you are to see a\u0026nbspside-seam.Steadily, too, the urgent necessity of wearing jeans so tight you can count your change through them has given way to the high-waist, the boyfriend cut, a\u0026nbspraft of trouser that could be loosely grouped under the philosophy of “the point of clothes isn’t necessarily to prove how thin you\u0026nbspare”. This is part of a\u0026nbspgreater curve, away from hiding everything, shaving everything and de-smelling everything, towards having a\u0026nbspshape in three dimensions, pit hair and a\u0026nbsplusty, vivid, unabashed inhabitance of the world.

Campaigners say dozens of local parties have passed motions urging the leadership to back a vote on the final deal.In an email sent to GMB members, the general secretary, Tim Roache, wrote: “GMB wants to hear from members about your views on Brexit, and whether you think there should be a public vote when we know what the deal looks like.”Labour MPs keen for their party to endorse a second referendum hope union leaders, who will meet at the TUC’s annual congress in Manchester, will send a message to the party leadership calling for voters be given the chance to reverse Brexit.Separately, the grassroots pro-Corbyn movement, Momentum, is expected to ballot its members on Brexit in the coming weeks.Mike Buckley, the director of Labour for a People’s Vote, which is organising constituency parties to send motions to the Labour conference, said: “As we approach conference, there’s clearly increasing pressure from the left of the party for a shift in the leadership position.”Buckley’s group is urging constituency Labour parties to pass a motion calling for an immediate general election if parliament rejects the deal, and for that election to be fought on a manifesto that promises a second referendum, with remaining in the EU as an option.It adds that Labour policy should be: “If we cannot get an election, campaign for a public vote and call for an election following a government defeat in that vote.”Unite, whose general secretary, Len McCluskey, is a strong backer of the leadership, passed a motion at its policy conference last month supporting the “possibility” of a “popular vote” on Brexit.Several of the smaller unions, including the Royal College of Nursing and the steelworkers’ union, Community, have come out in support of a fresh referendum.As negotiations between the government and the EU27 on an exit deal enter their final phase, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has insisted the option of a referendum must be kept on the table if the deal is rejected by MPs.However, the shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, last week suggested a second referendum could spark social unrest, saying: “If people feel that the route to change is no longer a democratic route, then you look to social disruption, perhaps civil disobedience, in a different way.”Which motions reach the floor of Labour conference is determined through an arcane process by the conference arrangements committee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11a544bbe8b7f99b8f8c068bd0e49ba8825b2c96/0_525_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f850a20c9c02cd0ac95e722a9aff8360","title":"theresa may pledges galileo alternative if uk locked out of satnav system","story":"PM seeks to raise pressure on EU with pledge of £92m for ‘sovereign’ navigation systemBritain cannot afford to be excluded from core development of the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system and will have to develop its own expensive “sovereign system” if the 27-country bloc does not change its mind, according to Theresa May.The prime minister sought to up the ante by pledging to spend £92m on the initial scoping work for an alternative, unless Brussels allows the UK to be involved in security discussions and contract negotiations during the system’s creation.May said that the UK wants to remain involved in Galileo after Brexit, but said it was not acceptable to “be an ‘end user’, shut out from security discussions and contracts, and without critical information about the systems security”.Galileo is a European satellite navigation system, developed as a rival to the US GPS system. It is due to be launched in 2020 with civilian and military variants, and requires 24 satellites in orbit to be operational.The UK has already contributed £1.2bn to the creation of Galileo but the EU has begun to exclude Britain from the security aspects of its development, triggering a row. Britain had intended its military to use the technology in tandem with GPS.Developing a fully fledged British Global Navigation Satellite System would almost certainly cost several billion pounds, but May is hoping her brinkmanship will persuade the EU to relent. She said: “So unless we receive assurance that we can collaborate on a close basis in the future – like the close security partners we aspire to be – we are clear that we will withdraw UK support for Galileo and pursue our own sovereign satellite system. And this is not an idle threat to achieve our negotiating objectives.”May’s threats were accompanied by a government statement that said sustained disruption to satellite navigation would cost the UK economy £1bn a day because GPS is so widely used in cars and other transportation.Officials said that notional cost to the economy would only apply if all satellite navigations systems were to fail or made unavailable in the UK – an unlikely scenario used as one of several justifications for commencing the scoping study.The money will come from £3bn set aside by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to prepare for Brexit contingencies and will fund an 18-month feasibility study to develop a system that would be compatible with GPS.“This will ensure the UK’s safety post-Brexit, using the expertise of our world-leading space and security sectors to do so,” May said. “Today’s investment marks an exciting time for the sector, and for the UK, and I can’t wait to see what we can achieve.”Ministers have previously suggested that the UK will try to claw back the money it has already contributed to Galileo, although there was no reference to any legal threats in the latest announcement – a clear indication that Britain would prefer to resolve the dispute amicably."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8f92e0d3b9121679b3a40e3b3e45be239aefb7/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea5ecde7b8f75171e310581bd4e6d59","title":"low income tenants face heat eat or pay rent choices study","story":"Housing benefit freeze leaving poorest private renters with shortfall of up to £140 a weekLow-income tenants in the private rented sector face a “heat, eat or pay rent” problem because housing benefit rates have failed to keep up with the soaring cost of accommodation, a study has found.The four-year freeze on local housing allowance levels, which has been in place since April 2016, means some families must meet a shortfall of hundreds of pounds a month on their rent support, according to the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH).It said the ongoing housing benefit freeze meant even the lowest private rents were out of reach for many low-income families in most areas – making it more likely that tenants would be forced to choose between living necessities or paying the rent.“Our research makes it clear just how far housing benefit for private renters has failed to keep pace with even the cheapest private rents. We fear this policy is putting thousands of private renters on low incomes at risk of poverty and homelessness,” said the CIH’s chief executive, Terrie Alafat.The biggest “rent gaps” – the difference between rent and housing support levels in the cheapest third of rented properties in a local housing market area – were in London, where the median shortfall was £66 a week for a four-bedroom property and £43 for a two-bedroom, although this masked larger gaps of more than £140 a week in the inner city – adding up to more than £600 a month.The problem was noticeable in locations near the capital that have been popular with commuters, such as Cambridge, Milton Keynes and Chelmsford, where the weekly shortfalls on a four-bed property were £68, £62 and £59 respectively.There were striking shortfalls in areas such as Greater Glasgow (£82 a week on a four-bedroom home), Bristol (£71) and southern Greater Manchester (£53). The median national weekly rent gap on a four-bedroom home was £17. In a handful of areas, including Liverpool and Leeds, there was no rent gap for this size of property.The weekly shortfall on two-bedroom private rented homes has followed a broadly similar pattern – highest in London, with significant gaps in places such as Bristol (£40), south-west Hertfordshire (£39) and Bath (£34). The median national weekly rent gap on this size of property was £8, according to the research.The CIH said that although ministers introduced a “targeted affordability fund” in 2014 to bridge the biggest gaps, the impact of this had been negligible because it had failed to meaningfully shrink the shortfall in the worst-hit areas.The CIH called on the government to end the freeze on benefits. It estimated that the cost of realigning local housing allowance – which has lagged behind rent increases in many areas since 2013 – would be £1.2bn.Matt Downie, the director of policy at the housing charity Crisis, said: “This report highlights just how much housing benefits for private renters are falling short of the levels needed, leaving many homeless people stuck in a desperate situation and putting yet more people at risk of homelessness.”A government spokesperson said: “We spend £24bn a year on housing benefit each year. And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.“Since 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in discretionary housing payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/391d6e595c6f341c6163f33415589648fd6b62fd/0_803_2136_1281/master/2136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b762603d2bd9c7681463e0443a60b2c7","title":"quarter of 14 year old girls in uk have self harmed report finds","story":"Children’s Society analysis suggests tens of thousands hurting themselves on purposeMore than 100,000 children aged 14 in the UK are self-harming, with one in four girls of this age having deliberately hurt themselves, according to a new report.In figures that show the scale of the mental health crisis affecting young people, the Children’s Survey analysed a survey of 11,000 14-year-olds which found that a quarter of girls and nearly one in 10 boys had self-harmed in a year.The charity estimated that 110,000 children aged 14 may be self-harming, including 76,000 girls and 33,000 boys.Experts have put the behaviour down to a combination of pressure from school, austerity and gender expectations.“It is deeply worrying that so many children are unhappy to the extent that they are self-harming. Worries about how they look are a big issue, especially for girls,” said Matthew Reed, the chief executive of the Children’s Society.The charity analysed figures from the millennium cohort survey, carried out by researchers from University College London, which follows children born in the UK in 2000-01.The report also included a survey of children aged 10-17 and their parents across 2,000 households, which found that the issues of most concern to children were school and their appearance.The mental health campaigner Natasha Devon, who works with young people in schools, said that while the self-harm figures were upsetting they were not surprising.“Self-harm at its root is a coping mechanism like having a glass of wine or smoking a cigarette … these are all self-harming activities … most people say they started doing it as it felt good,” she said. “They did it in response to not feeling heard or not being able to articulate what was wrong. Over time it is addictive.”Devon put some of the blame on austerity.“The world is just a more difficult place to navigate,” she said. “You can see a sharp rise in mental health conditions such as anxiety and self-harm since 2010 and that is when austerity began.” The number of girls under the age of 18 being treated in hospital in England after self-harming has nearly doubled compared with 20 years ago, NHS figures show. There were 13,463 cases last year, compared with 7,327 in 1997. In contrast, the number of admissions for boys who self-harmed rose from 2,236 in 1997 to 2,332 in 2017.Devon said that more needed to be done to treat the causes of self-harm. “We need to look at the environment young people exist in at home and in school so these issues don’t arise in the first place rather than fire-fighting once they have manifested.”The Children’s Society report suggested that both boys and girls can be harmed by gender stereotypes and the pressure to live up to them. Children said they felt under pressure from friends to be good-looking, but those who felt boys should be tough and girls should have nice clothes were least happy with life.Reed said: “Issues like appearance, gender stereotypes and sexuality should be included in the new relationships and sex education curriculum.“However, early support for vulnerable children and families in the community, which can help prevent mental health problems from developing, is also vital, and ministers must urgently address the £2bn funding shortfall facing council children’s services departments by 2020.”Luciana Berger, the MP who is president of Labour Campaign for Mental Health, said: “These shocking statistics on self-harming among children show the extent of the mental health crisis in our country. Children in Britain urgently need more mental health support but the children and young people’s mental health green paper lacked the ambition needed to solve this crisis. The government’s continued disregard for early intervention and prevention is failing a generation.”“I started self-harming when I was 13. I don’t really know why I started doing it. I guess I had a lot going on and wanted to feel in control of something. The first time I did it I was in the bath and I accidentally cut myself shaving. At first I was panicking but then it felt kind of nice so I started doing it on purpose with various different objects. I would do it all the time, it became addictive.“I would feel euphoric afterwards. I found physical pain easier to control than what was going on in my mind. The moments I felt pain were the moments my thoughts stopped and all I focused on was the physical discomfort.“I thought I was the only one doing it, but my friends were too. It came up in conversation and I tried to help them. I encouraged them to seek help, although I never told them I was also doing the same. As well as cutting myself I also developed issues with food. I think both things stemmed from all the pressure I was feeling. Girls feel pressure from a younger and younger age these days. We feel pressure to be perfect and when they don’t achieve that they punish themselves.“I am not sure why girls are more prone to this, perhaps it is because there is more pressure on us to look a certain way. You tend to see more female models, and girls strive to be like them. The gender stereotype is that boys are manly and girls have to be pretty. This leads to people feeling self-conscious and like they need to look and act a certain way. It makes you feel like you cannot be yourself. I saw a girl this weekend and she was so young but plastered in makeup and fake tan and acrylic nails. She was way too young to feel that pressure.“The solution is better education about mental health, so people know where to go if they are struggling. There needs to be more resources. I am getting better now and on the road back to recovery but it’s been a long journey. The most important part of getting better for me was knowing I am not alone and others have experienced this.”Jessica, 18, from south Wales"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/791e7ab82d1ed455c8609dbd97e03ee1588d46ca/352_104_4161_2496/master/4161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8995e85175383cfbc771cd44d83fdb67","title":"bristol premiership pat lam charles piutau big spending","story":"At this time of year the action on the field cannot begin quickly enough. The word is that the coming season will be slicker, shinier and in higher definition than the last – more vibrant, more exciting, more competitive than ever – new sponsors, same spiel but, as Pat Lam prepares to begin his Premiership coaching career with Bristol against Bath on Friday, words that had once\u0026nbsplost all meaning tend to resonate again.As a player Lam made his name as a swashbuckling No 8 and was part of the Western Samoa side that stunned Wales at the 1991 World Cup. Six years later he made the move to Newcastle, with whom he won the Premiership in his first season and in 2000 he was integral to the Northampton team that won the Heineken Cup. So was it always a dream to coach in England? “My dream was to be a schoolteacher,” he says. “I have a real passion for trying to make a difference. I really enjoyed school teaching. Rugby was what I did on the side until it went professional but my passion for teaching never died.”The path from schoolteacher to rugby coach is well-trodden but it does not take long in Lam’s company to see how much his previous calling has influenced his current career. He makes no apology for Bristol’s big-spending – by bringing Charles Piutau in for a reported £1m a year “we’ve done the Premiership a favour” – but the 49-year-old is under no illusions as to where the buck stops. “All I need from players is coachability but what I need from my staff is to make sure that these guys can improve and step up. If they can do that, then I can sit back as a conductor and say: ‘Let’s do that’ or ‘Can we do that?’ I don’t want to say: ‘We can’t do that because the players aren’t good enough to do that.’ If they can’t and they are coachable then it comes back to the coaches.”Lam cut his coaching teeth in his home town of Auckland before an acrimonious departure from the Blues took him to Connacht in 2013. His time at the Sportsground – taking the province, until then the poor relation to Leinster, Munster and Ulster, to the 2016 Pro12 title – had Lam in the frame to be Joe Schmidt’s successor for Ireland until Bristol intervened. Joining a club in England’s second tier at the start of last season led to some accusations that his bumper pay packet was a driving force behind the move but Lam, who took Bristol to the Championship title with 21 wins from 22 matches, is keen to put the record straight.Clarity of thought is one of Lam’s key messages but that is not to be conflated with an authoritarian streak. If anyone needed reminding of his Midas touch, it came at Twickenham in May when Lam’s Barbarians blazed a trail of destruction against England after just three training sessions together, all the while maintaining the invitational side’s off-field traditions. Then it was a 70s night out, in pre-season with “Bristol an Island” theme complete with hula skirts, and it is clear Lam does not always do things by the book."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8acdc2338be6a78e3bb9bf91a38d579fb540ef85/0_2_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c00d19ca2e92bd860704bd40a4745380","title":"leading female jockey horse racing bryony frost back race riding next month injury","story":"• Rider suffered fractured sternum and arterial aneurysm in fall• Paul Nicholls also hoping for imminent return of Harry CobdenBryony Frost is expected to return to race-riding in the next two to three weeks, sources close to the popular jockey have confirmed. The news will be widely welcomed, as Frost declined to put a timescale on her comeback when she last spoke publicly about the range of injuries she suffered last month when a horse trod on her stomach, including a fractured sternum and an arterial aneurysm as well as damage to her liver and pancreas.Frost has been working hard on her rehabilitation during recent days, basing herself at the Injured Jockeys Fund’s Oaksey House in Lambourn. Reports of her progress have encouraged the trainer Paul Nicholls, who is also hoping for an imminent return from anoth er of his principal jockeys, Harry Cobden, the victim of a neck injury in early June.“Harry is going the right way,” Nicholls said. “He’s doing lots of exercise, lots of physio and he has a scan next week, hopes to be riding out soon with a view to riding from 1 October. I think Bryony might be riding even before then but I don’t know for sure. I told the both of them, first of October’s fine.“No one’s more enthusiastic than Bryony. She’s in too much of a hurry. It’s trying to tell her just to hang on, it’s the summer, you need to be riding Black Cortons and that when they come back in October. You don’t want to be riding too much just now. She’s too keen in a lot of ways but that’s not a bad thing.”Nicholls does not expect to wrest the champion trainer’s title back from Nicky Henderson but spoke enthusiastically about his team before his annual owners’ day this weekend. “We’ve got a lot of really nice novice chasers like Topofthegame, Master Tommytucker, Movewiththetimes, Mont Des Avaloirs, Captain Cattistock, you can go on and on. Some really nice horses that are sort of below the radar, they’ve got to step up a gear to get to the top. Horses like Clan Des Obeaux, Diego Du Charmil, Black Corton, Dolos, Cyrname, horses that are capable of winning lots of races, and a lot of youngsters.”Tips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a13042bdae4548173b702fcc4c5fb4ff5b4e671d/0_176_4959_2975/master/4959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81925a2a0c728b7ec1495d8ede4afbc0","title":"premiership clubs finances sustainability","story":"Over the 21 years since its inception the Premiership has attracted good crowds but player wages are eating up revenue The new Premiership season kicks off at Ashton Gate on Friday night when promoted Bristol meet Bath. The clubs are run by the two richest men involved in the game, whose combined wealth is more than £2bn, but 21 years on from the tournament’s launch clubs remain mired in debt and the game is still a licence for backers to lose money.Cumulative losses for 2017-18 are expected to be £35m for the 12 clubs, an average of almost £3m each. Northampton were the first to announce their results last Friday: having posted a profit in the first 16 years of the century, they recorded a deficit for the second year in a row, hitting the league average of £2.9m.The Saints are one of the clubs run on sustainable lines, looking to spend what they earn and beholden to no one, but spiralling wage inflation and two unsuccessful seasons pushed them into the red. “We see a route to profitability but it will take up to four years,” said the Saints’ chief executive, Mark Darbon. “The market is very difficult. It is no coincidence that all clubs are losing money.”The Premiership launched 21 years ago this month. Clubs were then losing an average of £1.5m each and before the first season’s end the Monte Carlo-based copper trader Ashley Levett bailed out of Richmond after investing more than £8m, putting the club in administration, after which it dropped to the bottom of the league pyramid. “I do not know anyone with a sound business sense who would do this,” said Levett at the time. “Being an owner of a rugby union club is a complete lottery and I cannot go on throwing money down the drain.”Rugby union was then in its professional infancy, with teething troubles leading to protracted disputes between clubs, unions and the then International Rugby Board. Club owners were largely motivated by business rather than the sport and many followed Levett out, despairing at ever getting their money back, never mind make a return on it. They had little or no emotional investment in rugby in contrast benefactors today tend to be fans with bulging wallets who are recognising that the health of the club game demands financial planning, not splurging.“Rugby is not that young a professional sport now,” says the Wasps chief executive, Nick Eastwood, whose club were within a few minutes of being declared bankrupt six years ago. “We are in late adolescence. We should have grown up and learned our lessons. The game can become sustainable but only if we collectively make the correct decisions in the next four years and get costs under control.”Other than the debts, the club game is virtually unrecognisable from two decades ago. The first round of Premiership matches generated an average crowd of 5,674, with not one attendance nearing five figures. The average for the final round of last season was more than double that, at 11,860, with all six matches attracting 10,000 fans or more. No one rents a football club ground any more and only Sale, who play at a local authority-owned ground in Salford, do not have an asset to exploit commercially. A considerable sum has been spent on improving stadiums, training grounds and facilities, and pitches are no longer mudheaps.The average crowd at a Premiership match has virtually tripled since the start of professionalism and, if that figure is inflated by matches staged at venues such as Wembley, Twickenham, the London Stadium and St James’ Park, the majority of clubs regularly attract five-figure crowds. Bristol are guaranteed their highest attendance for the visit of Bath, despite the match being played on a Friday night, and expect to be close to a 26,500 sell-out. There will be few spare seats the following day in the five other matches. So why are benefactors still having to dig deep at the end of every season to balance the books?The main reason is wage inflation. Four years ago the clubs decided to invest more heavily on the rugby side, raising the salary cap over successive seasons to help compete with clubs in France, who do not have to worry about the upkeep of their grounds because they are municipally owned, and the Irish provinces. The cap this season is £7m, plus dispensation for allowances and two marquee players: Bristol are paying the New Zealand full-back Charles Piutau £1m a year and they have also signed the former Australia flanker George Smith.The cap will remain at the same level for three years. It will be reviewed before the 2020-21 season when the television contract for the Premiership comes up for renewal. “Clubs are no better off than they were 20 years ago and that is a real shame,” says the Leicester chief executive, Simon Cohen. “Revenues have risen significantly but the percentage that has gone to players has created difficulties and you are less able to invest in other aspects of the game. You want to spend more on infrastructure, the community and matchday experience for fans but wage inflation means you cannot.“We need to use the cap remaining the same for three seasons to reduce costs. Losing the second marquee player would be a significant help and in future we have to make sure the cap is based on actual revenue rather than projected income, as it has been. We now have the tools to make the financial side much better and we have to use them.”A fear of some is that Bristol, whose backer Stephen Lansdown is worth £1.7bn, may trigger another wage explosion through their acquisitiveness and purchasing power. “I sense from the ownership group that the emphasis is changing,” says the Gloucester chief executive, Stephen Vaughan. “A few years ago there was a win-at-all-costs mentality but now there is more togetherness. Self‑sustainability is becoming a priority but there can be the odd curve ball and Bristol coming up marks a big change in direction. They can unsettle the market, with marquee players at other clubs wondering why they are not getting paid the same as Piutau. That is not to suggest Bristol do not want to be well run and sustainable but they will be doing their utmost to survive in the Premiership. What club with their finances would not throw everything at it?”Lansdown rescued Bristol from bankruptcy in 2012, two years after Bruce Craig used some of the £956m he received from his company’s sale to buy Bath. Bristol have been rebranded as the Bears this season to provide a fresh impetus and, while Lansdown anticipates having to foot Bristol’s losses for the next four or five years, his drive is profitability. “Sustainability has to be the goal because no one can last for ever,” he said. “You owe it to the club, the supporters and staff to put it in a position where it can carry on for as long as it has been going previously and beyond.“Bristol is not profitable: the club was within a gnat’s whisker of going out of business when I took over and it has to become sustainable because I do not want to wish my life away. Equally, the last thing I want is for Bristol to collapse and that is why I intend to make sure that, at worst, it is breaking even. I sometimes ask myself why I do it: where does your business head go when you get involved in rugby? But I love sport and the city.”The newest owner is Simon Orange, who bought Sale two years ago when the Sharks were unable to get anywhere near the salary cap. This summer they signed the England wing Chris Ashton from Toulon and Orange, who originally envisaged helping the club tick over, is now planning its rise back to the top. “Higher wages are a big reason clubs are losing a lot of money but you cannot blame the players because they put their bodies on the line every week in a tough, short career and are entitled to get what they can get,” he says. “We have to build a sustainable model by growing revenues because I cannot imagine the club game will forever be propped up by wealthy owners.“I could be wrong: I am a massive Sale fan so could be here for 20 years, like Nigel Wray at Saracens. My company owns the club but unless we make it sustainable quickly, I might have to take it over personally. We have put in a good few million quid so far and will continue to do so for the next two or three years.“We have made massive improvements and with two or three top quality additions next season, reaching the cap, I do not see any reason why we cannot challenge. The first 20 years of professionalism saw the focus on rugby rather than business, which was totally understandable. It is now on becoming profitable and I am more enthusiastic than ever. My intention originally was to make the club sustainable without investing loads of money, even if it meant we were in the bottom half of the table, but now I am doing everything I can to get us up there and drive revenue.”Wray is the one survivor from the pioneers of the 1990s. His £40m-plus investment has helped Saracens move from tenants to landlords at the Allianz Stadium, where a new stand has been given planning permission, and the club’s work in the community sees the Saracens high school open next month in Collingdale, followed by a primary school in two years. Work off the pitch has fuelled success on it and turnover has trebled since the move to Barnet.“Every year our debt is written about,” says the Saracens’ chief executive, Mitesh Velani. “The club is not in debt and has nothing leveraged on it. It is a loan from our parent company, shareholder investment with no recourse. That will be seen when we release our latest set of accounts in a couple of months. We have a positive net asset value, although we have been loss‑making. We have a great opportunity to become sustainable but we have to control costs and look to the long term.”Saracens have put their leading players and coaches on long‑term contracts Gloucester and Northampton have reduced the size of their squads, replacing reserve players on around £60,000 a year with academy graduates and Worcester, whose financial performance last year was the worst of the 12, with an £8m loss that has hampered the search for new backers, have drawn up a new financial plan.In the past Premiership clubs have gone to the wall – Bedford, Richmond, London Scottish, Bristol and, most recently, London Welsh – but despite the losses there is no sign of anyone following them soon. “I sometimes pinch myself when I drive into the Ricoh Arena,” says Eastwood, who remembers counting down the seconds in 2012 before Wasps raised the £2m needed to prevent their becoming insolvent. “We were losing £4m a year when we were in Wycombe. Had we not moved to Coventry, there is a significant risk the club would not have survived.”They are still making a loss but the ground means their turnover is the second highest of any club in Europe. “You have to give owners immense credit: without their substantial investment, the clubs and England would not be where they are today. They hate losing money but they would hate losing their clubs even more. The flat salary cap gives us the opportunity to ensure that does not happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db5b8fc7e156893a9e6ad8aa450585be6b0e76cc/62_19_2163_1297/master/2163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44953f70324ccf9562ad60016f78d553","title":"us open jo konta novak djokovic heat","story":"As the mercury climbed, the players fell – literally in some cases – on a day better for tanning than tennis at the US Open. Britain’s No 1 woman, Johanna Konta, brought up on the northern beaches of Sydney but vulnerable to extreme heat in the past, was one of the non-medical casualties, while four others quit through exhaustion, cramping or injury.Konta lost to the sixth seed, Carolina Garcia, 6-2, 6-2 in an hour and a quarter as the afternoon sun battered the exposed Grandstand Court, where Marius Copil had earlier retired against Marin Cilic. He said a “left-arm strain” caused his withdrawal, although he was limping heavily and appeared spent and distressed.Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, remains the chief threat to the defending champion, Rafael Nadal, after looking out on his feet playing Marton Fucsovics. Against expectations the Serb recovered to see off the determined challenge of the unseeded Hungarian 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-0 in just under three hours on the main court, winning the last 10 games on the spin. He plainly benefited from the 10-minute break the tournament organisers introduced here on Tuesday for the first time, after the third set.“We both struggled,” Djokovic said immediately afterwards. “Towards the end of three sets I started hitting the ball. Before that it was survival mode.” To the amusement of the crowd and perhaps the bemusement of his wife, he added, “We both needed that break at the end of the third set. We had two ice baths. We were naked next to each other. It was quite a magnificent feeling, I must say.”Looking ahead to his second-round match against his compatriot Viktor Troicki on Thursday – expected to be another sweltering day – he said: “I’m praying to feel better. But you have these kind of days. A lot of players struggled today.”Having reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year and climbed to No 4 in the world, Konta has failed to get past the second round of any of this season’s four majors, tumbling 42 places in the world rankings. She did not blame the conditions, acknowledging her downfall was due solely to her opponent. “It was bloody hot,” she said. “My eyes are still burning – and I wasn’t even out there for very long.”Konta batted aside doubts about her American coach, Michael Joyce. “I feel happy with the relationship that we have. Coming into this year I was in a very unhappy place. The number one job was to get me into a happy place. I feel definitely that we’ve achieved that. We’ll work together as long as we feel it’s mutually beneficial.” The rest of her season reads: Tokyo, Wuhan, Beijing and Moscow.Garcia said courtside: “Today I served very well and I was able to read her serve better than usual but there were a lot of tough games.”Konta, unseeded in a major for the first time since Melbourne in 2016, when she made the semi-finals, hung on as best she could but Garcia was too savvy and sharp. She struck seven aces in a superb serving display that Konta could not match.Konta had reason to be concerned about the conditions, having collapsed here twice, most recently in the second round two years ago when she experienced a spike in her heart rate before recovering to beat the Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova in three sets.Earlier Caroline Wozniacki, one of the fittest players in tennis, found unique inspiration to beat the heat and Sam Stosur: alcohol.“I had the ice towels and used the shade a little bit,” the 28-year-old second seed said standing in the frying pan that is the Arthur Ashe stadium after a 6-3, 6-2 win sent her into the shelter of the locker room and on to round two. “It helped. But, to be honest with you, I imagine I’m on the beach with a margarita in hand. It was just about trying to think cool thoughts.”Pointing to her fiancé in the stands – the NBA star David Lee, hatless and dressed in a black T-shirt – Wozniacki observed, “He should buy a hat.”Stosur said later: “Everyone always talks about how hot Melbourne is, and, ‘Oh my god, it’s so bad and everything,’ but the US Open’s way worse than Melbourne.“There are more retirements here but, for some reason, we get the bad rap in Australia.”Kiki Bertens, who beat Kristyna Pliskova 6-0, 7-5, said: “It’s really warm and it’s tough to play, but I guess that’s the same for everyone.”Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko, who beat Andrea Petkovic in three sets, agreed. “It was very humid and also very hot but it was the same for both of us,” she said.Naomi Osaka, the Japanese 20th seed who grew up in Florida and beat Germany’s Laura Siegemund, 6-3, 6-2 in an hour and 18 minutes, saw it differently. “Everyone was complaining about it. I thought it was pretty decent. Florida summers are way worse,” Osaka said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6004c9527bd725a9c1d85c7d359b987abf189c7/257_305_3345_2007/master/3345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a595508376bd172584d312a0ac570775","title":"virat kohli ecb the hundred thumbs down","story":"• India’s captain declines being a guinea pig for The Hundred • ‘Commercialism is taking over the real quality of cricket’Virat Kohli has poured scorn on the ECB’s new 100-ball format called The Hundred, saying he does not want to be part of an experiment.The India captain said commercialism “is taking over the real quality of cricket” and as a Test player he would not join the England and Wales Cricket Board’s city-based competition when it launches in 2020, adding: “I cannot think of one more format.”Kohli is not convinced the ECB’s innovations, including five-ball overs bowled in pairs before changing ends each 10 deliveries, will lure a new generation of fans.In an interview with Wisden Cricket Monthly, Kohli said: “Obviously for the people involved in the whole process and the set-up it will be really exciting but I cannot think of one more format, to be honest.“I’m already very … I wouldn’t say frustrated but sometimes it can get very demanding of you when you have to play so much cricket regularly. I feel somewhere the commercial aspect is taking over the real quality of cricket and that hurts me.“I don’t want to be a testing sort of a cricketer for any new format. I don’t want to be someone who’s going to be part of that World XI who comes and launches the 100-ball format.“I love playing the IPL, I love watching the BBL, because you’re working towards something, competing against high-quality sides and it gets your competitive juices flowing. That’s what you want as a cricketer. I’m all for the leagues but not to experiment.”Kohli, though, still wants to play in the County Championship. A neck injury prevented him playing for Surrey before India’s tour.“County cricket always intrigued me. Unfortunately it couldn’t happen this time but I would love to come again. I’ve heard so much from so many players over so many years that it has really helped them understand their games even better.

The app costs £39.99 a year, or £5.99 a month, and comes with a thermometer.It uses a set of algorithms that indicate by means of “red” or “green” days whether a woman is at risk of pregnancy in the event of unprotected sex. To reduce the number of red “at risk” days in a month, women must take their temperature at the same time every morning to allow the app to track ovulation and menstrual cycle phases. However, if anything disrupts the routine – being hungover, smoking or getting up to go to the bathroom can affect body temperature – a reading must be skipped.However some experts have been sceptical, noting the app was less effective than many forms of birth control and required strict adherence to a temperature-taking routine, with the studies based on a self-selecting pool of users. Others have raised concerns about unwanted pregnancies. In January, the app was referred to Swedish authorities after 37 of 668 abortions sought at one hospital in Stockholm were for women who had been using the app as a method of contraception.Natural Cycles said in response to the ruling: “We respect the outcome of the investigation by the ASA into one Facebook advertisement, which ran for approximately four weeks in mid-2017. The investigation was initiated nearly 12 months ago and the advertisement was removed as soon as we were notified of the complaint.”The ASA warned the company behind Natural Cycles that it must not exaggerate the efficacy of the method as a form of contraception.Bekki Burbidge, of the Family Planning Association, said women needed to take care to avoid potential problems with such apps.“It’s important when using Natural Cycles that women are aware of all the things that might make it less effective, so we’re very cautious about using apps to prevent a pregnancy without getting help and support from a trained fertility awareness teacher,” she said.

And the Channel 4 team are just getting into their strideCan there be anything more delightful than a giant penis rendered in pink royal icing? Hours later, I’m still laughing to myself about it. “What are you holding?” Kim-Joy asks fellow baker Dan. “A baby,” says the stay-at-home dad, referring to the showstopper tableau of almond sugar cookie that supposedly depicts him carefully cradling his first child. It doesn’t look like a baby. “It looks like …” says Paul Hollywood, with a smirk, when Dan brings the baked portrait up to be judged. Go on, say penis. “A massive prawn.”The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4, 8pm) is back, and it is still a joy. Now in its ninth series, and the second in its new Channel 4 home, it shows no sign of getting stale. Aside from a few nods to evolving trends – there will be a vegan week, the makers announced – it is unchanged. Because why change a recipe as good as this? New judge Prue Leith, her confidence grown – despite a good joke at the start of the show about her gaffe last year when she tweeted the name of the winner ahead of the final – has proved to be a great successor to Mary Berry. She is tarter, to Berry’s icing-sugar sweetness. The presenters, Sandi Toksvig (enough of an anarchic edge to stop her going full head girl) and Noel Fielding (kind-natured, with a new ElvisShakin’ Stevens haircut) are endearing and more assured this year. Hollywood, the only survivor from the original, seems to have weathered the lingering feel over the last series that he was being grabby by staying with the show. Sun and birdsong drench the famous tent (“Like, the actual tent,” says Briony, from Bristol, and one of my favourites): the producers continue to resist updating the pastel fantasy farmhouse kitchen decor, and one or both of the judges will turn their nose up at any inclusion of rosewater. It is all comfortingly familiar.The three patisserie-under-pressure challenges begin. We kick off with biscuit – rather than cake – week, which is apparently what passes for controversy in the Bake Off tent. The bakers have to make 24 identical “regional biscuits”. The 12 contestants seem an intriguing bunch, but could be more representative (there’s a weirdly large number of people from Yorkshire). Rahul, a nuclear scientist, says his mum loves his biscuits mental health worker Kim-Joy’s orange blossom-flavoured biscuits are inspired by a hair conditioner she likes Terry, an artist with one of those pleasingly twiddly moustaches, is decorating his ginger shortbread biscuits with pictures of lambs. Everyone finds it all very stressful, of course, except for Karen, who works in a supermarket she easily finishes her Yorkshire parkin biscuits and has time to sit down with a celebratory packet of salt and vinegar crisps. “Would you like a crisp?” she asks Dan, clearly trying to put him off his game under the guise of generosity.One of the enjoyable tensions of Bake Off is the feeling of gentle, cosy unity, when everyone really just wants to win. Spot the sour faces when someone’s bake is praised. The psychology of the bakers is endlessly fascinating. What makes someone like Terry seem to sag like a sunken sponge when his biscuits are criticised (“It’s a rough old biscuit,” says Hollywood), when Ruby, a project manager, comes out fighting? “I thought biscuits were meant to be dry,” she says, punchily.The technical challenge is to make a Wagon Wheel, which immediately put those not born in Britain at a disadvantage. Antony, an Indian-born banker, has never heard of them Manon, from France, calls it a “wheely wagon”, although she manages to comes third. Toksvig confesses she has never eaten a Wagon Wheel – but then again, she adds, she didn’t have a Pot Noodle until she was 55.The showstopper challenge seems unusually difficult for a first episode: the bakers have to make a picture using several layers of biscuit and icing, depicting themselves in a memorable scene. It is stressful to watch – there’s a lot of huffing, red faces and shaky hands. “I’m losing it,” says Ruby of her triple-layer, 40-piece marathon – literal and metaphorical – scene. She confesses she has never managed to finish it in time during her practice runs at home, and she can’t get this one done.One of the best things about Bake Off is that it values effort and pride in one’s work compare this with, say, the tiresome Celebrity MasterChef, which started last week, where the contestants like to boast about how rubbish at cooking they are.

You’ve met the contestants, we know there’s going to be a vegan week, but who triumphed tonight?So that’s it for Week One! I’m more shattered than a box full of hammered toffee. Seems like a decent bunch of bakers this year, am looking forward to a fun series, and it’s lovely to be back at the liveblog helm. Let’s do this all again next Wednesday for Cake Week, I’m off to refine my list of sponge-based puns. In the meantime, feel free to come and say hi on Twitter @heidistephens if you’re passing. Have a great week! HxFinal judgement time! Paul likes Manon’s baking, and loves Briony too. Terry pulled it off in the Showstopper, but Imelda and Ruby are both in the firing line. First Star Baker is...MANON! But sadly, Imelda has to go back to her overbaked Mayo mountain. What a shame, I quite liked her. So who will be the first Star Baker, and who’s leaving this week? I reckon Manon or Briony for Star Baker, and maybe Imelda to leave?Who’s left? Briony’s has done Bristol proud, and Manon’s mountain selfie is exquisite. Terry’s brandy snap death mask has a marvellous Van Gogh thing going on, I love it. Is it enough to save Tache Terry? I love a tense finish.Judgement time! Dan’s selfie is him holding a big pink dildo, but it’s very tidy. His biscuits are delicious. Kim-Joy’s impressionist effort is very artistic, but Luke’s lurid Vegas trip is a bit underbaked. We’re moving through these too quickly, I can’t see them properly.  Rahul’s first spring is marvellously floral, and I love Karen’s Dame Edna selfie. Imelda gets decapitated by Paul, but her head is a bit stale and bland. Ruby finished the London Marathon, but failed to finish her biscuit selfie.Adverts are very much the liveblogger’s friend. Just saying.Mostly this all looks like a right mess. Shaky icing all round. This is too stressful, I’d rather climb Kilimanjaro.Terry has burned his biscuit base, and it’s all getting a bit tense. Kim-Joy has got about 17 different colours of icing, and seems quite chilled about it all. Ruby is way behind time, which I think might turn out to be Ruby’s signature move.Terry is moulding his face with a brandy snap, laminated with raspberry jam. Paul looks dubious. Imelda’s biscuits are celebrating a fun day out in Mayo, including an overbaked mountain.Kim-Joy’s selfie is taken at a shrine at sunset. There’s never a bad time to eat biscuits.Have just noticed that, after several seasons of using the Kenwood K-Mix, the mixers are back to Kitchenaid.

The agency, he said, had used unfair tactics against suspects and intimidated judges and lawyers.“An amnesty should be given to those who have been prosecuted and convicted through the excesses,” Giuliani said, claiming “many innocent people” had been jailed.Giuliani’s remarks aligned him with political forces in Romania who last month succeeded in ousting the country’s top corruption prosecutor, who had pursued senior politicians, prompting tumultuous public protests.Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, said in his letter he supported legitimate efforts to curb corruption. But he protested repeatedly about what he claimed were recent excesses in Romania.The letter was written under the letterhead of Giuliani Partners, his private consultancy firm, and did not mention his role as personal lawyer to the American president.It was unclear whether the letter was sent at the urging of any third party. Messages left for Giuliani and his company on Tuesday were not immediately answered. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.The state department moved to distance itself from Giuliani’s intervention. Asked if the US agreed with his remarks, a spokesman said: “Romania until recently has shown considerable progress in combating corruption and building effective rule of law. We encourage Romanians to continue on this path.”The ambassador’s response in turn angered the Romanian foreign ministry, which said in a statement his words “does not represent the position” of the government. It said Maior was being recalled to Bucharest to discuss his remarks.The ministry also noted that the country’s ambassadors should “refrain from public statements that could negatively affect bilateral relations with other states”.Last month, Iohannis fired the head of the country’s anti-corruption directorate, Laura Codruta Kovesi, who had led an aggressive push to prosecute corruption among the Romanian elite. Earlier moves by the government to rein in Kovesi prompted waves of street demonstrations.Romania scores 48 out of 100 on a perceived government corruption scale measured by Transparency International, where 0 is the most corrupt and 100 least. Romania ranks joint 59th out of 180 countries, alongside Greece and Jordan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce199b12ab0ce6e9bc31d851dbf253af0b052020/0_111_5487_3293/master/5487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9df220dc51176e4e874a9efce5f0cac","title":"indian farmers despair marauding cows uttar pradesh","story":"Herds of cows abandoned by dairy farmers because of anti-slaughter laws are causing chaos in the Uttar Pradesh countrysideBy day, Munidev Tyagi is a farmer, growing rice, maize, lentils and sorghum. By night, he turns watchman, guarding his fields in Sahibpur village in Uttar Pradesh against the stray cows that trample and maraud on his fields, eating his precious crops.He is not a happy man.“I don’t get more than a couple of hours sleep. The last few crops were badly damaged. It’s a huge problem. I ward them off with my son’s cricket bat but they keep coming back,” said Tyagi.The stray cows, numbering hundreds, belong to dairy farmers in the area. Once they cease to give milk, farmers can’t afford to keep feeding them. Previously, they used to sell unproductive cows to the local abattoir for a small sum of money. But now, with the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh aggressively enforcing anti-cow slaughter laws, the situation is very different.The BJP has closed down the small butcher’s shops (mainly Muslim-owned) that used to dot the countryside. In addition, it has mobilised its supporters: bands of right-wing Hindu “gau rakshaks” or cow vigilantes who patrol the countryside like private militias, ready to rain violence on anyone selling or buying a cow for slaughter.Having stoked Hindu passions over the cow to come to power, the Narendra Modi government effectively legitimised cow vigilantes who have lynched Muslims and Dalits, who they believe are slaughtering cows.Human Rights Watch reported that in the two years up to April 2017 at least 10 Muslims, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed during mob attacks related to the campaign against beef consumption.Fear of these attacks has meant that in many parts of India, cows have become the farmer’s enemy. Sleep-deprived and frantic to protect their crops, farmers hold night-long vigils, spend money they can ill afford on fencing or putting barbed wire around their fields, and arm themselves with sticks and stones. In some cases, they have thrown acid on cows.As a Hindu, Tyagi reveres the cow. But not so much that he is willing for them to ruin his livelihood.“It’s madness. The dairy farmers in my village don’t let their cattle loose here because we know them. They let them loose in another village. The cows from other villages are let loose in my village. I can’t spend my life shooing away cows. I’ve got other things to do. But the BJP cares more about cows than farmers,” said Tyagi.Cow slaughter has been banned for years in about 20 of India’s 29 states out of respect for the sentiments of Hindus who venerate the cow. But in reality, officials were rarely bothered about what was happening on the ground in remote villages where Hindu farmers regularly sold their unproductive cows to the local Muslim butchers. This trade, albeit technically illegal, flourished.In March 2017, the Uttar Pradesh government closed down hundreds of what it called “illegal” abattoirs, leaving farmers with nowhere to take their cows. Other BJP state governments have also shut down cattle fairs where farmers used to sell unproductive or ageing cows either for meat or leather. “All farmers used to sell, under the radar, their old cows. Do you know much fodder costs? Do you know how many men it takes to lift a sick cow to clean the shed? After stopping giving milk, a cow can live for another 20 years. Do they feed their children or their cows? It’s absurd to expect a farmer to keep them just because your ideology says so,” said political commentator Chandra Bhan Prasad.Radha Kant Vats who runs a cow shelter in the Indian capital, says that farmers should hand over unproductive cows to cow shelters like his. “We will look after them and give them an old age full of dignity and love.”Most BJP politicians also say the same thing but state-run cow shelters are in short supply and in many of them cows are kept hungry and in overcrowded and filthy conditions. Many of the animals die of starvation or neglect.Earlier this month, angry villagers chased a herd of cows into a shelter in Chhattisgarh state and locked them in. Reports said 18 died of suffocation.Meanwhile, the cow’s enhanced social status has become something of a running joke in India. Stand-up comic Varun Grover asks audiences if they have noticed a distinctly more confident demeanour in the stray cows on the roads.“Before they used to be apologetic, clinging to the sides of the roads, taking up little space. Now, they park themselves bang in the middle as though to say ‘hey, it’s our time now’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"smart","story":"Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside traditional CAO system"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3604378.1534953049!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the secret teacher i m on my 79th successive day off","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers’ obscene summer holidays are a precious source of vital nutrition for begrudgers. Photograph: iStockI’m running out of holidays. I still have two weeks to come in 2018, and in most jobs that would mean that I still have plenty of holidays left.I am on my 79th consecutive day off, counting all the weekends and bank holidays (I’d only be on day 56 if I didn’t count these, but it’s hard to round that up to three months and I want to be fair to the begrudgers).Now that we are all into wellbeing and mindfulness and cultivating our own self-worth rather than comparing ourselves with the Joneses, begrudgers are becoming an endangered species.Teachers have a duty to do what they can to help them survive, and our obscene summer holidays are a precious source of vital nutrition.I have yet to meet a classy begrudger on this topic, a well-informed and articulate one who knows that correcting the summer exams and writing school reports take up the best part of, if not more than, a week of our holidays.We don’t actually teach then, and of course all non-teaching time is time off. Similarly, even if teachers do courses over the summer and read and prepare school-related material, they are off work.No monetary gain and certainly no additional holidays in lieu. There surely isn’t any need anyway, because as everyone knows, teachers have such amazing holidays that an odd bit of work here and there will hardly do us any harm.And anyway, when I do go back to work, isn’t teaching little more than a part-time job, even though I am one of the lucky teachers to have a contract for full hours?The “fact” that a teacher supposedly works little more than 20 hours per week gets massive airtime.While it is true that an Irish secondary school teacher only teaches 21 hours and 20 minutes per week, there is more to that than most people think, and we certainly aren’t “off” the rest of the time. The teaching contract for Irish teachers focuses primarily (if not exclusively) on teaching time.This is unusual by international standards, because the teachers’ contract in many OECD countries includes recognition of the essential work that teachers do beyond the time actually spent delivering their classes. So what exactly is this essential work that teachers do while they are “off”?Teaching a subject that is allocated, say, four class periods of 40 minutes per week means teaching eight different class groups. Assuming that each of those groups has 25-30 pupils, that’s more than 200 pupils.This, of course, equals the number of copybooks a teacher would check per week if that were in fact physically possible.It certainly represents the number of inidual pieces of classwork, homework or tests to be corrected regularly, even if different subject areas or schools vary in their specific demands.We write school reports at least three times a year, too, one per pupil in fact. We could hardly expect the begrudgers to let us off with anything less, what with those record-breaking holidays we have.Are we doing enough to earn them anyway? After all, our school year isn’t even that long compared with other EU countries.Our critics cannot emphasise loudly or often enough how appalling it is that we are off for the whole month of June when most of our EU counterparts are still working.They are correct about teachers elsewhere teaching further into the summer, but I wonder why they do not give the complete picture.Average teaching time in secondary schools across the EU countries in the OECD comes in at 668 hours, while in Ireland we teach an average of 735. Would I be pushing my luck to point out that putting in more hours over a shorter school year actually makes the job harder? Most definitely. People just don’t want to know.Full-time teaching for 35 or 40 years makes for a demanding marathon of a career. Ours is a profession that almost everyone has an opinion on, regardless of whether they have ever taught a class.And here’s the rub: sitting on one side of the desk as one of 30 is something we have all done, but standing solo on the other is a different matter entirely. Not for nothing does it now take six years in Ireland to make that transition across the desk.For those who think that’s unnecessary, surely there’s a reality TV programme waiting to be made: Teach for a Week, anyone? Probably not. Teacher for a summer is the only gig the begrudgers are really after.The “secret teacher” is a practising secondary school teacher who will write an occasional series of anonymous columns.

File photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy Letters purporting to come from the occupant of a property owned by Pat McDonagh of Supermac’s objecting to a competing fast food outlet proposed for Eyre Square in Galway was the subject of a private investigation which could not find the alleged objector living at the address given.The proposal for a fast food outlet at No 30 Eyre Square was made in 2012 in the name of BEB Practical Property Partnership. When the Hillbilly’s plan was being considered by Galway City Council, objections were submitted from an Ashling O’Doherty who gave an address at “24 Eyre Square Townhouses”.No 24, and at least five other apartments in this development, were owned at the time by Mr McDonagh.On behalf of BEB, a private investigating company, Premier Investigations Insurance and Legal Services, sought to deliver a letter to Ms O’Doherty at this address but was not able to.According to a report, dated February 5th 2013 and written by Áine O’Friel of Premier Investigations, the actual occupant of No 24 Eyre Square Townhouses, was not Ashling O’Doherty but one Tony O’Brien who told Ms O’Friel that “Ashling O’Doherty was not living at the address and that he had been living there since September 2012”.A fast food outlet eventually obtained planning permission but No 30 is now a branch of the Caffè Nero franchise.Meanwhile, it has emerged an environmental consultant, Howard Williams, chief executive of Inis Environmental Consultants Ltd, wrote a personal letter of support for Mr McDonagh’s Supermac’s motorway service station plans for the M18 near Ennis in Co Clare. Inis was retained by Mr McDonagh to assist with the Ennis planning application, including carrying out a bat survey. Mr Williams’ name also appears among the 180 or so alleged letters sent to Clare Council purporting to support the planning application for the M18 service station. But the address given – 25 Cloonbeg, Shanballa Estate, Lahinch Road – while registered as owned by Mr Williams is not the address at which he resides.Questions to Mr Williams – sent to him by email and text last week and again yesterday – went unanswered. However, he told Clare FM on Tuesday he had no part in generating the letters and was merely the delivery man.He said he was not hired by Mr McDonagh to orchestrate a campaign of support for the service station plan. Mr McDonagh has said that he (Mr McDonagh) agreed to underwrite the €20 fee for each of the letters of support submitted.Mr Williams has admitted being the person who delivered the 180 or so supportive letters to Clare County Council offices.At least 40 of the people in whose names the letters were submitted under forged signatures have said they did not submit letters. One was submitted in the name of a dead person and contained a signature.“The letters weren’t dealing with planning issues,” he said. “They were dealing with, they were letters of support . . . so there was no planning issues raised in it. The planning process is not influenced by letters of support.”A series of questions to Mr McDonagh’s public relations spokesman yesterday went unanswered."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3610779.1535494987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gavin duffy caught rapid using council logo on presidential brochures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Gavin Duffy pitches his presidential nomination campaign to  Kildare County Council members  in Naas, Co Kildare. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Presidential hopeful Gavin Duffy has admitted he did not seek permission to use Kildare County Council’s Local Enterprise Office logo on his political campaign material. Presidential hopefuls were in Kildare on Monday to pitch their campaign promises.Four of them – Gavin Duffy, Joan Freeman, Jimmy Smyth and Kevin Sharkey – made presentations to county councillors in Naas in a bid to secure nominations to run for the presidency.Mr Duffy, an investor on RTÉ TV show Dragons’ Den, distributed his brochures to Kildare County Councillors as part of his presentation to the council. When asked at the presentation about corruption, he said one of the planks of his campaign was integrity.“I don’t think there is anything that can be found in my past that will cause embarrassment to me or my children, in my business or personal life.”Cllr Fiona McLoughlin Healy of Kildare County Council said the use of the council’s Local Enterprise Office logo, “whether intended to or not, had the unfair effect of an endorsement of him by the council”.In a series of conflicting statements on Twitter, Mr Duffy initially claimed he had sought permission to use the logo, but when challenged by Ms O’Loughlin Healy on the matter, he admitted he did not. “The logo was to demonstrate that I have worked regularly with @LEO_Kildare and certainly was not intended as political endorsement,” he tweeted. “It was never intended to be seen as a political endorsement by LEO Kildare of my seeking a nomination from Kildare and if it has been interpreted as that, which I now accept it could be, I apologise for the infringement and thank you for drawing my attention to it,” he tweeted. He tweeted that he had been “caught rapid”, had made a mistake in an earlier tweet by saying he had received permission, and had moved to correct it. He said he has previously undertaken paid work doing workshops for Kildare Local Enterprise Office. The formal order calling the 2018 presidential election has been signed by Minister for Local Government Eoghan Murphy, who said polling day is to be held on Friday, October 26th.The signing of the order kick-starts a 28-day period during which hopefuls can seek to secure a place on the ballot paper to take on President Michael D Higgins in the autumn.

This differs from current dietary advice.”Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation said: “Eating well means looking at your diet as a whole, rather than focusing too much on inidual elements. Meat and dairy can contribute to a healthy, balanced diet as long as they’re eaten in moderation along with plenty of fruits and vegetables, pulses, wholegrains and nuts.”Until two years ago, Public Health England advised that around 15 per cent of calories should come from dairy. But two years ago it cut this to 8 per cent - and recommended consumption of low-fat versions.Nutrition and dietingTrump\u0026#39s accusations that search results are \u0026#39rigged\u0026#39 against him denied by GooglePuerto Rico revises Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to almost 3,000Advert for \u0026#39Natural Cycles\u0026#39 contraceptive app banned for exaggerating effectivness Farmers should \u0026#39smile\u0026#39 at their livestock to produce better meatBees become \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to harmful pesticides, scientists warnTelecoms firms want to bury new \u0026#39end of contract\u0026#39 alerts in monthly bills Thousands of bees swarm New York Times Square hot dog stand Drinking and smoking narrows arteries by 17, new study warnsTexas police search for woman seen in mysterious doorbell video Facebook \u0026#39founder\u0026#39 claims social media site has caused \u0026#39countless deaths\u0026#39 by failing to protect usersJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s \u0026#39Zionist\u0026#39 remarks \u0026#39the most offensive since Rivers of Blood\u0026#39, says former chief rabbiYou\u0026#39re off!

We co-ordinate local volunteers and charity groups and take as much as we can for the homeless and refugees in Calais and Dunkirk but realistically, up to 90 per cent gets left behind.”Teresa Moore, director of environmental campaign group A Greener Festival, said her own research indicated that a large proportion of festival goers believed their tents would be given to charity.Thousands of tents abandoned after the Reading FestivalShe said that when one or two festivals had advertised the fact that charities collected abandoned tents, the number left behind shot up.“It backfired and since then, most festivals have rowed back from that, urging people to take them with them,” she said. “But in a way, it is too late.”Some festival goers expressed disappointment that they unwittingly added to the waste problem.Emily Wadsworth, 25, from Clerkenwell, London, who attended the Secret Garden festival last year, said: When it ended, we collected rubbish and helped to clear the campsite. I was going to take my tent with my to reuse it, but we were told that we could donate them to the refugees in Calais so that’s what we did.“It’s really disappointing that people are misled into thinking they are helping when they are actually creating more waste. I would never have donated my tent if I thought it would just go into a landfill.A 2015 report by the think tank Powerful Thinking revealed that UK festivals created 23,500 tons of waste and 68 per cent went to landfill or incineration.Despite organisers’ efforts, the average recycling rate of the biggest festivals remained under 50 per cent.Mr Wedge, 25, who was working at the Leeds festival site yesterday (TUES) alongside around 200 volunteers, said one of the biggest problems was that tents were increasingly being sold at knockdown prices and were often advertised as “festival tents,” suggesting they were disposable. He said a culture shift was needed to alter perceptions of acceptable behaviour on a festival site.“It hasn’t really changed in the last seven years,” he added.“Many of the festivals have these green initiatives but the message just isn’t getting through.”Volunteers tackle the clean up project after the Reading FestivalMr Wedge said some festivals were more receptive to recycling and salvage than others, giving volunteers such as his at least two days to collect as much as they could.Others, often because they need to return the land to its original use, bring in the waste management company almost immediately and the site “just gets bulldozed”.Ms Moore added: “Most people are aware of the environmental impact but it’s just not on their radar, they aren’t thinking about it.”She said various festivals, including Isle of Wight and Download, had successfully trialled initiatives such as having “green fields” for campers who commit to taking their tent and are offered better facilities in return which would slowly be expanded.Emma Priestland, Friends of the Earth campaigner, said: “There was a time when charities could collect a small amount of left-behind tents and donate them to a good cause, but increasingly tents are flimsily constructed so they become single-use items.“This is large-scale, ugly littering. Awareness of the senseless damage of plastic pollution is higher than it’s ever been, so it’s inexcusable that people don’t recognise abandoned tents for what they are: even more avoidable plastic pollution.”Please review our commenting policyTrump\u0026#39s accusations that search results are \u0026#39rigged\u0026#39 against him denied by GooglePuerto Rico revises Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to almost 3,000Advert for \u0026#39Natural Cycles\u0026#39 contraceptive app banned for exaggerating effectivness Farmers should \u0026#39smile\u0026#39 at their livestock to produce better meatBees become \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to harmful pesticides, scientists warnTelecoms firms want to bury new \u0026#39end of contract\u0026#39 alerts in monthly bills Thousands of bees swarm New York Times Square hot dog stand Drinking and smoking narrows arteries by 17, new study warnsTexas police search for woman seen in mysterious doorbell video Facebook \u0026#39founder\u0026#39 claims social media site has caused \u0026#39countless deaths\u0026#39 by failing to protect usersJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s \u0026#39Zionist\u0026#39 remarks \u0026#39the most offensive since Rivers of Blood\u0026#39, says former chief rabbiYou\u0026#39re off!

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":null,"title":"wasp parasite fossil discovery insects x rays","story":"Created with Sketch.Rare fossils capture parasites sustaining themselves by feeding on developing fliesClick to followThe IndependentPrehistoric parasitic wasps found frozen inside fossilised victims named \u0027Xenomorphia\u0027 after terrifying creature in Alien filmsScientists have found rare evidence of ancient parasites in action, using advanced techniques to reveal the unpleasant process by which long-extinct wasps preyed on developing insects.\u0026nbspDr Thomas van de Kamp and colleagues examined over 1,500 tiny fossilised fly pupae from around 23 to 66\u0026nbspmillion years ago discovered in France.Within these cocoon-like structures that maggots form before emerging as flies, the scientists used advanced X-ray techniques to reveal adult parasitic wasps growing.In total they found 55 cases of parasitisation taking place, frozen in time inside the tiny fossils for millions of years.Based on this evidence, it seems these wasps injected a single egg inside each pupa, which they grew and consumed the developing fly for sustenance.The scientists\u0026nbspdescribed four new species of wasp, and used a combination of imaging techniques to produce animated reconstructions of one of them, which they termed Xenomorphia resurrecta.The genus “Xenomorphia“ is named after the creature from the Alien\u0026nbspscience fiction film series, which is known as Xenomorph and\u0026nbspdevelops in a similar way to these wasps.\u0026nbspFossil evidence of parasites in action is extremely rare, and the researchers welcomed the opportunity to study the history of parasitic wasps similar to species observed today.“Our project proves that it is worthwhile to study old collections afresh with latest technology,” said Dr\u0026nbspvan de\u0026nbspKamp.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/02/14/teenager-depression.jpg","title":"teenage girls self harm report childrens society","story":"Created with Sketch.Findings prompt concerns that shortfall in social care funding and lack of support in schools leading to \u0027crisis in children\u0027s mental health\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA study by the Children’s Society estimates that nearly 110,000 children aged 14 may have self-harmed across the UK during the same 12-month period, including 76,000 girls and 33,000 boysNearly a quarter of girls aged 14 have self-harmed in the past year, an alarming report shows, prompting renewed calls for the government to address the “crisis in children\u0027s mental health”.A study by the Children’s Society estimates that nearly 110,000 children aged 14 may have self-harmed across the UK during the same 12-month period, including 76,000 girls and 33,000 boys.Almost half of teenagers who said they were attracted to people of the same gender or both genders had harmed themselves. Children from lower-income households also had a higher than average risk of self-harming.One in four children worry about their appearance, poll showsOne in 10 teenage girls referred to mental health services last yearChildren needing specialist mental health treatment up by a thirdThe findings have prompted concerns that a shortfall in social care funding and difficulties accessing mental health support are pushing a growing\u0026nbspnumber of teenagers to crisis point.One young person told the charity: “I felt like self-harming was what I wanted to do and had to do as there was nothing else I could do. I think there is help for young people but not the right kind of help.She added: ”Feeling not pretty enough or good enough as other girls did contribute towards my self-harming.”The research found girls were significantly less happy than boys with their lives as a whole, and with each aspect of life measured in the survey. The largest gender gap was for appearance – over 1.5 points difference on a 10-point scale.It comes after a study by the University of Manchester last October found self-harm among teenage girls (10-19) had\u0026nbsprisen by 68 per cent in three years.Matthew Reed, chief executive at the Children’s Society, said: “It’s vital that children’s well-being is taken more seriously and that much more is done to tackle the root causes of their unhappiness and support their mental health.“Schools can play an important part in this and that is why we want the government to make it a requirement for all secondary schools to offer access to a counsellor, regularly monitor children’s well-being and have their mental health provision assessed as part of Ofsted inspections.“Issues like appearance, gender stereotypes and sexuality should be included in the new Relationships and Sex Education curriculum.“However, early support for vulnerable children and families in the community, which can help prevent mental health problems from developing, is also vital, and ministers must urgently address the £2bn funding shortfall facing council children’s services departments by 2020.”Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the huge rates of self-harm among were largely due to a shortfall in social care funding and family support, as well as a lack of community child and adolescent psychiatrists.“These disturbing figures highlight the sheer number of young people continuing to struggle with mental health issues,” she said.“Bullying at school – including being teased about your sexuality - has been highlighted as a particular worry for young people, and so we welcome the additional funding promised by the government for early intervention in schools.“Children must be able to access help for their mental health difficulties from services before they fall into crisis.”Cllr Roy Perry, vice chairman of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said cuts to local authority budgets meant councils were finding it increasingly difficult to support children.“Many councils are being forced to cut early intervention work, including youth services, which helps children avoid reaching crisis point, perform better at school and avoid mental health issues in later life,” he said.“This is why we are calling for councils and schools to be given the funding to offer independent mental health counselling so pupils have access to support as and when they need it.Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said: “Mental health is one of the biggest health epidemics of our time and is strongly linked to social disadvantage. These latest figures further emphasise this and highlight just how urgent the need for appropriate action is.\u0026nbsp“We know that poor mental health can lead to poor employment prospects and an increased risk of drug and alcohol use, so it is important that support is fully inclusive, joined up and offered to children and young people early to give them the best possible chance in later life.” \u0026nbspHealth news in pictures152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2552 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2652 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2752 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2852 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2952 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say3052 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4252 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4352 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4452 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4552 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4752 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4852 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4952 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.5052 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 5152 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4352 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4452 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4552 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4752 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4852 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4952 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.5052 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 5152 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP.

when up to 200 local party branches will attempt to make a further referendum official party policy.Now a leaked memo from the People’s Vote has told supporters: “This campaign is not about Jeremy Corbyn and we must not – will not – use it to damage or undermine the party’s leadership or attack them personally.”Penned by the group’s head of communications, Tom Baldwin, it comes amid growing confidence that there will be a showdown at Labour’s conference in Liverpool.The ruling body of the grassroots pro-Corbyn group Momentum will meet on Saturday to decide whether to canvas opinion, after more than 4,000 members signed a petition calling for a conference vote.The pressure illustrates a growing clamour from Labour members within Mr Corbyn’s base on the left of the party, as well

The EU is \u0026rsquounprecedented filth that doesn\u0026rsquot deserve our money\u0026rsquo                 \u0027Surprised if EU exists in 10 YEARS!\u0027 Farage\u0027s damning forecast on EUCountries that do not participate in relocation and which do not even deign to respond to Italy\u0027s request for help, should no longer receive European funds from us, and among these at the moment, is Hungary, they said.Mr Salvini sparked controversy when he refused to allow around 150 people to disembark from coast guard rescue vessel, the Diciotti, after they spent nearly a week docked at a port in Sicily.The right-wing deputy prime minister, who heads of League, only agreed to allow them off the ship after Albania, a non-EU country, and Ireland promised to take around 20 people each.Migrants were allowed off of the boat when Sicilian prosecutors declared they were opening an investigation into Mr Salvini for illegal confinement, illegal arrest and abuse of power.Matteo Salvini\u0027s meeting threatens the European Union\u0027s stability, according to a political expert (Image: )An emergency EU meeting in Brussels failed to reach a compromise for other member states to take in migrants from the boat.Fabio Castaldo, the leader of Five Star MEPs, accused Mr Orban of being a driving force behind the stalemate which has plagued EU decision making over migration.Mr Castaldo said: Orban is member of the European political group that, together with the socialists, is the main responsible for the current Europe\u0026rsquos stalemate.You cannot reject the principle of solidarity among European countries and, at the same time, define yourself as a friend of the Italian government.

We would be sanctioned by the court.Further damage would be that of not receiving back cohesion funds for agriculture and research in the event of non-contribution.Additional reporting by Maria Ortega            "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a iation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Several bathers were really afraid. He even lifted up a woman bather with his snout, mayor Roger Lars told the local newspaper Ouest France.The dolphin has been hanging around the Bay of Brest for months, swimming near the beaches of Plougastel-Daoulas, Logonna-Daoulas and Landevennec.He likes to frolic around tourist boats and even lets swimmers grip onto his dorsal fin and go for a ride with him, but recently he has become just a little too friendly.Locals have told of the sexed-up mammals antics, with several going into some detail about shocked tourists being confronted with the animal’s sexual arousal.Experts say dolphins appear to have frequent recreational sex and sometimes display sexual behaviour towards other species - including humans.They point out that they are very large wild animals and could cause serious injury - even inadvertently with a flipper - if they feel in any way threatened.But attacks or injury to humans by dolphins are so rare that a Breton lawyer says he plans to take legal action to have what he calls the “excessive” swimming ban flipped.“The mayor wants to make dolphins look like almost ferocious beasts, completely unpredictable and likely to drown people,” said Erwan Le Cornec.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it can’t come at the expense of the EU’s integrity.France wants to maintain a strong, special relationship with London, but not if the cost is the EU’s unravelling.

We will have to build a strategic partnership with the UK but the priority is rebuilding the EU.”During a speech at the Elsyee Palace in Paris, Mr Macron also called for a eurozone budget, EU army and a single asylum policy for the whole bloc.However, his rallying cry for togetherness was overshadowed by a furious tirade from Italy’s interior minister who ripped into the whole project as “filth”.Matteo Salvini berated eurocrats and other EU countries for what he sees as a failure to fairly share the burden from the continent’s migration crisis.His outburst showed how Europe, which has maintained a strong unity on Brexit, continues to be deeply divided on many other issues.The eurosceptic was infuriated after a row about who should take in asylum seekers rescued at sea in the Mediterranean.Coastguard ship the Diciotti was held at a port in Sicily with 150 migrants on board for nearly a week after Italian authorities refused to let it dock.Rome finally relented and let all asylum seekers disembark on Sunday after Ireland and non-EU Albania agreed to take some of them in.But Mr Salvini fumed: “Europe has demonstrated once again to be unprecedented filth that doesn’t deserve our money.”As the crisis escalated the country’s PM, Guiseppe Conte, threatened to veto the bloc’s next seven-year budget unless more help is provided.And deputy PM Luigi Di Maio blasted: “The EU has decided to turn its back on Italy once again. They want the 20 billion euros paid by Italian citizens? Then let them demonstrate that they deserve it and that they are taking charge of a problem that we can no longer face alone. The borders of Italy are the borders of Europe.”EU budget chief Gunther Oettinger hit back by pointing out Italy actually pays in around 16 billion a year, leaving a net contribution of just 3 billion. He also warned Rome that if it reneges on its budget commitment it would face “late payment interests” and “further heavy sanctions” in retaliation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

of painstaking research, he devised a “number-picking algorithm” which drew on a method he called “combinatorial condensation” - stay with us.Stefan realised that in some draws, the total cost of buying a ticket to play every possible combination was much lower than the grand jackpot prize.For example, if a game required six numbers ranging between 1 and 40 to be chosen, there would be 3,838,380 possible number combinations.If the jackpot was £10 million, and tickets cost £1 each, he stood to win a massive profit.Along with a group of friends, he bought huge amounts of tickets using all the possible combinations and ended up taking out the top prize — worth over £15,000 .After paying expenses, he was left with just £3,000, but it was enough to bribe officials and escape Romania’s Communist system, and move to Australia to start a new life with his wife and two kids.He eventually won the lottery 14 times without breaking a single law.Stefan persuaded a pool of investors to put their cash together to build a lotto syndicate.He also invented an automation system, with printers and computers using the algorithm to fill out tickets automatically using every combination of numbers.The group won 12 lotteries and won hundreds of thousands of smaller prizes across Australia and the UK.Lotto authorities cottoned onto the plot, and changed rules to ban computer-printed forms and bulk buying tickets.But Stefan had an audacious plan B.With the profits he’d already made, he planted scouts across the US and also developed a list of previous lotteries with jackpots that were at least three times higher than the total of all possible combinations.He set his sights on the Virginia Lottery, as its numbers only ranged between one and 44, which meant the total number of possible combinations was millions lower than in other games.He set up an official company, Pacific Financial Resources, and under it also developed a trust called the International Lotto Fund.He persuaded thousands of investors to pour cash into the fund, raising millions in the process.From a warehouse in Melbourne he employed 16 full-time staff to print out seven million tickets over three months, which he then mailed to an associate in the US.The syndicate won the jackpot and a host of smaller prizes.But while Mr Mandel’s method was not illegal, it still raised suspicions, and he was dragged into a four-year legal battle.He was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing — but while he managed to pocket millions from the win, his investors were left with much smaller payouts that promised.Mr Mandel filed for bankruptcy in 1995 and at one point spent 20 months behind bars in Israel thanks to an investment scam.All US states have since passed laws banning the use of Mr Mandel’s strategy.But despite his epic gamble, Mr Mandel downplayed the risks he had faced during a 2012 interview with the Romanian newspaper, Bursa.“I’m a man who takes risks, but in a calculated way,” he

assassins","story":"The two Scotland Yard detectives have trawled 5,000 hours of CCTV footage trying match faces in Salisbury at the time of the poisoning with images of Heathrow passengers.The two super recognisers are specialists in memorising and recognising faces and believed to be behind the identification of two suspects who the UK authorities now want to extradite from Russia.They were dispatched to Salisbury shortly after Sergei Skripal, 67, and daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with nerve agent Novichok, in March.It is believed they were shown images of known Russian agents suspected of operating in the UK before searching for their faces on Salisburys CCTV.Former detective chief inspector Mick Neville, who set up the squad, said: The two super recognisers were deployed immediately because of their special skills and they are still on the case. Ive no doubt theyve played a key role.They have an innate skill, you cant buy it and you cant teach it. They have a highly unusual ability in remembering faces, whether its from a picture, a bit of film or someone theyve met.They dont concentrate on the obvious, the greying hair or the moustache or the glasses, they look at the eyes, the mouth, the ears, the things that dont change. They can recognise a face from the tiniest glimpse of part of it.The intelligence agencies will have images of foreign agents who come here and once they are scanned by the super recognisers they will be imprinted in their memory.The squad was set up in the wake of the 2011 London riots and helped identify the killer of schoolgirl Alice Gross in West London in 2014.Police believe the Skripals, who both recovered from the attempted assassination, were poisoned by Novichok smeared on the front door handle of their Salisbury home.Mr Neville added: Sergei was living openly with his real name registered in the voters database and seemingly unconcerned at the possibility of being assassinated.But he may have had security because he was worried about being burgled and so might his neighbours, so its possible the would-be killers were caught on a camera in the act.Vehicles moving around with dashboard cameras might also have recorded an image.Its possible the attackers followed the Skripals into the city centre the next day to make sure that the poison finally worked and there are lots of cameras around the bench where the victims were found.Its a laborious part of the operation, but there is plenty of material for the super recognisers to work on.The Kremlin denies being involved in any Novichok poisoning plot.Dawn Sturgess, 45, died in June, just 10 days after coming into contact with Novichok believed to be stored inside a perfume bottle. Her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, survived but has since been rushed back to hospital with suspected meningitis.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jonathan Sacks said the Labour leader’s remarks were to the “most offensive statement” made by senior politician since Powell’s 1968 Rivers of Blood speech. Lord Sacks spoke out after video from 2013 emerged of Mr Corbyn saying “British Zionists” didn’t “understand English irony.” The Labour leader has insisted his remarks were taken out of context and he did not used the word Zionist as “a euphemism for Jewish people.” But Lord Sacks, the chief Rabbis from 1991 to 2013, said his comments were “divisive” and “hateful.”  “The recently disclosed remarks by Jeremy Corbyn are the most offensive statement made by a senior British politician since Enoch Powell’s 1968 ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech.   “It was divisive, hateful and like Powell’s speech it undermines the existence of an entire group of British citizens by depicting them as essentially alien,” Lord Sacks told the New Statesman magazine. He added: “We can only judge Jeremy Corbyn by his words and his actions. “When he implies that, however long they have lived here, Jews are not fully British, he is using the language of classic pre-war European anti-Semitism. “He has legitimised the public expression of hate, and where he leads, others will follow.  “Now, within living memory of the Holocaust, and while Jews are being murdered elsewhere in Europe for being Jews, we have an anti-Semite as the leader of the Labour Party and Her Majesty’s opposition.  “That is why Jews feel so threatened by Mr Corbyn and those who support him.”  His comments came amid reports Labour’s ruling National Executive committee could adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-semitism. The move would mark a change of heart by the Labour leadership which failed to endorse the definition at a previous NEC meeting.  A Labour party spokesperson said: This comparison with the race-baiting Enoch Powell is absurd and offensive.   Jeremy Corbyn described a particular group of pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense - not as a synonym or code for Jewish people.

The twins were, as babies, at the centre of an international scandal after being sold online to British couple Judith and Alan Kilshaw. At six months old they were caught up in a transatlantic battle after it emerged a US couple had already adopted the sisters, who were then snatched back by their birth mother Tranda Wecker and sold on to the Kilshaws for \u0026pound8,200. Now, nearly 18 years on, the Mirror has tracked down the sisters and can reveal how they left behind their distressing start in life after being settled with a loving church-going family.  Speaking exclusively to the Mirror just weeks after the twins started at university where they are studying social sciences, their adoptive mum tells how “her babies” have flourished.  The proud 56-year-old said: “At times it has been tough, sure it has, but they are our babies and we cannot be more proud of them. They have grown into fine young women, each with their own dreams and ambitions.  “Nothing will hold them back from their goals. From the day they were brought to us they have been raised with unconditional love. “God blessed them into our care and we are forever grateful.” The twins’ life is a world away from that of their birth mother, who has yet to find any stability, moving from one home to another and unable to hold down a job. Tranda was a 28-year-old mother of five when her four-month-old twins were adopted by a couple in San Bernardino, California, called Richard and Vickie Allen. Eight weeks later she talked the Allens into allowing her one last visit to say a final goodbye to the girls. However, after taking the twins out for the day she never returned.  On December 1, 2000, the Kilshaws arrived in San Diego, 100 miles south, where Wecker introduced them to her infant daughters. Two days later Vickie Allen’s brother confronted the couple at their hotel and demanded the babies back. The Kilshaws claimed that until that moment they knew nothing of the Allens, and they quickly left the state. Over the following week they drove with Wecker and her three-year-old daughter to St Louis, Missouri, to get the twins’ birth certificates, then on to Arkansas, where adoptions can be handled in as little as 10 days. On December 22 the adoption papers were completed during a five-minute hearing. Within a week the Kilshaws had taken the twins – by then renamed Kimberly and Belinda – to their home in Buckley, North Wales. The seven-bedroom farmhouse was shared with Judith’s younger daughter, their two sons, six dogs, more than a dozen cats, two ferrets, a horse, a pony and two pot-bellied pigs. As the controversy over the twins’ sale erupted the FBI looked into it in the US while then-Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed to ban such sales. Eventually Kiara and Keyara, who now live under different names that the Mirror has chosen not to reveal, were returned to the US after the courts removed them from the Kilshaws. They were flown to their home state of Missouri, where social services had already found a family for the girls. Their adoptive father, now 72, said from the home where the twins still happily live: “It was fate. “I remember seeing them on Good Morning America not long after they were handed over to the British couple. “I remember thinking to myself what a heartbreaking situation it was. “My wife was getting ready for work one morning and I was in bed having just retired, and I said, ‘Oh man, look at those cute little girls.’ “Not long after I received a phone call from social services and they said, ‘We’ve got some twin girls and they are overseas. Would you take them? They need a stable home’. “I felt it was my duty to take them. They brought them straight from the airport to our home and we have never looked back since.” The twin baby girls arrived at their home in Missouri in good health despite their ordeal. Most people welcomed the twins into their new surroundings, but after all the controversy not everyone agreed with the move. Their adoptive father said: “My wife lost some friends over the fact we had taken Kiara and Keyara.  “They thought they should be returned to Tranda, but social services didn’t want that to happen.” Living in Missouri for the early part of their lives, the girls were shielded from the scandal surrounding their dramatic start in life. Tranda Wecker failed to have any contact with the girls until 2006, when she launched a legal bid to gain access. Their adoptive mother said: “The girls were doing really well at the time. “They were extremely settled and very happy.” When Wecker went to court to gain access to the children, the courts ordered that it would only be permitted once the girls had been told their true identity by their adoptive parents and a social worker. “They were only six at the time,” said their mum. “But in truth, we’ve never once hidden the truth from them. They know who they are.” At the time of the contact, Tranda Wecker vowed to get the girls back but, much as she did in 2001, she later turned her back on them again. “The contact the girls have with Tranda is down to them,” their mum said. But Keyara doesn’t want anything to do with her.” The twins worked hard throughout school and took an active part in sports there. They both excelled in lacrosse and basketball as well as joining the school band, performing at their high school football team’s games. Now they have continued their passion by joining the band at their new university. For now, the two girls remain living at home with their parents, although they hope next year to move into halls of residence some 30 miles away. Although identical, the independent girls have grown up to have very different personalities. Keyara is known to be bubbly and outgoing while Kiara is more reserved and measured.

The struggle to track down a clean toilet can lead to tantrums and tears of frustration – and that’s just the parents! Families aren’t the only ones who suffer: elderly people out and about, taxi drivers, freelance workers and, of course, posties can all be affected too. We often take it for granted that there will be a loo about, but over the last 18 years the number of council-run public toilets in the UK has fallen from 3,084 in 2000 to 2,290 in 2018. That is a drop of nearly 800. Councils want to keep public conveniences open, but a typical toilet block costs between \u0026pound12,000 and \u0026pound15,000 a year to maintain and, with substantial reductions to budgets, they have had to make tough choices about where they spend their money.  It means locating a loo can often end in failure and, not surprisingly, it’s driving people round the bend. That’s why we are supporting the new campaign by Domestos, which is encouraging businesses across Britain to let people use their lavatories. The Use Our Loos campaign aims to tackle the demise of public toilets, and asks shops, cafes, restaurants and bars to offer the use of their facilities to the community – to improve availability and stop the problems that a lack of loos can cause.  It benefits the public AND businesses as public loos are important to local economies. Having safe, hygienic toilets can attract more visitors to towns and villages, and increase footfall at a time when the high street is being crippled by closures.  Domestos has a long and much-praised history of helping to give people access to cleaner and safer toilets, partnering with UNICEF for the last six years to create provision for people living in areas without adequate sanitation across the globe. With initiatives including money from Domestos bottles marked with UNICEF* going towards funding, UNICEF and Domestos have already helped more than 10 million people access cleaner, safer toilets. And they are going to help 10 million more. But Domestos realises it’s not just a problem which affects developing countries – it’s an issue here as well, so it’s turning its attention closer to home too. At its worst, a lack of public toilets can force people to stay at home for fear of finding themselves in an embarrassing situation, resulting in social isolation and difficulties in their everyday lives. At best, it creates a massive inconvenience and can spoil an otherwise happy family day out. That’s why Domestos believes that a clean, safe toilet should be within everyone’s reach in the UK – and so do we!

Lucy McHugh, 13, was found dead in woodland last month, 24 hours after she disappeared from her home. Police have been hunting for her killer for just over a month and today cordoned off an area of woodland a mile and a half from where her body was found. Large metal fences were put up around the area, where police said they believe scissors or a knife used to kill Lucy could have been dumped.  A dog walker discovered Lucy\u0027s body at Southampton Sports Centre, Hampshire, on July 26 - where she could have lay dead for almost 20 hours. The detective leading the murder investigation today appealed for anyone who saw a man in a dark jacket and blue jeans riding a dark coloured mountain bike away from the murder scene on the day Lucy went missing. Detective Superintendent Paul Barton said they believe the man cycled from the sports centre to Tanner\u0027s Brook, an area of woodland in the Shirley area of Southampton. Police tape has also been put up on the fencing, with police cars parked in front to stop people from entering the area.  Detective Superintendent Barton said: We have reason to believe that the murder weapon - a knife, scissors or other sharp implement - was discarded in this area and we are focusing our searches there. As part of our investigation, we are also looking to identify a man we believe cycled from the Sports Centre to this location that morning Lucy went missing. We are hoping that this new information jogs someone\u0027s memory. If you saw this man, please get in touch and help us find Lucy\u0027s killer.  Lucy disappeared from her home in the Millbrook area of Southampton just before 9am on July 25, with chilling CCTV footage from a Tesco store capturing some of her final movements before her death. The teenager is seen walking \u0027with purpose\u0027 in the footage, with detectives believing she was going to meet someone. Her disappearance sparked a desperate search by family, friends and police, but her tragically her body was discovered at around 7.45am the following morning. Stephen-Alan Nicholson, 24, was arrested in connection with the teenager\u0027s death but later bailed. He was then charged with failing to cooperate with police after he refused to tell them his Facebook password.

Gerald Gavan ploughed into the youngsters having initially drove at his target Billy McGregor in Glasgow\u0027s Castlemilk. A judge today watched graphic footage of the children being hurtled into the air as the 22 year-old hit both them and McGregor. One 14 year-old girl – who Gavan also reversed over - suffered a broken neck and required lengthy surgery. Gavan is now behind bars after he pled guilty to attempting to murder the six youngsters on March 24 this year.  The carpet salesman, of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, also admitted trying to kill McGregor in the same incident. He was remanded in custody at the High Court in Glasgow pending sentencing next month. Prosecutor Maryam Labaki said the background to this crime was a “family feud” involving a “fatality”. She added: “Gavan is associated with one side of that dispute.” Gavan\u0027s former co-accused Gary Owen – who had not guilty pleas accepted – is a relative of Jordan Owen wanted in connection with the play park shooting of Jamie Lee. The hit and run occurred after McGregor – also known as William Dearie – had gone to a local shop around 4pm. The children were meantime “talking and laughing together” in the same street.  As McGregor crossed the road towards them, he clocked Gavan\u0027s silver Vauxhall Astra heading at him. Miss Labaki: “The car accelerated and steered towards Billy McGregor travelling diagonally and mounting the pavement.” He failed in trying to dodge the car – but Gavan then carried on into the children on the pavement. The advocate depute added: “As the car collided with the group, six of them were struck causing them to be thrown up into the air in different directions. “Two of the children who had been sent flying were hit with such force that they were carried over a parked car landing on the ground opposite.” CCTV of the incident was played to the packed court. Distressed relatives of the young victims sobbed. One woman left the courtroom in tears. A 14 year-old girl was unable to get up. Gavan then reversed over her before “leaving the scene at speed”.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study also found knowing the secret to getting children to eat their five-a-day also featured as an essential parental know-how. How to make the perfect pancake, how to remove chewing gum from hair and being able to tell when a child should go from a car seat to a booster seat were also deemed vital pieces of information. How to effectively control screen time and having more than a basic understanding of what different emojis mean also made the list. The Bassetts Vitamins research which polled 2,000 mums, dads and carers also highlighted secrets to successful family meal times including how to get kids to eat their greens and knowing when to ‘pick your battles’. Skye Lucas-Banks from Bassetts Vitamins said: ‘When it comes to parenting, we know first-hand that it can sometimes feel like you’re caught in the cross-fire of everyday challenges – from tantrums and fussy eating, to gum-in-hair and other parental pleasures.  “So, when we find a tip, hack or approach that works, it’s second nature to pass it on. \u0027\u0027Our social and personal networks show we’re certainly not alone and it’s reassuring to know that someone else has found a great way to either get their kids to eat their veg or remember which shape to cut sandwiches into on a Thursday.” The study also found one fifth of parents have picked up tips while having a natter at the school gate with other mums and dads, or during a parents’ evening. Researchers also compared ‘old school gate’ with ‘new school gate’ parents, revealing interesting insights into the evolution of parenting advice. How to set up parental controls on devices and knowing different social media acronyms, such as LOL and GTG, featured high on modern parenting agendas.  By contrast more traditional tips were insisting on good manners and letting kids fail to help them learn. Thirty-six per cent of parents and carers swear by the teachings of their own parents, and one third of respondents said mum is still their primary go-to for parenting related questions, over dad. Nine in 10 agreed their parents’ generation have passed on a number of pearls of wisdom. And three in 10 said the words of advice they took on were ‘to be a parent and not a friend.’ Two-fifths of parents and carers still find they are learning on the job, picking up tips and tricks from every day parenting. The study also found a number of eating hacks parents swear by to help their young ones get their five-a-day.

Over the weekend. the five-year-old was chauffeured to the Queen\u0027s Balmoral estate in Scotland to watch his dad shooting the birds in the hills, the Scottish Mail on Sunday reported. But PETA have hit out at the event, calling animal shoots blood sports. Director Elisa Allen said the experience could damage George\u0027s psyche as there was a proven link between cruelty to animals in childhood and antisocial behaviour in adulthood.  The statement read: Very few people these days view shooting for sport as anything other than a violent perversion that hurts and kills beautiful birds who are minding their own business. For a child to be compelled to witness such casual killing – and by a parent, he looks up to, no less – is potentially as harmful to his or her psyche as it is to the bird\u0027s very life. It can desensitise children to the suffering of animals – which is cause for concern, given the well-established link between cruelty to animals in childhood and antisocial behaviour in adulthood – and could give George nightmares. To help him grow into a responsible, compassionate leader, his parents must teach him respect for all living beings. The Queen, 92, reportedly drove herself to the shoot in her Range Rover. Afterwards, they enjoyed a lunch with other members of the royal family including the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Edward, Sophie the Countess of Wessex and their children, Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.

The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s friend Lindsay Roth asked her to take on the important role for her wedding back in 2016.  But Meghan was a bit nervous about one of her maid-of-honour duties - organising the hen party , or the bachelorette party.  She didn\u0027t like the idea of running around a city trying to get into clubs and wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion. So instead, she decided to organise a low-key stagette - and it sounds like it was really lovely.  Meghan organised for the two of them, along with their other pal Lucy, to go on a weekend break to Hydra in Greece.

Exciting, of course, but immense – especially when it came to a bachelorette party.  Because the thought of running around a city trying to get into clubs and wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion didn\u0027t seem very on brand for us, I opted instead to woo the bride to be with a more low-key stagette. Now splitting half her time in London, it was easy for Linds to have a European weekend jaunt – so along with our friend Lucy, we ventured off to the sleepy chic island of Hydra. It\u0027s a two hour ferry from Athens, and a little rock trapped in time with the only mode of transportation being bikes or donkeys.

With infinite options available and the realisation that this is something your little one has to live with forever, it can be a tad overwhelming. So how do you go about making the task a little bit easier?  You could check out the most popular baby names to see if you like any of them, or look at the least popular to see which to avoid.  You could use a random name generator and let fate decide.   Or you could do what some millennial parents are opting to do and choose your baby\u0027s name based on which website domain names are up for grabs.  Yep, that\u0027s actually something parents are doing now.  According to a survey by GoDaddy 20 percent of millennial parents have already created a website for their baby - and of those 79 percent admitted they would change their child\u0027s name based on what domain names were free.   The study was conducted on 1,000 millennial parents, aged between 24 and 38, to discover how kids are being prepared for a life online. GoDaddy then compared the results against a further study of 1,000 Gen X parents aged 39 to 53 to learn more. A whopping 48 percent of millennial parents said they believe it’s important for their child to have an online presence early in life, compared to just 27 percent of Gen X respondents.

The video, which was taken at the Hear Clinic in Oadby, Leicestershire, shows forceps making their way through the ear to retrieve the cotton bud. Hairs and grissle can be seen throughout the ear as the foreign object is removed.  Neel Raithatha, who’s nicknamed “the wax whisperer”, completed the procedure in a matter of seconds.   He said: “The client reported muffled hearing in the left ear. They informed me that they previously got a cotton bud stuck inside their ear canal 10 years ago but believe it had fallen out by itself. However, more recently, they have been experiencing earache and pressure in the ear. “The cotton bud was deep in the external auditory canal.  Using crocodile forceps, I gently prised it away. “Fortunately, the eardrum was healthy and intact. Mr Raithatha said he’s no stranger to removing bizarre objects from ears.

We can all appreciate and imagine just how unpleasant working in a hospital may be at times.   While busy saving lives, doctors and nurses must see some things that will stay with them forever - and they can\u0027t all be pretty.  This has been highlighted by a medical student, known as Abhishark, who has revealed the gruesome details of his \u0027worst shift ever\u0027.  His shift was pretty bad from the get-go, with his first patient, Buck not being a big fan of showering. Buck, a man in his 70s, was a diabetic who had been suffering with pain in his foot.  In a post on Bored Panda , Abhishark said: He was a large man and was not fond of showering, so much so that there was a flourishing micro-ecosystem under his panus .  Normally I am not one to judge, but his odor was to the point that nursing refused to go in. It was as if opening his folds unearthed an evil that covered the land.  However, Buck loved himself and his life and was proud of his lack of basic human hygiene he even joked that he would use his odor to deter any chores delegated to him from his wife and daughters. After joking about his hygiene, Buck revealed the real reason he had been admitted to the hospital - his left leg had shrivelled and turned black. Abhishark explained: Even though he had his foot wrapped, it was obvious that his leg from the knee down had severe gangrene. Buck recalled that he had foot pain two months ago and as time went on it got worse and then it got better.  He only came in today at the request of his wife, whom I was still not completely convinced existed. And here\u0027s where things got really gross. As Abhishark removed the bandage around Buck\u0027s foot to take a look at the damage, his little toe fell off. His pinkie toe just popped off. Just like that. Pop. I picked up his toe husk and held it in the air we both looked at each other in silence.

Middle-aged designer Lure Hsu became an internet star because she has the fresh-faced appearance a 20-year-old would be proud of. Instagram users have been mystified about how the Lure, who owns her own self-named clothing line, has maintained wrinkle-free skin into her early 40s. After gaining more than 700,000 followers, she revealed to Taiwan\u0027s Friday magazine the secrets behind her ageless looks, which include a strict diet and regular exercise. The 43-year-old suggested most skin problems could be solved with regular moisturising and has previously showcased brands such as SK-II and La Prairie online.  Lure also says she has been able to maintain her youthful looks while being able to enjoy a little bit of time in the sun, albeit in small doses. She told Friday magazine she does not sit in the sun often because it dries out her skin and can make fine lines show up more harshly.  As well as always putting on sunscreen when stepping outside, Lure also has a daily skincare regime with oral supplements like Vitamin C and collagen. For her strict diet, the internet sensation starts the day with a black coffee without sugar - which she claims wakes up her skin in the morning.

Appearing in an interview in Thailand, the mother described how the teenager was having a fantastic time abroad before the absolute disaster. Speaking from her home in the UK, she said the incident had changed her daughter\u0027s life and freedom and left her even scared to be here. She wants to be out, then when she\u0027s out, she wants to be in, she said. The mum\u0027s comments come as Thai police are investigating the alleged attack, which occurred on Koh Tao earlier this summer.  This afternoon, officers led a press parade at the beach where the girl claims she was raped after being drugged in the early hours of June 26. Police chiefs from Surat Thani province were seen walking along the Sairee Beach where the teenager, from London, was allegedly attacked. It is claimed she was drugged after drinking at a nearby bar. She later awoke with no underwear on, according to reports. She allegedly found a man next to her, who fled the area. The scene is the same place where British backpackers Hannah Witheridge, 23, and 24-year-old David Miller were murdered in 2014.  It was earlier reported that Thai police allegedly took no details when the teenager tried to report the attack to the authorities. However, cops have since claimed she did not make a rape complaint - instead telling them only that her valuables had been stolen. Surat Thani police commander Apichart Boonsriroj said officers would issue a summons for the girl to return to the island and give evidence. But her mum said she wouldn\u0027t let her daughter go back to Thailand. She offered to go instead before the three-month time limit for reporting a crime passes. \u0027\u0027I\u0027m not letting my daughter go back to Thailand, she said. I will go back, I\u0027ve been in touch with the FCO  and they said they would be happy to meet me and keep me safe.\u0027\u0027  There is a three month time limit in which to file a police complaint after the date of the alleged crime - giving the teenager until the end of September. According to an earlier report by the Samui Times, the girl handed a T-shirt containing DNA to British police after returning to the UK in July. And speaking out about the incident, her mother referenced the top. She said: \u0027\u0027This was a disaster, an absolute disaster. It\u0027s changed her life, it\u0027s changed her freedom, she\u0027s even scared to be here. She wants to be out, then when she\u0027s out, she wants to be in. \u0027\u0027The [British] police have the t-shirt so what more evidence is there? This is the trouble, it\u0027s her word against them, the whole of the police force of Koh Tao and Koh Phangan. \u0027\u0027The British Embassy is in touch with me, their hands are tied too, aren\u0027t they? Nobody really knows what to do because it\u0027s so dark.  The girl has so far not made a complaint of rape to Thai police, only reporting the theft of an iPhone 7, 3,000 baht in cash and debit cards. She is said to have left Koh Tao on the day of the alleged attack to visit neighbouring Koh Phangan. She allegedly did not want to return to the infamous island to make a complaint of rape. A male friend went instead and was allegedly told that CCTV at the bar where the teenager claims to have been drugged were not working. Pol Maj Gen Boonsriroj said the alleged rape occurred at 1.30am in a location that police found was crowded at the time. He said: \u0027\u0027Police patrolled the area at 3am the same morning and seven surveillance cameras within a 300-metre radius of the location on Sairee beach remained functional. \u0027\u0027The female tourist did not make a rape complaint. She told the hostel owner who advised her to contact the police.

The boys need to start taking chances.“The fans have been brilliant to me in my time here as a player and as a manager.“Yeah, when things aren’t going well they are going to shout and show their disappointment and I get that because I am disappointed for my team.”What frustrated the manager most was the dominance his team showed in the first half in particular. They didn’t make the most of that, however, as the home side rode out the storm and then took their chance when it came.Neil added: “It’s so frustrating. I thought we totally dominated the first half bar the five-minute spell that St Johnstone had.“It’s another one of those where you feel you’ve played really well, particularly in the first half, and it’s a sore one to take.“Sofien Moussa has a great chance with a header.

The acceleration up amplifies the spin in the air which can lead to a ‘funnel cloud’ developing.“When it extends all the way down to the ground it becomes a tornado.“Funnel clouds and tornadoes can happen anywhere, even in Dundee, though coastal areas are slightly more favoured because of the iation in air movements over the sea.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-create-thousands-of-apprenticeships","story":"                          MCDONALD\u0026rsquoS has pledged to create 43,000 apprenticeships across Europe by 2025, including a substantial number in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"popes-visit-an-opportunity-to-end-the-cover-ups","story":"                          THE Pope\u0027 visit to Ireland is an opportunity to end the cover-up of abuse, Sinn Fein\u0027 vice-president said."},{"url":null,"title":"community-officer-confiscates-mans-frosty-jacks-before-pouring-it-into-a-bin","story":"                          A PCSO has been branded a \"bully\" for confiscating a man\u0027 sealed bottle of cider and pouring it in a bin -

I am sure other councils in Scotland and further afield will be interested in seeing how this unique approach develops.”Participants have been identified through an assessment process and were chosen because it is expected they will benefit from an alternative curriculum to ensure they develop the skills for learning, life and work which they might not otherwise achieve.The project aims to deliver a curriculum through which students will be encouraged to celebrate their own achievements and develop as independent, responsible and creative young people.Nat Porter, the community liaison officer for Peterhead FC, said: “This is exciting for us in a number of ways.“It is an excellent opportunity to work with the partners to find a new way of supporting local young people and shows what can be achieved when we all have the same ambition.“It is also the first time we have worked together with Aberdeen FC.

She said: “There’s always going to be nostalgia for the place.“Our project co-ordinator has been here for a long time, we’ve got a member of staff who’s been here for 20 years, so it’s part of their life. I’d imagine it’ll be emotional.”The nursery moved from Logie Place into purpose-built premises within the Hub, on Manor Avenue, in January last year.According to Marie, the move has dramatically improved the quality of the nursery, with more children being able to attend, increasing the catchment area they can serve.Marie said: “Before, we could only serve Middlefield, but now we can take children from Heathryfold, Cummings Park, Marchburn and other places in the local area, so more people are really seeing the benefits.”The new facility has also improved the quality of care, she added.“It’s greatly improved the facilities that we have – it’s a purpose-built nursery and the space we have is much bigger, and it’s much more open plan,” Marie said.“We have better access to the outdoors – the doors open up into the nursery garden, which was always our vision, to give the children a choice.”Transport Scotland announced that the demolition will take place between 1.30 and 2pm on Monday.A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland is pleased to accommodate the request of Middlefield Community Project Nursery for the opportunity to visit the site during demolition of their former premises, which are part of the ongoing works being carried out in preparation for the A90/A96 Haudagain Improvement Project.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east nursery staff praised by inspectors","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from a north-east nursery are welcoming and caring towards children, inspectors said.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Lairhillock School Nursery in Netherley on June 13 and have now published their report.The nursery provides day care for up to 30 children aged between three and five.Inspectors rated it “good” for care, support, management and leadership– the third best of six possible ratings.“Staff were welcoming and caring towards children and families and as a result had built positive relationships,” said the report.It added: “Staff knew the needs of the children well and were able to discuss children’s different personality traits and learning needs.”During the visit, inspectors saw children playing outside.Their report said: “Children enjoyed running around in the fresh air, digging holes in the mud garden and exploring the climbing frame.“This helped keep the children active and healthy.“Staff were well supported by the head teacher.“All parents commented on how approachable and nice staff were and they were confident about who to go to if they had a query or a concern.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/countesswells.jpg ","title":"public urged to join the hunt for wildlife at aberdeen development","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents are being invited to help hunt for wildlife at an Aberdeen housing development this weekend.The hunt is part of a Bio-Blitz event being organised by Countesswells Development Limited. 100vw, 641px\" /People of all ages are being urged to take part in the event this Sunday, which will begin at Cults Burn Park.North-East Scotland Biodiversity Partnership  is working in conjunction with the firm to help people hunt for tiger and elephant moths.Ewen Cameron, chairman of the NESPB’s awareness and involvement group, said the event promises to be a fascinating and fun day.He said: “One of the special features of Countesswells is the green space that runs through and around the houses.

She said: “I took up post just over a year ago, and I knew that it was a question that had to be asked.“We did a fairly extensive consultation on it, with pupils, staff, parents and carers.“The very first step was asking, ‘should we have a uniform or not?’“It was a very conclusive yes.”The pupil council at the school took a leading role in the decision-making process, according to Ms Reid.They asked for the school to give them two options, and they would hold a school-wide vote to decide what would be chosen.According to the head teacher, there hasn’t been any push back from pupils on the decision.She said: “Given how much we consulted them over the course of last year, we got all that done and dusted before the start of this year.“All the conversations that we had with pupils and parents are in the past now, and the consensus was that they were ready to go when we came back.“So far, we’ve had pretty much 100% in uniform.”S6 pupil Shaan Singh was originally against the idea.He said: “I did say that I didn’t want it, but after wearing it, I feel like it’s better.“Previously I was at another school where we did have to wear a uniform and I wasn’t a big fan of it.“When I came here we were given a bit more freedom, and I didn’t want that to be taken away, but I’ve come around to the idea.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"union strike action on total rigs suspended pending talks","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWorkers union Unite has confirmed today that it will suspend planned industrial action on three North Sea rigs operated by French oil giant Total.The strike action, planned for the September 3, is to be halted pending talks with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  concerning the dispute on Friday.Workers were due to down tools next week as part of a series of work stoppages that have taken place on the on the Alwyn, Dunbar and Elgin platforms.But as negotiations between the workers union and Total broke down last week, arbitration group ACAS has been called in.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/08/18, 1:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Well done to young Ella Pollock for recognising that she can make a difference.Something as simple as baking cakes can be all it takes to make another\u0026#8217s life a little better.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK  urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"junior championship at lochgilphead golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/08/18, 6:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe juniors took to the course last Thursday and Friday August 9 and 10 to compete for the coveted title of Junior Champion for 2018.Day one saw Ruan McKellar finish with a fantastic gross 92, giving him an eight shot lead over his brother Kern.

Consistency, however, paid off for Inveraray as they were crowned Grade 1 Champion of Champions across all five major competitions during 2018 \u0026#8211 for the third year running.In Grade 4B, a young Mid Argyll Pipe Band kept up the momentum started in May when they won the British title. Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang, they performed tremendously well all season. A fourth place finish in the world championship ensured Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the Grade 4 Champion of Champions title for 2018.Early excitement for the Mid Argyll drum corps \u0026#8211 when they were awarded the drumming Champion of Champions crown \u0026#8211 turned to disappointment by the beginning of this week when the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association amended the result. The Mid Argyll drummers were tied on points with Lower Clyde Pipes and Drums across the season but the fact Lower Clyde got a better result on the day put them just ahead, leading to confusion.Craig Lang said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been a historic season for the band, being crowned British champions in May, then going on to win Champion of Champions on Saturday, an unbelievable achievement for such a young group.\u0026#8216Myself and lead drummer Graeme McMillan are immensely proud of every member. The work they have put in over last year has been admirable and  we hope we have given Mid Argyll a band to be proud of.\u0026#8217Pipe Major Stuart Liddell of Inveraray and District was pleased with his band\u0026#8217s result, commenting: \u0026#8216It has been another fantastic season for the band \u0026#8211 having been second in four of the five championships, winning the Europeans in Forres and securing the Champion of Champions for the third consecutive year.\u0026#8216The competition this year has been of a very high level and has been interesting to see four different bands lift titles \u0026#8211 Scottish Power , St Lawrence O\u0026#8217Toole from Ireland , ourselves  and Field Marshall Montgomery \u0026#8211 who have just been crowned the world champions for the 12th time under Pipe Major Richard Parkes, equalling the record set by the legendary Pipe Major Ian McLellan of Strathclyde Police.\u0026#8216It is great to be included amongst these great bands and the consistency is reflective of all the hard work that goes into it.\u0026#8217Elsewhere, in Novice A, Oban High School came second behind Dollar Academy.Kintyre Schools came an excellent fifth in a Novice B competition featuring 19 bands from across the globe.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"youth shinty takes macaulay centre stage","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/08/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPrior to the senior shinty Macaulay Cup Final on Saturday August 18, three Argyll and Bute district teams contested a round-robin tournament at the nearby rugby club.The tournament featured S1 teams representing Oban/Ballachulish, Mid Argyll and Cowal and Bute.Mid Argyll were up first against the Oban area team.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe.

Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out . It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7  are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tradition-to-the-fore-as-ali-mcculloch-trio-arrive-in-selkirk","story":"ONE of Scotland\u0027s most exciting traditional music trios is heading for Selkirk.\nThe Alistair McCulloch Trio will perform at The Haining on Wednesday, August 29.\nAnd prior to tuning up for the toe-tapping evening, lead fiddler Ali will host a one-hour workshop for intermediate level players.\nThe performance and tuition session in Selkirk has been organised by local group, Riddell Fiddles.\nThe trio - which also includes Aaron Jones of Old Blind Dogs and the Kate Rusby?

Borders residents has been handed into Scottish Borders Council, urging the authority to employ officers with a specific remit to assist benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade them to hire more people in the future to help people with filling in of forms and other admin.\n\u0026ldquoThe welfare benefits service was a much loved service which really helped people and the changes were made with no consultation whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling for them to consult with people who claim welfare benefits as to what is needed.\nCouncillors sitting on the Scottish

prepared for ongoing welfare reform including the rollout of universal credit.\n\u0026ldquoThe Department for Work and Pensions expectation on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were employed to assist with basic benefit enquiries including form

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats Protection.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter school governance reform","story":"Deputy first minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch,Longniddry.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"nurserys outdoor play recognised","story":"Play More was set up to help deserving nurseries improve their outdoor play areas with financial support or murals.It is an initiative which was set up by nappy cream manufacturers Sudocrem to encourage parents and children to get back in touch with nature and explore the greatest playground on earth- the outdoors.As part of the campaign a survey asked 200 children, between the ages of four to eight-years-old, to identify some of the creepy crawlies in Britain.The survey revealed that nine out of 10 children were unable to recognise a butterfly even though there is an abundance of native British insects, with around 27,000 insect species calling the UK home.Moreover, 51 per cent did not know what a Bumblebee looks like.

She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals .  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent .  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions  said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening.

Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level. It is an honour that we have been shortlisted as one of eight finalists in this category."},{"url":null,"title":"aberlady-street-to-be-without-power-for-most-of-the-day","story":"  Scottish Power is carrying out work on the village\u0026rsquos Kirk Road, with work to take place until 6pm.

She also announced Britain\u0026rsquos first post-Brexit trade pact, with the Government intending to carry over the EU\u0026rsquos economic partnership agreement with Mozambique and the Southern African Customs Union , which consists of South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland.

She said: \u0026ldquoToday we are stepping up our partnership with Nigerian authorities to find traffickers and bring them to justice.  \u0026ldquoAnd because this is an international problem which needs international response, we are also launching a new project with France to strengthen border cooperation to prevent trafficking along key migration routes towards Libya and Europe.  \u0026ldquoBut as well as targeting the smugglers and traffickers that cruelly exploit people for financial gain, it\u0026rsquos vital that we support the victims who have suffered enormous trauma and are at high risk of being re-trafficked, and that is an important part of the support we are announcing today.

Based on these figures, the Children\u0026rsquos Society estimates that nearly 110,000 children aged 14 may have self-harmed across the UK during the same 12-month period, including 76,000 girls and 33,000 boys.  One young person told the charity: \u0026ldquoI felt like self-harming was what I wanted to do and had to do as there was nothing else I could do. I think there is help for young people but not the right kind of help.  \u0026ldquoFeeling not pretty enough or good enough as other girls did contribute towards my self-harming, however, I don\u0026rsquot feel just being a girl is the reason as I think boys feel the same way too.  Almost half of 14-year-olds who said they had been attracted to people of the same gender or both genders said they had self-harmed , analysis revealed.  Children\u0026rsquos Society chief executive Matthew Reed said: \u0026ldquoIt is deeply worrying that so many children are unhappy to the extent that they are self-harming.  \u0026ldquoWorries about how they look are a big issue, especially for girls, but this report shows other factors such as how they feel about their sexuality and gender stereotypes may be linked to their unhappiness.  Mr Reed said that ministers now needed to act.  He said: \u0026ldquoEarly support for vulnerable children and families in the community, which can help prevent mental health problems from developing, is also vital, and ministers must urgently address the \u0026pound2 billion funding shortfall facing council children\u0026rsquos services departments by 2020.  Roy Perry, who chairs the Local Government Association children and young people board, said the figures revealed a \u0026ldquocrisis in children\u0026rsquos mental health.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis is why we are calling for councils and schools to be given the funding to offer independent mental health counselling so pupils have access to support as and when they need it.  \u0026ldquoCouncils across the country work hard to ensure children and young people can access the support they need. However, with children\u0026rsquos services facing a \u0026pound3 billion funding gap by 2025, this is getting increasingly difficult.  \u0026ldquoMany councils are being forced to cut early intervention work, including youth services, which helps children avoid reaching crisis point, perform better at school and avoid mental health issues in later life.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe need to develop a system that says yes, rather than no, to children when they ask for help.  Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , added: \u0026ldquoEducation around issues like appearance, gender stereotypes and sexuality is also desperately needed and should be included in the new relationships and sex education curriculum.  \u0026ldquoThis country\u0026rsquos mental health crisis is not going to go away overnight, but with appropriate action from Government, there is hope that fewer children will have mental health worries and be happier with their life as a result.  The Good Childhood Report draws on the Children\u0026rsquos Society\u0026rsquos annual survey of 10-to-17-year-old children and their parents from 2,000 socio-economically representative households in England, Scotland and Wales.  The report also uses the Millennium Cohort Survey, which follows the lives of 11,144 children born in the UK in 2000-01.

Some 2,000 envelopes with the Freepost address scrawled in the same handwritten block capitals and ink arrived last Wednesday at the Clifton Terrace Lib Dem base.  Mr Cole-Hamilton said: \"We had a bit of a laugh about it at their expense.  \"It must\u0027ve taken them two or three days, but it\u0027s unlikely to cost us a penny.\"  Mr Cole-Hamilton said the Freepost address was \"widely available\", pushed through constituents\u0027 doors on surveys so they can submit them completed to his office.  He added: \"It\u0027s important in a democracy that elected members are accessible and at no cost to yourself and we fundraise to support that.\"  Mr Cole-Hamilton\u0027s staff started opening the envelopes to find nothing inside and immediately twigged to the ruse.

He said: \"Clearly this was designed to target us, to drain our resources, but what they didn\u0027t know is that the Royal Mail might refund malicious misuse of postal addresses, as they may do in this case.  \"To spend that amount of time on something like this is a bit of a worry.

Mrs May made an \"unashamed\" vow to ensure the aid programme works for the UK, explaining: \"Today I am committing that our development spending will not only combat extreme poverty, but at the same time tackle global challenges and support our own national interest.  \"This will ensure that our investment in aid benefits us all, and is fully aligned with our wider national security priorities.\"  Her visit is the first by a British PM to sub-Saharan Africa in five years.

Dr Allan Perkins, senior conservation scientist at RSPB Scotland and the study\u0026rsquos lead author, said: \u0026ldquoLack of food has been the biggest pressure for these birds and shows just how vulnerable our seabirds and marine life are.  \u0026ldquoAs sandeel numbers have declined around these key north east areas in Scotland the whole food chain is impacted. If these sharp declines continue, it\u0026rsquos possible that Arctic skuas will be lost as a breeding species in Scotland.  Arctic skuas are medium sized seabirds with pointed falcon-like wings and long, pointed tail feathers.  The colonies studied hold around a third of the UK\u0026rsquos breeding population, all of which are found in Scotland.

But don\u0026rsquot expect to make friends with a goat if you scowl at it.  Scientists showed 20 goats unfamiliar photos of the same human face looking happy or angry.  The research, conducted at Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats in Kent, demonstrated that the goats preferred to interact with the smiling face.  Released from a distance of four metres  they generally made straight for the happy image, exploring it curiously with their snouts.  This suggested that goats use the left hemisphere of their brains to process positive emotion, said the team from Queen Mary, University of London.  Dr Alan McElligott, who led the research, said: \u0026ldquoThe study has important implications for how we interact with livestock and other species, because the abilities of animals to perceive human emotions might be widespread and not just limited to pets.  Goats were already known to be sensitive to human body language, but the new findings show they also respond to emotional facial expressions.  Co-author Dr Christian Nawroth, a member of the Queen Mary team now based at the Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology in Germany, said: \u0026ldquoHere we show for the first time that goats do not only distinguish between these expressions, but they also prefer to interact with happy ones.  Other studies have shown that dogs and horses also appear to recognise and remember human facial expressions displaying emotion.  Sheep are known to possess a powerful visual memory and an ability to recognise human faces from photographs.  Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the researchers concluded: \u0026ldquoThese findings suggest that the ability of animals to perceive human facial cues is not limited to those with a long history of domestication as companions, and therefore may be far more widespread than previously believed."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-theresa-may-in-africa","story":"              Prime Minister Theresa May has begun a three-day trade mission to Africa."},{"url":null,"title":"dup-and-sinn-fein-blame-each-other-as-powersharing-impasse-milestone-reached","story":"  Tuesday marked 589 days since the Democratic Unionist and Sinn Fein-led powersharing executive collapsed \u0026ndash passing Belgium for the world\u0026rsquos longest peacetime period without a properly functioning government.  While Northern Ireland will avoid an embarrassing entry in the Guinness Book of World Records \u0026ndash the Stormont stalemate was ruled ineligible as it only relates to a devolved administration \u0026ndash angry members of the public organised a series of public protests to mark the day.  The #wedeservebetter events were arranged for more than a dozen cities and towns across the region on Tuesday evening, though organisers were forced to cancel the main rally outside City Hall at late notice due to a major fire at a nearby shop.  The executive imploded in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein over a botched renewable energy scheme.  The rift widened to take in other more tradition disputes \u0026ndash such as the Irish language \u0026ndash and the parties remain at loggerheads, with no prospect of an imminent breakthrough on the horizon.  While there has been speculation over a new round of negotiations for the autumn, no date has publicly been announced.

The area is not commonly visited by dolphins and Kylie has mostly been exposed to sounds produced by other species, particularly the harbour porpoise.  University of Strathclyde PhD research student Mel Cosentino has been studying underwater audio recordings and found the dolphin has\u0026nbsplearned to increase the frequency of the clicking sounds made to navigate and hunt to match the porpoises.  Common dolphins have peak frequencies below 100 kilohertz  while for harbour porpoises it is around 130KHz.  Recordings made by volunteers from the Clyde Porpoise group using two towed underwater microphones found Kylie now regularly produces clicks with peak frequencies reaching over 130KHz when accompanied by harbour porpoises.  Ms Cosentino said: \u0026ldquoSeveral cetacean species, such as bottlenose dolphins, belugas and killer whales, have the ability to change their acoustic repertoire as a result of interactions with other species.  \u0026ldquoThis vocal learning ability has mainly been observed in captive individuals and few cases have been reported for wild cetaceans.

Imelda made an impression with her cherry and white chocolate oatmeal biscuits in the first round, but she struggled in the technical challenge, coming in 11th place.  Her final bake, for which she constructed her own face in biscuit against a seaside backdrop, was critiqued as \u0026ldquoquite simple and \u0026ldquoa little bland, and dry by Leith.  Hollywood said he could not detect her flavours of lemon and ginger, and compared the overall bake to a \u0026ldquostale shortbread.

An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month. Over a four-week period and 63 cows, this will result in 11 tonnes less of fodder supplies used. While, focus farmer Jim Gammie reported success using woodchips over the last two years, which he is also composting for further land use.Those interested in finding out more or getting involved in a focus group, are invited to get in touch with Declan or Robert on 01467 623 838 or farmprofit@anmgroup, or by stopping by the Farm Profit Programme office located in the concourse at Thainstone Centre.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.                                                    He also suggested that supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed in order to keep prices down.                                                    Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.                                                                                                        He said: “The vast majority of output is supplied south of the border to national supermarkets who value the quality of Scottish produce.“A fully integrated UK market is essential to Scottish farming. This year more than any other shows how important food security is and the opportunity for Scottish growers to displace imports.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"strong prices at thainstone collective sale","story":"        Over 2,000 buyers and sellers attended the latest collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment at Thainstone.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 2:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 2:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation. We have had great support from the community and are committed to Thurso and Caithness.Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AMTE Power, said: \u0026ldquoThe combination of world-leading British innovation from QinetiQ coupled with the manufacturing capability of AMTE allows customers access to new and exciting energy storage options, giving them a choice beyond the existing supply chain.\u0026ldquoThe new products will see step change in capability and alternative options for our technology customers.Mike Sewart of QinetiQ said: \u0026ldquoWe recognise that our strengths lie in research, prototyping and scale-up of cutting-edge battery technology and not in large-scale manufacturing. This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 2:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 29 Aug 2018 2:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

For an entry form, please go to www.rewdt.org. Alternatively, entry forms can be picked up in Trek and Travel and Cycle Orkney in Kirkwall, or entrants can also come along on the day and register before the race.This year’s lap will once again start at the pier and the race will be anti-clockwise around the island, finishing by Trumland House.Another run and walk is set to be held in Westray, with the biannual Bisgeos 12-mile run/walk.The 12-mile run/walk starts from Rapness Terminal at 10am, while a one-mile run and walk will take place from Quoys, Westside from 11am.

Alex Salmond has formally begun his legal action against the Scottish Government over its handling of sexual harassment allegations made against him.                Two complaints were raised in January against the former first minister, who strongly denies the allegations, and he was informed of an investigation in March.            Mr Salmond is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him.            His petition for a judicial review has now been lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, court officials confirmed on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Mr Salmond has written to Scotland’s top civil servant, calling for an inquiry into how the allegations against him were made public.He contacted Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans on Monday urging her to investigate.Read more: Alex Salmond demands full inquiry into harassment ‘leak’ in government letterThe former first minister said someone within the Scottish Government has “flagrantly and repeatedly” breached the confidential complaints process by leaking details to the Daily Record newspaper.            The Government previously said its investigation into the two complaints has been “entirely confidential throughout”.A statement released on Mr Salmond’s behalf said: “It is manifestly absurd for the Permanent Secretary to claim that her procedure is ‘confidential’ when it is splashed over the front pages, emanating from briefings to a single newspaper.“As explained many times now, confidentiality on such matters is crucial to both complainers and those complained about.“Without it those who wish to make a complaint can have no confidence in the system protecting them while those complained about are denied fairness.            “Someone within the Scottish Government has flagrantly, and repeatedly, breached that requirement and the Permanent Secretary is now required to try and find out who it was.”The allegations about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, first emerged on Thursday when the former MP released a statement prompted by an inquiry from the Daily Record.The newspaper published what it claimed were details of one of the complaints over the weekend.Police Scotland confirmed on Friday that the complaints have been passed to the force.Opposition parties have called for “full transparency” from the Government over its investigation.            A spokesman said: “For legal reasons we are unable to provide further detail at this time.“However, in the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.”The PCS, Prospect and the FDA issued a joint statement saying: “Civil service unions met with the Permanent Secretary today and have confidence that the Scottish Government will continue to take seriously and handle sensitively all complaints of harassment.“The unions are confident that the Scottish Government processes which we negotiated are valid and robust and if any member wishes to make a complaint then they will receive the full support of their trade union.“We also indicated our full support to the Permanent Secretary personally in leading the process and would encourage any worker with any concerns to come forward. ”Read more: Alex Salmond: ‘dirty tricks’ conspiracy theories run wild amid allegations"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778381.1535382019!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh fringe 106 of the best ever jokes and one liners","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The species, which has its UK stronghold in the far north of the country, has been suffering major declines over recent decades.            The latest figures suggest numbers have crashed by more than 80 per cent in the past 20 years.            As part of the new study, researchers from the RSPB’s Centre for Conservation Science analysed data between 1992 and 2015 from 33 Scottish Arctic skua colonies. These colonies, in Orkney, Shetland and Handa, hold around a third of the UK’s entire breeding population of Arctic skuas.The scientists found the main driver of the decline is a huge drop in breeding success.They believe this has been caused by a reduction in the amount of food – particularly sandeels – available to the birds during their crucial breeding season. Dr Allan Perkins, senior conservation scientist at RSPB Scotland and the study leader, said: “We have known for many years that Arctic skuas numbers have been going down in Scotland but this study reveals just how bad the declines have been at some of their most important breeding sites.             “Lack of food has been the biggest pressure for these birds and shows just how vulnerable our seabirds and marine life are as sandeel numbers have declined around these key north-east areas in Scotland the whole food chain is impacted. “If these sharp declines continue, it’s possible that Arctic skuas will be lost as a breeding species in Scotland.”Arctic skuas are medium-sized seabirds with pointed falcon-like wings and long pointed tail feathers. They are rare breeding birds in the UK, and are on the red list for species of conservation concern.Arctic skuas are known as the pirates of the seabird world because they steal food from other species – a behaviour called kleptoparasitism."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790486.1535384241!/image/image.jpg","title":"fueltone sees turnover rise 20","story":"        An Aberdeen-based fuel additives company has reported a 20 per cent leap in turnover in the past 12 months thanks to product expansion and a strategic trading partnership.                Fueltone, which provides fuel additives and engine treatments for domestic and commercial vehicles, has reported a year-on-year turnover increase from £570,000 to £684,000 for the year ended 31 July.            The company has grown its range during the period to provide products for both petrol and diesel cars and vans, as well as a specialist product for motorcycles, all of which are supported by the Scottish Motor Trade Association.            It has also introduced its offering to a wider audience by entering new markets, such as fleet and commercial vehicles, agricultural and plant vehicles, and equipment.Over the past year the firm has added 150 new stockists, bringing the total to some 450 locations in the UK. The company plans to develop an online selling function and is currently undertaking trials in international markets aimed at the heavy goods and general logistics markets.Charlene O’Conner, chief executive of Fueltone, said: “Our strategy to introduce a new product range into a busy and competitive market was a brave choice but by differentiating and leading with innovation and quality we have been a disruptive force amongst the market leaders in the UK. “It has taken time and investment but these actions are now bearing fruit.            “As brand awareness continues to grow we are bringing forward e-commerce functionality on our website but, uniquely, we will drive the fulfilment of that business into our distribution chain. “That way our loyal stockists will also benefit from our efforts to capture a higher proportion of online business.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790585.1535393607!/image/image.jpg","title":"aidan smith the end is in sight for reality tv","story":"        There are signs that we have finally, finally had enough of the narcissistic rubbish known as reality TV, writes Aidan Smith.                Rock star, messianic man-in-tights, comedy-moustache camp commandant, Freddie Mercury was also a great seer, able to predict the future. Consider these lyrics, which he warbled way back in 1975: “Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality ... ”            Was that not Freddie anticipating the dread dawn of reality television? Has there not been a landslide of “real people” turning up uninvited in our parlours, a tsunami of ordinary folk keen to display their navel fluff and more besides on primetime? And hasn’t it felt like there’s no escape, that the fly-on-the-wall phenomenon would move inexorably to its inevitable conclusion – a programme with hidden cameras following the progress of flies on a wall, each of them adopted by carefully selected members of the great unwashed – except there will be no conclusion, for reality TV won’t end, ever?            Well, it just might, you know. The big beasts of reality are ailing. Small-screen juggernauts once thought to be impregnable and untouchable are creaking. There’s been a chain reaction of misfortune and mild calamity, as if each has been feeling the other’s pain, as if they might all perish together in some bizarre suicide pact. It’s a nice thought, yes?Strictly speaking, Strictly Come Dancing is celebrity-based, although you could have fooled the headline writer who with obvious exasperation asked the other day: “Is this the most obscure line-up ever?” The show returns next month and there’s a feeling it is overdoing diversity at the expense of glitter. Maybe good intentions have taken Strictly down this route. Or it could be arrogance. Berserk on power, the producers’ summoning a BBC3 documentary-maker, a video blogger and Lee from pop berks Blue – among others even less well-known – might be an act of willful perversity, bolstered by the belief the bovine masses will tune in regardless. We’ll see ...READ MORE: Notable reality TV appearances by politiciansThe X Factor comes back on Saturday. You thought it died a long, long time ago, to quote David Bowie this time? Nope, the man who sold the world, Simon Cowell, is still flogging his karaoke klamjamphrie. The programme has finally caught up with its crazed and capricious emperor’s fashion sense, and is now as hopelessly out of date as those flared stonewashed jeans. It’s tried everything to stop the viewing figures falling off a cliff, apart from a Cliff Richard theme night, that is. It’s tried auditions with audiences and without, Cowell present and  not present, freakshow and theatre of cruelty. If new judge Robbie Williams can’t save The X Factor, surely Cowell will proffer the downward-pointing thumb to the whole sad affair.Later this year I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! will attempt to carry on without its chief ant. Here’s a presenter – Ant McPartlin – who because of his well-publicised personal problems really needs a break from the show. Well, don’t we all? But the reality behemoth most vulnerable right now is Big Brother. At the Edinburgh TV Festival the other day, Channel 5 director of programmes Ben Frow admitted the end was nigh for the programme. “I plan for a year without Big Brother,” he said. “A lot of our very successful shows have started to decline, which is life.”            Life. That’s what BB was supposed to be: ordinary life in extraordinary surroundings, ordinary people in a ground-breaking social experiment, and for a while we fell for that tagline and were hooked. The early years were weirdly hypnotic. Who knew watching folk doing next to nothing could be so much fun? Maybe we were fed up with scripted, and often overwrought, dramas on TV – and actresses who claimed to still be 29 plugging them remorselessly on daytime chat-shows. Reality TV seemed to be democratising the goggle-box. Well, it just goes to show: not all democracy is good.READ MORE: Real Housewives ‘Queen’ tells all about reality TV seriesVery soon the contestants became aware of the cameras and what they could do for their ordinary lives. If they felt like laboratory beagles, required to undergo smoking tests, then they quickly turned the tables on the producers and lit up fat cigars for themselves. Fame could be theirs! It changed the nature of the show completely, and Big Brother changed telly completely.Suddenly, everyone was on TV, or everyone could be. Every profession, every office, could be the setting for a six-part series and many were. Big Brother was brought to our screens by Peter Bazalgette, a telly impresario whose great-great-grandfather laid London’s sewage network. Inevitably some latterday drainage workers got their own docusoap. What was it called again? Sludge? C**p? Plumbing the Depths? Real dramas were cancelled, actors found themselves out of work.            These shows were all the children, or bastard offspring, of Big Brother and it will take some time before they’re all sluiced away because reality still dominates the schedules. We will all have our pet hates. Mine is the property porn of Location, Location, Location and especially the moment when the dull would-be homebuyers are in the local wine bar with presenter Phil Spencer and waiting to find out if their bid has been successful. Is it wrong to view them as acquisitive morons when they probably just want somewhere nice to live? Maybe, but that’s what reality television does to me.All those shows about offices have given us The Office but reality has also begat Katie Hopkins and helped in the creation of this narcissistic age where children, when asked what they want to be when they grow up, reply: “Famous.”Still, the end could be in sight.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

Is anyone else finding it hard to put their head down at night? In this increasingly virtual world, where it’s becoming harder to discern right from wrong and truth from falsehood, I find myself losing sleep just trying to keep hold of something that feels real. Simply committing to one version of reality requires a tremendous leap of faith the algorithms have boxed us into circular and self-validating conversations that we too often confuse with a mythical ‘consensus’.            In these times of irreversible and sweeping change, we turn to leaders who appear just as baffled by it all as we are. Caught haplessly in the headlights of divided public opinion, our representatives have little choice but to dial up the empty rhetoric. From the chaos must come order and the global stage is truly set for a new kind of politics and a new kind of leadership. Which is why we should all be delighted that Steve Bannon has arrived in Europe to share some of his fantastic ideas about flags and walls.            A right-wing populist, widely regarded as the proximate cause of Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 Presidential race, Bannon, a self-styled economic nationalist and student of political history – who counts Mussolini as one of its most “fascinating” figures – may well be the 21st century’s most audacious man. Entering a chaotic and unfocused campaign just 88 days before its climax, Bannon skilfully steered a floundering Donald Trump through a hurricane of self-generated calamity – including a tape-recorded admission to sexual assault – that threatened to derail his presidential bid. Bannon went on to serve as White House Chief Strategist in the administration during the first seven months of Trump’s term, before leaving the West Wing to play a more decisive and, arguably, dangerous role – as the political Rorschach of our time.READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Beware your inner Trump, the monster inside us allMore so than Trump, Bannon embodies the American Dream. Hailing from a working class, pro-democrat, Catholic household, Bannon defied the gravity of his roots, ascending the ranks of academia where he earned qualifications in urban planning and national security studies , before graduating from Hard Business School as a Master of Business Administration. His subsequent career has spanned every prestigious domain of American society from Wall Street to Hollywood and later journalism and media before finally hanging his feathered cap on the shaky nail of politics. Now in political exile, Bannon is repositioning himself as the architect  of what he calls the “global populist movement”.For some, Bannon is the bitter palette cleanser that precedes the main course of fascism a charge he laughs off as proof his detractors in the “propaganda wing of the establishment” are resorting to smears “because they don’t want to talk about facts”. Others regard him as a natural and necessary disruption to the regularly scheduled neoliberal programming, observing his rise with great interest, arguably ambivalent to the consequences of his radioactive politics. But most worryingly, increasing numbers across the West regard Bannon  as a virtuous, straight-talking tribune of the little-guy. And it’s in this area that his working-class roots appear to be giving him a distinct and devastating advantage.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Boris Johnson’s sinister ties to alt-right guru Steve Bannon            If you watch Bannon speak  he sounds like a class-warrior of old, with constant and deliberate emphasis on “workers” and “elites”. His carefully rehearsed rhetoric is more Chomsky than Trump, with calls for an end to foreign invasions, his assertion that mainstream media is largely a propaganda operation and that criminal charges should be brought against the high-priests of finance who presided over the near-collapse of the Western economic system just a decade ago. Like many on the hard left, Bannon also believes in a high rate of taxation for the wealthy and argued for a 45 per cent rate on anyone making more than five million dollars, before Trump pulled rank. And Bannon, like so many on the left, is utterly merciless in his assessment that the political centre is no more than a puppet theatre for the pampered “parties of Davos”. It’s frightening how hard-right figures like this have been able to co-opt the language of class struggle while our social-democratic systems managers flounder from one cock-up to the next, completely oblivious to what gives this ascendant, virulent strain of right-wing populism its muscularity and momentum. That’s not to cast centre-ground parties as bogey men, or pretend that we’ve seen no progress during the neoliberal period, but if Bannon’s continued rise tells us one thing, it’s that we’ve reached peak ‘easy-does-it’ where our politics and economy are concerned and that liberals, largely insulated from the economic insecurity that gives rise to populism, won’t be enough to stop this march to the far-right.Every trick in the liberal playbook has so far failed. Unlike Trump, May and the rest, Bannon is almost impervious to mockery the merciless, unending social media-driven onslaughts that have derailed and demystified the power and privilege of so many notable figures of late seems to ricochet off Bannon like rubber bullets. Mainstream media scrutiny doesn’t appear to be achieving anything but promoting him, as he smiles through every ‘tough’ question with a palpable lack of concern for whatever liberal hacks try to pin on him. Unlike the coterie of useful idiots that were used as battering rams to clear the brush for Trump’s ominous arrival, Bannon’s star grows brighter by the day, while alt-right poster-boy Milo Yiannopoulos and demented conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as well as Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen among others, have been systematically delegitimised and side-lined. Meanwhile, Bannon has managed to peel-away from the Land of Oz that he, himself, created and may stand as the only serious sideshow to emerge from the political and economic circus of Trumpism.            Unsurprisingly, the fact Bannon comes from humbler beginnings than many of his media and political contemporaries has been largely edited out of the story. Understandably, we tend to focus on his Wall Street connections, his Breitbart ‘news’ site, his fingerprints all over Cambridge Analytica, his courting of the far-right in Europe and the neo-Nazis who – whether Bannon likes it or not – have been empowered by Trump’s hostile rhetoric on illegal immigrants and Muslims.But it’s Bannon’s working-class roots that give him the edge in a political and media climate dominated by people who struggle to both interpret and reflect what is going on further down the food-chain. I suspect the political response to Trumpism – and Bannon – may have to come from the same place."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4776265.1535463548!/image/image.jpg","title":"michael russell scotland and france must maintain auld alliance","story":"        In a speech to a conference in Paris organised by French business organisation Medef, Scottish Government Business and Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell invokes the Auld Alliance, General Charles de Gaulle and other historic links between Scotland and France as he urges the two countries to maintain a good relationship despite \u0026#8220the difficulties being put in our way by those who are looking inwards and backwards\u0026#8221.                I am the member of the Scottish Government responsible for Scotland’s response to Brexit – a policy we didn’t vote for, don’t want and believe will be disastrous.            I am tasked with negotiating with the UK Government, representing our views to the wider world, formulating our strategy going forward and listening to businesses, communities and individuals as they fearfully cast their eyes forward to March 2019 and beyond.              And my job is probably the least envied in Scotland. Of course Scotland and France enjoy close ties which go back centuries – ties of friendship, culture, security, trade and commerce.Voltaire once claimed that Europe looked to Scotland for “all its ideas of civilization” and although that might be an exaggeration we have learnt from each other for a long time. The Scottish Enlightenment was just one of the glittering periods in which we exchanged ideas and influences, many profound and some surprising, like the importation of the French recipe for pink ice cream by one of our most influential philosophers, the great David Hume.Our most famous writers – like Burns, Stevenson and Scott – looked to, were also influenced by and frequently visited France. That continues today with my friend the best-selling thriller writer Peter May now a French citizen with a huge French following.            And MacPherson’s poems of Ossian – the European literary phenomenon of their time – were in Napoleon’s tent on the eve of Waterloo.In an earlier time, we even shared citizenship, and a monarch, for Mary Stuart was Queen of France before she was Queen of Scots and her mother-in-law was the regent of Scotland during a very turbulent period. Our students studied at your universities and we even fought in your wars as mercenaries.READ MORE: Scotland to strengthen ties with EU despite Brexit, says Michael Russell            More peaceably, the French consulate in Edinburgh is the oldest of its kind in Scotland. History is important – but the present day allows all of us to join in. We have living cultural connections. Last year was the Annee de L’Ecosse at Lorient in Brittany. This year, France has made a major contribution to the Edinburgh festivals – for example through the “vive le Fringe” programme at the French Institute.And, of course, our business links are vital. France is Scotland’s third most important export destination. In recent years, you have been our largest European inward investor. French businesses employ more than 20,000 people in Scotland. Scotland benefits hugely from the fact that 10,000 French citizens currently live in Scotland. They contribute hugely to our economy and culture and our society. In the last session of our legislature, one was even an elected member of the Parliament – and for my party. So for all these reasons, it is a pleasure and an honour to speak to all of you today. My basic message is a very simple one. We in Scotland hugely value our relationship with France, and we want it to go from strength to strength. We see collaboration and trade between Scottish and French businesses as a key part of that relationship.             We don’t want to exit [the EU] – we want to intensify our connections. It follows from that, that much of my speech will be very positive. However, Brexit provides a difficult and depressing context to my remarks. And so, almost inevitably, I want to start by addressing that.In 1999 the Scottish Parliament was reconvened for the first time since 1707 – the longest adjournment in history.READ MORE: European scepticism about an independent Scotland gone, says ministerIn its modern incarnation, it was brought to order for the initial session by its oldest member, the great Scottish politician, Winnie Ewing, who was known at home and abroad  as “Madame Ecosse” because of her reputation for fighting tirelessly for Scotland’s interests during her long tenure as a Member of the European Parliament.The Scottish Parliament that exists today has wide powers related to the economy, business, education, health, justice, rural affairs, housing, environment, equal opportunities, culture, transport and taxation.And although we do not yet control all aspects of our lives, given our history and our current activities, no-one disputes that Scotland is a proud European nation.Scotland did not vote for Brexit. We voted to remain inside the European Union by 62 per cent to 38 per cent. Every local authority region in Scotland voted to remain. In 2016 at the time of the European referendum we believed that Brexit would be deeply damaging: we believe that even more strongly now.That judgement is based partly on our shared values. We welcome the opportunities for international co-operation that the EU brings. For us, there’s something highly appealing about the principle of 28 independent countries working together to promote peace and prosperity no matter how hard that can be. It’s also about standards – we have no interest in a race to the bottom on opportunities, the environment or social protection.It’s about the  benefit of free trade and free movement.At it most fundamental, it is about peace and prosperity, prizes hard won in the second half of the 20th century and hard to keep hold of in the 21st.All these things are not to be lightly thrown away in pursuit of a fiction and a fantasy.  And of course, it’s about the economy. As many of you will know, the UK Government last week published the first of three tranches of advice for businesses on what to do in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Among many things, these technical notes highlighted that medicines may need to be stockpiled that all UK exporters are likely to face increased bureaucracy and that for imports, the UK will probably have to unilaterally recognise EU standards anyway.None of those things were amongst the promises made during the EU exit campaign in 2016. All of them testify to the uncertainty and insecurity which now surrounds the process. Those notices also provided the clearest picture yet, of how much we take for granted about our EU membership – and how much we stand to lose. Now, a no-deal Brexit is the worst-possible outcome, of course, and is hopefully still unlikely although the more the UK Government uses it as a stick to frighten the most extreme Brexiteers, the more likely, paradoxically, it becomes.   And the more likely it becomes too if the UK Prime Minister, as she did today, talks about being able to “make a success” of such a disaster. Perhaps this approach is also being used to make the existing proposals from the UK Government look more acceptable – though that is only by comparison with the disaster of a no-deal scenario.  For the new ideas from the UK Government are as unacceptable to Scotland as the old ones.  Our position as a Government on the choice that the UK should make is simple. Our first choice would be not to leave. But the compromise we have repeatedly advocated, recognising that other parts of the UK did vote that way – though they might not in a future ballot if opinion polls are accurate – is one that is still on offer and which has increasing support across our islands.    We believe that if the UK Government is determined to leave the EU, it should at the very least seek to remain a member of the Single Market and the Customs Union, most likely by remaining in the European Economic Area, the EEA, by means of EFTA membership. There is a strong democratic argument for that sort of compromise approach – after all, 48 per cent of those who voted in the 2016 referendum wanted to remain in the EU, including the majority of people in Scotland and Northern Ireland and in London.   There  is also an overwhelming economic argument for this solution. In addition it provides a tailor-made solution to the Irish border issue and it avoids the customs arrangements proposed in the UK Government’s most recent White Paper, which are complex, unprecedented and may well be impossible.The UK Government has repeatedly, of course, ruled out Single Market membership though it has nothing to put in its place. But in contrast the Scottish Government has been consistent in its advocacy of the Single Market and Customs Union position for the last two years and it is a position that now commands wide support in the UK and indeed probably in the UK Parliament as well. We believe that such outcomes would still be achievable – especially with the help, direct or indirect, of European friends such as yourselves. And we believe that this would be the best outcome for Scotland, for the UK as a whole, and indeed for Europe. However, I want to assure you that regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, Scotland will continue to be an outward-looking, open, internationalist country. That means we will continue to take a keen interest in European issues - arguing alongside President Macron for a Europe which addresses effectively the key transnational issues of our age and is of continuing relevance to citizens. And we will continue to encourage trade, inward investment and international collaboration.Scotland benefits hugely from all of those at present – and other countries, businesses and universities benefit from working with us.After all, we have a highly skilled and well-educated workforce  a supportive public sector, and a world-class research base. I am proud to say in this place of learning, and as a former Scottish Education Minister, that Scotland, with five of its 19 universities in the world’s top 200 has more world class universities per head of population than any other country in the world. We also have strengths in key economic sectors from sensor systems and advanced manufacturing to life sciences and business services. That’s why Scotland, in recent years, has become the most successful part of the UK, outside of London, for attracting inward investment. What’s especially striking to me, at this particular conference, is the number of areas in which Scotland’s strengths overlap with areas where France also excels. Food and drink is a long-established example. France is Scotland’s largest European export market for food and drink sales, and French companies such as Pernod \u0026amp Remy Martin are major employers in Scotland, not least in the area I represent in the Scottish Parliament, the whisky-producing islands and coasts of Argyll \u0026amp Bute. France is of course the single largest export market in Europe for that whisky. Your discerning palate , not to say your great thirst, is something for which my constituents remain very grateful. We also share capabilities in much newer sectors. Events such as Vivatech demonstrate how successful France has been, in recent years, at becoming a major centre for technology businesses. Scotland – inevitably on a smaller scale – is also enjoying huge success in that area. Our cities are becoming established as major tech hubs – companies like Skyscanner have been major success stories in recent years. That’s partly because of the quality of our university research. Edinburgh University’s School of Informatics is ranked as the best of its kind in the UK.And the Scottish Government is also promoting new industries such as fintech, and we have invested in The Data Lab – an innovation centre which brings together government, university researchers and businesses.Low-carbon technology is another example. I was very struck last year by your Government’s appeal for climate change scientists to come and work in France. That national ambition – of attracting talent from around the world to work on reducing and mitigating climate change – is one we share in Scotland, where we passed one of the first, and most radical, climate change bills in 2010.  We now generate almost 70 per cent of our gross electricity demand from renewable sources. The waters around Scotland are currently home to the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines, and the world’s largest tidal stream project. In promoting our low-carbon sector, we welcome collaboration with, and investment from, organisations across the globe. These are often multinational partnerships – such as the one involving Norway’s oil company, Equinor, which has invested in the world’s first floating windfarm, now off Scotland’s shores. And your EDF is already a significant investor in Scottish offshore wind projects.Scottish and French researchers and businesses are already working together on important renewable energy projects. For example we participate in EnFait – a research and development project for tidal energy, which is led by Nova Innovation in Scotland, and has important French partners. It’s the sort of collaboration – in a hugely important field of energy research – which is potentially beneficial, not simply to France, Scotland and Europe, but to the wider world. Because Scotland benefits so much from trade and investment – and because we believe we have much to offer to international partners – our response to Brexit is to try to increase, rather than reduce, our connections in Europe and across the globe.We recently launched a major promotional campaign overseas – Scotland is Now.Scottish Development International – our overseas enterprise agency – is doubling the number of people it employs on mainland Europe.We are also opening government offices in key European cities. Our Dublin and Berlin offices have already opened. Our Brussels office has been expanded as has our London presence. And we will formally open a new office in Paris early in the next year – building on the success of SDI’s existing presence there.In doing that, we are making it clear that Scotland remains an open, outward-looking, internationalist country. And we are making it clear how much importance we attach to our friendship with France.We are not exiting – we are staying and expanding. On 23 June 1942 – by coincidence exactly 74 years before the Brexit Referendum – General de Gaulle opened a Free French House in Edinburgh, now the home of the French Consul General.In his speech on that day he said this: “I do not think that a Frenchman could have come to Scotland at any time without being sensible of a special emotion ... awareness of the thousand links, still living and cherished, of the Franco-Scottish Alliance, the oldest alliance in the world, leaps to his mind.”In the midst of this very testing time for Scotland, those links – and that “Auld Alliance” as we call it in Scots – still leap to our minds and we hope to yours. When you look at our existing connections, and when you see how much common ground we share – our passion for excellence our commitment to low-carbon growth our determination to become world leaders in technology the excellence of our universities – then I believe that our relationship will flourish still further in the years ahead despite the difficulties being put in our way by those who are looking inwards and backwards, not outwards and forwards. For all of these reasons, I am delighted to be here today. I hope to see many of you in the future – first of all in Rue d’Anjou when our office in Paris opens. And I look forward to many more years of successful cooperation between our two countries – the ancient, friendly European nations of Scotland and France.Michael Russell is Government Business and Constitutional Relations Secretary"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790579.1535396144!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis no deal brexit plans help politicians be honest","story":"        The UK Government\u0026#8217s publication of its no-deal Brexit plans has set all sides of the debate free to speak their minds, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.                From the easiest trade deal in the world to a promise that you’ll still be able to enjoy a sandwich after Brexit – last week showed the distance we have travelled, and how little there is left to run.            It’s been said that these interesting times have killed off political satire: reality is so much more hilariously unpredictable than anything dreamt up in a writers’ room.            Watching Dominic Raab set out how it was a supreme act of responsibility to publish hundreds of pages of plans for a no-deal scenario that every Brexiteer once said was unthinkable, I had a sudden feeling that the last surviving bit of Brexit humour was being killed off.For those who never heard the Brexit Bulldog sketches on Radio 4, they were a send-up of David Davis’ unshakeable confidence, so his resignation has already put a end to them. But there was delicate balance between realism and absurdity to his promises of securing the best deal in the world before negotiating his way into indentured servitude down a salt mine. It was the unbelievable made just about believeable.Well, here was the Government calmly and responsibly explaining to the nation how life in the salt mine might look, licking the walls for mineral nourishment. Delivered by a perspiring Raab, a man once described as “a baseball bat in a suit”, the humour is gone. Brexit bulldog has been put down.In fact, it feels as if the bulldog spirit has gone out of Brexit altogether. The timing wasn’t his fault, but the new Brexit Secretary delivered his first speech and gave his first press conference on no-deal, something the Government insists won’t happen.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit will lead to Scottish independence, predicts ex-Catalan leader            Ministers will now struggle to credibly return to the sunny optimism of before, and those who were never particularly optimistic have been released from captivity. Philip Hammond reminded everyone of the Government’s own analysis showing the deep harm that a no-deal exit from the EU would inflict on the economy. Compared to before, the attacks on him were half-hearted. After all, he was only setting out Government analysis of a set of circumstances the Government was unveiling hundreds of pages of plans about.Publication of the first no-deal papers, with more to follow in the coming weeks, has acted as a release for Brexiteers, too. As time and arguments run out, they can do little else other than say how they really feel.So last week we heard Jacob Rees-Mogg describe how the failure to find an agreed solution to the Irish border was nothing to worry about, as there were police checks during the Troubles. Barbed wire and soldiers pointing their guns through windows does not promise to be good for business, or the interests of peaceful cooperation. Only a few weeks earlier, Mr Rees-Mogg had been insisting that a technological fix could ensure the free flow of goods and people without harassment or delay.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit does not threaten union, says Prime Minister’s deputy            And last week we also heard the likes of John Redwood, confronted with the possibility that the basic premise of Brexit – a new and better relationship with Europe – might fail, fall back on the old script that critics never wanted the UK to leave the EU anyway. Brexiteers are at last being clear: theirs is a policy that cannot be held to account.Nor can politicians on any side hide from the most basic questions – even if they try. The clip of Jeremy Corbyn being asked six times whether he believed that the UK will be better off after Brexit was telling, even though he failed to answer the question. His evasions said all that was needed: no, he does not think it will. Even Dominic Raab’s insistence when asked a iant of the same question – will a no-deal Brexit leave the UK better off? – his answer was revealing. He claimed it would, saying there would be “opportunities” for Britain to exploit. These were hard to ferret out from reading the 150-pages of no-deal advice and preparations. The failure of Brexit talks is evidently an outcome that Raab is willing to accept, regardless of the outcome.With parliament returning for what will be its most important session since the Iraq War, if not longer, this is the least that we can hope for: that its occupants continue, finally, to say what they really mean, and mean what they say."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nWednesday 29 Aug 2018 2:47 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly

authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8615613.1535442232!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising abseil in aid of action ms","story":"\nA fundraising abseil was recently organised by the staff at Thompson House Hospital in aid of Action MS.\n\n                \nA team  including neurologist Dr Stella Hughes, Nurse Sarah McCallan and administrator Laura Fisher scaled the dizzy heights of the Europa Hotel.

creating 10 jobs, breathing new life into a vacant\u0026#160100-year-old building in Bridge Street and giving the town\u0026#8217s evening and night-time economy a much needed boost.\n\n                \nRecognising a gap in the market for enhancing the town’s hospitality provision not just during the day but also after 5pm, Barrel and Bean is a new venture by entrepreneur Jamie McCutcheon who also owns local business, HealthBod Fitness, which specialises in personal and group training.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAlready the fledgling business is showing early signs of being a great success, with customers from the town and further afield flocking to the top-notch venue to sample a delectable selection of sweet and savoury food accompanied by a wide range of premium quality beverages.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nKeen to show their support for the new business, Councillor Paul Greenfield accompanied by Councillor Mark Baxter and Alderman Paul Rankin, were among the first well-wishers to visit Barrel and Bean.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf course they could not leave without enjoying a refreshing cup of coffee and sampling some cake and tray bakes supplied by The Little Bakehouse, Dromore and Tasty Wee Numbers, Ballynahinch.\n\nEconomic Development and Regeneration Committee Chair, Councillor Paul Greenfield, commented: “Supporting the growth of a vibrant and thriving evening and night-time economy in all urban centres in the borough is a key council priority – so it’s great to see Dromore benefit from this new investment.\n\nWith its newly expanded visitor offering, Dromore has an equally important role to play in strengthening the evening and night-time economy, and like other towns in the borough should be viewed among prospective hospitality providers as an attractive destination for investment.\n\nBarrel and Bean is already delivering big gains for the town – creating employment, rejuvenating a disused building, encouraging locals and visitors to socialise in the town well into evening and acting as a catalyst for further investment. I wish Jamie and his team every success in the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council has recently approved a new five-year Evening Economy Development strategy, supporting its growth and diversification, in particular within strategic areas of night-time activity.\n\nThe strategy incorporates retail, arts, culture and leisure and supports and promotes existing businesses in their evening operations, encourages the extension of day time activities and strives to attract new evening uses and events that add to the evening economy.\n\nAn individual action plan has also been produced for all six urban centres, reflecting each centre’s unique and diverse assets, and identifying priorities for promoting their continued growth.\n\nBarrel and Bean is open Tuesday and Wednesday , Thursday and Friday , Saturday  and Sunday .\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8615611.1535442185!/image/image.jpg","title":"tremendous results at rathfriland high","story":"\nRathfriland High School has enjoyed another successful academic year withpupils achieving a \u0026#8220tremendous set of results which reflect the very good education provided\u0026#8221. \n\n                \nOnce again, an impressive number of pupils in the cohort achieved five or more GCSE passes at A* - C. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPrincipal Mrs A McCullough said the results reward the hard work of the pupils, the dedication of the staff and very positive parental support. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It is also important to recognise the contribution of our partners in the Banbridge Area Learning Community, “ she said. “This partnership allows us to offer a diverse range of subjects which affords pupils a wider choice at KS4.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“This year’s set of results reinforces our reputation as a high performing, non-selective secondary school. \n\n“Rathfriland High School has provided opportunities and opened doors across a diverse range of further education and training which will allow these leavers to choose whichever pathway most suits their skills and talents. \n\n“I would like to congratulate our pupils on their success, perseverance and industry. \n\n“I would also pay tribute to the talented and professional teaching staff who play a pivotal role in these achievements.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Parents also provide crucial support for our young people and I wish to thank them. \n\n“The performance of some pupils is particularly worthy of note, Alexandria Harbinson, Geri Georgieva, Laura Adams, Emily Cantley, Mallory Lutton, Jessica Thomas and Kerry Martin.\t\n\n“Success such as this only comes about when pupils, parents and staff work together to ensure all children reach their potential.  \n\n“We celebrate all our pupils’ achievement at this time and wish them every success for the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"excitement ahead of pope visit","story":"\n\nCATHOLIC\n churches around the city are bedecked with bunting and Papal flags as excitement builds ahead of the historic visit from the Holy Father Pope Francis to Ireland this weekend.\nThe momentous visit is being held to mark the World Meeting of Families , staged every three years for families to celebrate, pray and reflect together. This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow  so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today  for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mixed bag for belfast sides in antrim championships","story":"\n\nTHE Antrim\n

pre-game lead when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home

afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex O’Boyle with their two goals.\nThere was no let-up from Oisin’s after the break as they piled on the scores and O’Boyle completed his hat-trick of goals to run out convincing winners.\n\nJunior Football Championship\nIn the Junior Football Championship on Friday, last year’s beaten finalists, St Patrick’s, Lisbirn eased to a 3-13 to 0-3 over Éire Óg at the Cricky.\nThe Lisburn men were well on top and were 0-9 to 0-1 ahead at the break with Eoin Fay, Shane McEvoy and Josh McMullan catching the eye.\nMcMullan fisted home a goal early in the second period with Denver Taggart adding a second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the start with goals from Conaill Campbell and Daniel Magee and while Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh netter just before the break, Pearse’s still held a healthy 2-9 to 1-2 lead.\nThe New Lodge men kept driving forward in the second half and a third goal arrived from Liam Deegan from the penalty spot to wrap up their victory and place in the last eight.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster defends lack of

In the interim, management have done nothing to address their broken relationship with the workforce indeed they have attempted to play workers against each other by misrepresenting our criticism of senior management in the HR department as being criticism of those employed by the department as a whole,\" Mr Parry claimed.\n\n\"What is more, they have added insult to injury by claiming to be unaware of what is at the root of the workforces’ concerns.\n\n“Senior management in the council have adopted a heavy-handed approach in negotiations around job matching and restructuring around the establishment of the new Super-Council under the Review of Public Administration. They have also failed to engage through the formal negotiating structures with the trade unions.\"\n\nMr Parry called on the council\u0027s management to intervene before it\u0027s too late.\n\n“The trade unions have offered a series of dates for talks with management at the Labour Relations Agency. Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action. This is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\n“The industrial ballot will open for ten days commencing Friday August 31st. In the meantime the workforce will hold a protest at the upcoming council meeting in Downshire Civic Centre on Monday September 3rd.\n\n\"In order to avoid any further escalation, the trade unions are calling on the councillors intervene to ensure that the Chief Executive and his senior team adopt a more constructive approach to resolving this dispute”, Mr Perry said.\n\nA Newry Mourne and Down Council spokesperson said they were still in discussions wit h the trade unions. \n\n“The statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the Council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday 24 August where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on 3 September, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said that the council remained hopeful an agreement could be reached to resolve the dispute.\n\n\"Trade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part. We are working closely with all staff to ensure that they are settled in new posts as soon as possible,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The Council remains absolutely committed to resolving this issue with the unions, however negotiations must be conducted in good faith and in a spirit of co-operation and transparency.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts delays in belfast centre after primark blaze","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

People started walking out quickly and I followed the crowd.\n\n“Before I knew it there was smoke everywhere and flames, even though it seemed to start off very small.\n\n“The mood was very confused in the shop, everyone could smell the smoke but nobody could tell what was going on.”\n\nShe added: “It’s a shock and a very scary moment.”\n\nWithin minutes the entire building was emptied and the flames tore through the top floor.\n\nBelfast City Councillor Jim Rodgers said he had been told tar was being laid on the roof of the building shortly before the fire started.\n\nA number of loud bangs were heard on the street below, believed to be gas cannisters.\n\n“Inquiries are still at a very early stage but I’ve been told by a number of people that the fire started on the roof, seemingly it was tar being put down on the roof as part of the refurbishment of the building.\n\n“It’s been worked on for so long and within minutes it’s disappeared into an absolute inferno.\n\n“I’ve got to praise the fire and rescue service, there’s a large number of them here and they’ve done a brilliant job in bringing the fire under control.”\n\nSinn Fein Mayor of Belfast Deirdre Hargey has urged members of the public to keep a safe distance from the site.\n\n“I would also ask the public to avoid the Castle Street and Royal Avenue avoided whilst the incident is ongoing,\" she said.\n\n“Emergency services at the scene and responding. I would urge the public to be cautious and to assist the emergency services in whatever way possible.\"\n\nDesigned by architect Sir Robert Taylor, the historic Bank Building was constructed in 1785 and opened in 1787. It was later a shop and drapery firm at ious points.\n\nThe building was extensively damaged by three bombs on April 9 1975, this was followed by a fire which forced then tenants Boots to move out.\n\nIt was then refurbished in 1979 and reopened by current owners Primark.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"teen dancer natasha oconnor stricken with rare spinal condition","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It was a big shock and we are still getting our heads around it.\n\n\"When we got the diagnosis and they said they would make a referral for her to see an orthopaedic surgeon, but it would take at least four months, so we went to see a private consultant.\n\n\"The consultant said he could offer her a brace, and we asked him if he could guarantee it would keep the condition at bay.\n\n\"He said no, that it could progress, and that they would X-ray her six months after the brace and if it progressed they would refer her for fusion.\n\n\"That would involve fusing her spine with rods and screws which could limit her mobility and growth.\"\n\nIn search of a treatment which would allow her daughter to continue with her passion for dancing, Mandy began to research the condition and came across vertebral body tethering  - a procedure not available here.\n\n\"It is a keyhole surgery and it doesn\u0027t affect growth. They put a \u0027cord\u0027 between each vertebrae so the spine will continue to grow,\" she explained. \"It\u0027s not a 100% fix, but it will straighten the curvature to maybe 10 degrees and it\u0027s a one-off, less invasive operation than fusion.\n\n\"We have found a surgeon in Turkey who has advised us to act fast, as the curvature is already 45 degrees, and if she continues to grow it will get worse.\n\n\"Another 10 to 15 degrees and she will no longer be a candidate for VBT.\n\n\"The surgery costs £35,000 and the surgeon said he would take her before the new school term started. It\u0027s just trying to get the funds, and as soon as that happens we will go. We\u0027re hoping to get her over by the end of October at the latest.\"\n\nMandy, who admits that she didn\u0027t know what scoliosis was just a couple of months ago, says that her family has been on a \"rollercoaster\" as they try to come to terms with the condition and secure treatment.\n\n\"Natasha is very down at the moment, it\u0027s very hard for such a young girl,\" she explained.\n\n\"She\u0027s not happy about the operation, but we feel it\u0027s the only way forward for the rest of her life and she will be able to get back dancing, whereas fusion would limit everything.\n\n\"Dancing is her life - she dances three days a week, she has so many friends and she doesn\u0027t know any different - she has been dancing since she was four.\n\n\"She is about to go into third year at college and she wants to do dancing and hair and beauty.\n\n\"At the minute she can still dance and they say the dancing is good exercise, but if she has any discomfort she has to stop.\"\n\nMandy has been gaining support from online forums, which have enabled her to talk to other parents whose children have suffered the same condition and undergone VBT surgery.\n\nThe family are appealing for the public\u0027s support so Natasha can travel to Turkey for her operation as soon as possible.\n\nTo donate, visit her cousin Ryan Hegarty\u0027s page at www.gofundme/natashas-spinal-operation\n"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster it was my decision not to send anyone from dup to papal visit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

That’s their call, they have to defend their own decision in that regard.”\n\nMr Swann said he felt it was important that the UUP was represented at the event.\n\n“I have made it clear since I became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party that we want to represent broad unionism in Northern Ireland,” he said.\n\n“We actually believe it when we say about outreaching to people and all sections of the community, so we thought it was important that when the leader of a major faith here in Northern Ireland came to this island that we sent representation.\n\n“We were invited, so we went.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfasts historic primark building was originally the bank of four johns","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Cunningham in 1785, built in red Dumfries sandstone.\n\nThe original bank opened in 1787 under the name of “The Bank of the Four Johns”, as all four founders went by the name.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPeople look on as firefighters tackle a major blaze \n\n\n\n\nThe bank’s finances eventually collapsed, and the building was later used as the residence of the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Rev Dr William Dickson.\n\nDuring the time of public executions, the road in front of the building was used for executing criminals, and in 1816, the last public execution was carried out on its doorstep.\n\nReports say the last three people to be hanged were weavers who had twice attacked the home of their employer, Francis Johnston, in an argument over wages.\n\nIn 1805, the building was converted into a shop.\n\nIn 1853, William Robertson and Henry Hawkins from Waterford, JC Ledlie from Cork, and Robert Ferguson of Belfast, founded a wholesale drapery business, which became a department store.\n\nIn 1900, the ground and first floors of the building underwent a major redesign, and architect WH Lynn allowed for large plate glass windows to be installed in the lower floors.\n\nUntil 1961, only the ground and first floors were used as a shop, the remainder of the building was taken up by the warehouse.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nFire and smoke rise into the air \n\n\n\n\nLater that year, the Bank Buildings underwent total renovation, with a modernised main entrance added at Castle Junction, and the pillars on the ground floor removed.\n\nRepresentatives from Robertson, Ledlie, Ferguson \u0026 Company attended the first ever meeting of the Northern Amateur Football League at Clarence Place Hall on July 4, 1923.\n\nThe league was open to applications from public bodies, private associations, schools and firms.\n\nAlthough they originally submitted a team, Bank Buildings Football Club never played a competitive match.\n\nThey are still considered one of the founding members of the Amateur League.\n\nIn 1969, the shares of Robertson, Ledlie, Ferguson and Company were sold to the House of Fraser group.\n\nHowever, Robertson, Ledlie, Ferguson and Company continued to run the shop, and four years later, Boots acquired the Bank Buildings when it took over House of Fraser.\n\nOn April 9, 1975, three bombs exploded in the Bank Buildings and a fire broke out causing extensive damage.\n\nIn 1979, the Bank Buildings were taken over by Primark, who refurbished the building and restored the exterior, they have operated in the building ever since.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"house of fraser stores to close as mike ashley takes aim at greedy landlords","story":"\n Hi

on the growing trend of “set-jetting”, contains details of more than 60 television programmes filmed in Scotland or which have Scottish links.\n\nThe 36-page guide, entitled TV Set in Scotland, is dedicated to the inventor and engineer John Logie Baird, who was born in Helensburgh 130 years ago and is considered to be one of the fathers of television.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe guide will be in attractions and available to download \n\n\n\n\nProgrammes featured in the guide include crime drama Taggart, filmed in Glasgow, and Hamish Macbeth, shot in the Highlands.\n\nDownton Abbey, Victoria and Two Thousand Acres Of Sky are also featured in the guide, which further delves into animations, documentaries, sitcoms and soap operas.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDownton Abbey was partly filmed in Argyll \n\n\n\n\nIt also has a selection of film highlights and contains special sections on Outlander, Doctor Who and famous Scottish small-screen characters, including Scrooge McDuck from DuckTales and Scotty from Star Trek.\n\nTV Set in Scotland is available for free in attractions and VisitScotland centres and for download at the tourism body’s website.\n\nJenni Steele, film and creative industries manager at VisitScotland, said: “The list of television shows and locations featured in TV Set in Scotland is not exhaustive, but this fun and informative guide, which contains firm fan favourites alongside little-known gems, serves as a starting point for visitors wishing to explore the many on-screen locations and nearby attractions.\n\n“The impact of filmmaking in Scotland goes far beyond production spend.\n\n“Scotland’s appearances on TV have the potential to reach huge global audiences and, with research finding that one in five visitors are inspired to visit after seeing it on-screen, the opportunities for the tourism industry are immense.”\n\nCulture Secretary Fiona Hyslop welcomed the new guide, saying: “Scotland’s scenery and built heritage, together with our diverse and rich culture have attracted countless filmmakers over the years.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may to raise

If they do pay their money then I will have the conversation with them. \n\n“Usually it’s when results are bad. I feel exactly the same as they do. It does get a bit personal sometimes. We went through a few managers there and I did get a bit of stick about that.”\n\nO’Doherty is crazy busy, admitting himself that he spends 70 per cent of his time travelling across the world to meet customers personally. For him the personal touch is vital when it comes to meeting customers and establishing relationships. \n\nFor that reason he is a hard man to nail down, but he is not afraid to raise his head above the parapet, as he did during the recent controversy over the pricing of Europa League tickets at the Brandywell. \n\nBut with 840 families in Derry, 400 in South Carolina and 320 in Dubai relying on his ability to grow his business, there are more important issues on his mind day to day. \n\n“I would never let Derry City get in the way of that because too many families depend on me here to pay mortgages and car payments and stuff like that,” he continued. \n\n“I’ve always made it clear to the board that I’m not going to available. The big concern I do have is that I am away so much, probably 70 per cent of the time I’m out of Derry – is that reasonable for a chairman? I don’t know, but that’s the way it is at the minute. \n\n“When things are going well it’s an easy job but when things aren’t going well, it’s a difficult job.”\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWith around 1,500 employees to cater to worldwide, there is a huge responsibility on O’Doherty’s shoulders, but it is one he carries well, with E\u0026ampI’s profits and workforce growing year on year. \n\nEven in his home town, so many rely on him. \n\n“I don’t even think about that, there’s no time to worry about that, you just have to get on with it,” he admits. \n\n“If I can keep the customers happy and bring in the sales from those customers, that’s key. It’s very easy to bring in a sale from customers who were happy with their last order. If that’s gone well, it’s easy to get the next ones. \n\n“We have some long-standing relationships with very big companies, some multinationals and the internet sector, we would count as customers and I would look after them personally.\n“I just keep going. I work very heavily in sales so I’m away a lot.\n\n“I suppose at the end of every year you sit down and see what the achievements were for the year and what you’re going to do next year. But I think I’m just too busy to reflect on where we are versus where we started.”\n\n“At the last count, O’Doherty’s personal value was estimated at £163 million, making him one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland. \n\nAt 25 years old, O’Doherty left Du Pont to start a business which focused solely on engineering. \n\nNow, 32 years on, the former St. Columb’s College student retains his hands-on approach. \n\n“I do get involved in things and because I’m an engineer, I’m very interested in research and development. I talk to a lot of customers who say: ‘I wish we could get this or I wish we could do that’, so that turns into a project. \n\n“I’m partly doing technical sales, but I’m partly working in research as well. I am using my engineering skills it’s not just a management job where I’m not actually doing things. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I think getting close to customers is really important, because you have to ask the question – why do people in Silicon Valley place orders with a company in Donegal? They don’t just happen to be driving past and call in and see us, we go out and talk to them and show what we have.\n\n“We have a fabulous work force, which is the big advantage that we have. It’s a mix between Derry and Donegal people who have a great work this, a good education.”\n\n\nDown time\n\n\nThat passion for his work continues to drive him on, be it in his office overlooking the building in Burnfoot, in Anderson, South Carolina or in Dubai. \n\nThere is no down time for O’Doherty it seems. \n\n“To be honest, I’m quite happy with my lifestyle at the minute,” he shrugs. \n\n“I would like a little more free time. I’ve just become a grandfather my grandson is 14 and a half months and I would definitely want to spend more time with him. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, so I would like more family time but at the same time I like what I do. I like engineering.\n\n“Earlier this morning I was looking at some drawings for a large project we’re doing for a client and I really enjoyed going through them. I wouldn’t want to be an accountant. A lot of engineering people tend to make out that they’re management only then all of a sudden all they are doing is looking at financial statements all the time. \n\n“I do do that. I can read a balance sheet, but I wouldn’t want it to be the main focus of my job.”\n\nO’Doherty has created something hugely significant right on his own doorstep. His value to his home town cannot just be measured in jobs alone, but by other contributions, which he does not want acknowledged in print. \n\n“He has helped bail Derry City out twice, once in 1995 and again in 2010. From whatever angle you choose to look. It’s clear that O’Doherty cares, and cares deeply about his home town, and the people in it. \n\n“We have the right people in this area,” he explains. “We probably underestimate how talented our people are. I sometimes think we lack in confidence. I go to other cities in Ireland and the UK and they seem to be very confident whereas as soon as our people get stuck into a project, they are probably more impressive than people from these other locations. I think that’s the work ethic particularly. \n\n“What I notice about people here as well, is that if they encounter a technical problem they are very innovative in coming up with a solution. They tend to try and work solutions out themselves. I think that’s natural. I think this innovation is very, very important.\n\n“It’s not all me. I started it off but I developed a team. My workforce and in particular my two directors Damien and Cathal they have done a lot more than I have in terms of what’s in this building. I may bring the sales in but what you see in the factory is largely down to them.”\n\nAnother key issue for O’Doherty is education in the city, primarily the development of Magee university, which he believes has been held back in recent years. \n\n“We’re still short engineers there’s not enough engineers and there’s the lack of a proper university here,” he insists. \n\n“Magee is definitely making progress with the new vice-chancellor but it should have been making that progress years ago. \n\n\"The reason that I feel so disappointed at the lack of sufficient progress in the university, is that, when I meet other people who own businesses and you get talking to them, one of the questions I get asked is ‘Why have you built your factory in such and such a place?’ There’s two answers I give them one is that I was born here, and two is that \n\n“I went to university here and I met my wife. I think you need a good university to attract good people and I think the university will attract people who will eventually settle here as well.\nThat will create businesses which will help the university and all of a sudden you have a virtuous circle of good stable employment. Without a university, it’s definitely more difficult.”\n\n\nRetirement?\n\n\nSo, does he have an end-game? At 57 years old, is retirement now starting to creep into his thinking?\n\n“I certainly think I have got seven or eight more years until I think about retiring. \n\nI will probably wind it down a bit. \n\nI would like to work less hours and spend more time with my grandson particular, but I still want to do something. I don’t play golf,” he laughed.\nThe last question is a simple one- ‘Do you feel appreciated?’\n\n“I think I am, not by everybody but it really doesn’t matter,” he says. \n\n“I’ve got a very good relationship with my shop floor in particular. I tend to come down here on a Saturday morning if I’m not away and walk around. \n\n\"I just want to know what’s happening, because I don’t have time during the week because of my travels. I just don’t get time. I like to walk around and if there are any new starts I have a worked with them.\n“Am I appreciated? I’m not 100% sure, but hopefully.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bus users urged say creggan bogside brandywell route proposals","story":"\nPeople living in Creggan, Bogside, Brandywell and Bishop Street areas are being urged to let their voices be heard on the proposed amended Foyle  8A route during the consultation which is to take place this week.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell said: “There are currently proposals to amend the current bus routes that service the Creggan, Bogside,Brandywell and Bishop Street areas.\n\n“Translink are to undertake a consultation this week about the proposals to amend the Foyle  8A route.

In April, Newry, Mourne and Down Council also backed the campaign to retain the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, vehemently rejecting the controversial proposal to remove it.\n\nSpeaking following Sunday\u0026rsquos community protest, Mr Hazzard said: \u0026ldquoFor 150 years the iconic sweeping beam from St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse h\u0026nbsp as been a fundamental part of life for those of us who live and work in East Down.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Commissioners of Irish Lights current proposals to alter this beam as a result of their planned refurbishments of the lighthouse are unacceptable and are therefore opposed by both heritage campaigners and the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe have unfortunately seen CIL\u0026rsquos modernisation policy diminish the unique character of Irish lighthouses in recent years.\n\n\u0026ldquoRecent problems at Tory Island, Mew Island and Fastnet are a timely reminder as to why we must not tamper with the special heritage at St John\u0026rsquos.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe message remains the same \u0026mdash leave our light alone.\n\nLocal Sinn F\u0026eacutein Cllr John Rice, who also attended the protest, added: \u0026ldquoSt John\u0026rsquos Point is one of the most iconic pieces of social heritage that we can offer.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe light itself can be seen right across the constituency and it is something that locals enjoy greatly from as far as the Mournes and Slieve Croob.\n\n\u0026ldquoI like most other people grew up always admiring this great light house and I feel that the Irish Lighthouse authority must stop their proposed changes immediately.\n\nEileen Peters, one of the local campaigners, said the protest was chosen to coincide with International Lighthouse weekend.\n\nShe said Captain McCabe from CIL made a \u0026ldquosurprise entrance with plans for the lighthouse \u0026ldquowhich unfortunately, are still at iance with those of the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoHe presented the case for a replacement light, which he claims would provide the same beam as the original, said Ms Peters. \u0026ldquoThis cannot be the case as the range of the light would be reduced by several miles.\n\nMs Peters also argued CIL had not taken into account reports by eminent toxicologists on the safe use of mercury in lighthouses, or the findings of the Royal Society\u0026rsquos Publication on the detrimental effects of LED lighting on epifaunal marine communities.\n\nMs Peters said that following their extensive research and campaigning they were \u0026ldquodismayed at the ease in which the heritage of Irish is discarded.\n\n\u0026ldquoLecale Lightkeepers would like to thank the local community and all who made their way to the lighthouse on Saturday for their support, she said. \u0026ldquoWe are grateful to Chris Hazzard MP, Cllr Dermot Curran and Cllr John Rice for attending today\u0026rsquos event, and thank Cllrs Patrick Brown and Gareth Sharvin for their good wishes.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u0026rsquos protest CIL said it had confirmed its commitment to retain the sweeping beam with an LED light.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights ongoing investment programme to maintain and modernise its aids to navigation, planned work at St. John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse will deliver environmental, safety and cost benefits and is part of the continuing investment programme of maintenance, upkeep and modernisation of our coastal services to the mariner.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main programme of works at St John\u0026rsquos Lighthouse, due to take place in the coming years, is the replacement of the light source with a new LED light. This light source will be housed within the original Fresnel lens and there will be no changes to the visual structure of the light source. The new LED light will maintain its sweeping beam and will use less than 30 watts compared with the previous 1000 watt lamp thus improving its environmental footprint and removing the need for a diesel generator at the station. It will also allow the removal of mercury from the station.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights has addressed previously held concerns relating to the sweeping beam and has reiterated that the solution being considered for St John\u0026rsquos Point will ensure that the beam will retain its sweeping feature and rotating lens will be unaffected visually.\n\n\u0026ldquoSince this project was first proposed in 2016, Irish Lights has engaged with local stakeholders, including Lecale Lightkeepers, on the replacement of the lens, and has taken on board key concerns raised by these groups and will continue to engage with the community on an ongoing basis to ensure the unique lighthouse heritage is protected.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights is currently trialling a system that will allow the lens to rotate in the same manner it currently does and will engage with the local community once again when this trial project comes to a final conclusion. When the project is in a position to progress Irish Lights will continue to consult with the local community and will ensure all planning and heritage requirements are met.\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights respects the right to protest however urges members of the public to be cognisant of tenants and tourists who are currently residing at St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celtic tournament success  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE club\u0026rsquos fourth annual youth tournament took place in Dunleath Park at the weekend and it was another overwhelming success with 70 teams participating over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning.\u0026nbsp\n\nCeltic Bhoys would like to thank all the clubs who participated in the tournament along with the players and spectators who attended on both days.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurthermore, they would like to thank all all those who worked behind the scenes with the club including Newry, Mourne and Down Council Officials Davy Duggan,Tony McShane, Rita, Lewis and all their support staff for the logistical support and the marking out off the 7-a-side pitches.\u0026nbsp\n\nSpecial thanks also goes to the local referees who officiated during the tournament and last, but certainly not least, all the club volunteers who once again outdid themselves to make it all possible.\n\nTraining has now recommenced for all the club\u0026rsquos youth teams.

The unacceptable delay of 17 minutes has caused us concern, the letter stated.\n\nBut the letter ended by warning that people who disregard advice and put to sea in unstable craft in bad conditions usually preclude rescue attempts.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash Bulldozers moved in at the weekend to begin work in Newcastle\u0026rsquos new street widening scheme \u0026mdash and one of the first landmarks of the seaside resort to get the chop was the street wall at Central Promenade.\n\nThe scheme, which should eliminate Newcastle\u0026rsquos chic-a-bloc summer traffic jams, will take more than a year to complete.\n\nIn the meantime diversions and changes in traffic flow are in operation, the main change being at Bryansford Road, which will now carry two-way traffic, and at the main access to Donard Park, which will now become an exit only, with entry beside Patton\u0026rsquos Bridge.\n\nCASTLEWELLAN \u0026mdash A Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, has offered a \u0026pound200 reward in an all-out bid to catch the thieves who stole several thousand pounds from her on Saturday.\n\nA shocked Mrs Smyth told the Recorder that over \u0026pound5,000 worth of assorted furniture was taken and that she may have little chance of recovering it.\n\nThe burglary, described by Mrs Syth, as a \u0026ldquowell organised and large scale operation, occurred in the early hours when she was asleep at her home in Ballywillwill.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy husband and I were awakened by a notice outside. My husband got up and saw people outside. They had already loaded a van with furniture and were packing other items into a car, she said.\n\nMrs Smyth plans to do everything possible to bring the burglars to justice. \u0026ldquoI am offering \u0026pound200 as a reward in an attempt to get information about the incident. I would be satisfied just to know that the offenders were safely behind bars.\n\n\u0026ldquoSomeone in the area must know who was responsible and I only hope that this reward may help in tracing them.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash Portaferry police are investigating a mystery death which occurred in the town on Saturday. The body of 47 year-old Mr John Glenn Clugston was found lying in a tent in afield adjacent to Mountain Road.\n\nA police spokesman said that the man lived in Dundonald and that foul play was not suspected.\n\nQUOILE \u0026mdash A killer weed which has poisoned several cattle and sheep along the upper reaches of the Quoile River has brought a warning for local farmers to be on their guard.\n\nSo far the deaths have occurred on a stretch on the river between Drumaness and Rademon, but the weed is believed to be spreading.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture experts have confirmed that is Water wart, which is highly poisonous to livestock. In this case it is believed that some of the weed has found its way into the river and has been washed up on the banks.\n\nThe death toll up to now includes a cow, a bullock and three sheep. In each case the poisoned animals had access to the river or one of its tributaries.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the weed resembles the more common and harmless \u0026lsquoFools Parsley\u0026rsquo, but is regarded as the most poisonous plant growing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoIf farmers find it on their land the safest thing they can do is to dig it up entirely and destroy it, the spokesman said. \u0026ldquoHowever, great care must be taken to do this properly. Roots must not be left lying about.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash More than 6,000 \u0026lsquoBlackmen\u0026rsquo from all over Co Down will parade through Comber on Saturday for the annual August procession of the Royal Black Institution.\n\nThis is the first time in 13 years that the procession has been held in Comber and some 118 preceptories will be taking part, led by an equally high number of bands.\n\nComber, being the host district, will front the parade and others will follow in numerical order. A huge public turnout is excepted and the parade will be setting off from a field on the Ballygowan Road at 12.30pm.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash A compensation dispute with a landowner is now the only obstacle to Downpatrick\u0026rsquos long-awaited new car park behind Irish Street.\n\nThe car park plans were given full approval by local planners this week and a spokesman for the Department of the Environment\u0026rsquos Roads Service branch in Downpatrick said that work was hoped to get underway in this financial year.\n\nHe revealed that one landowner is still blocking the plans because he is unhappy with the compensation being offered. If no agreement is reached with him the land might have to be vested, meaning a lengthy hold-up.\n\nWhen it does go ahead, the new car park will be built between Irish Street and Market Street and will hold up to 80 cars.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe hope to enter the construction stage in this financial year because money is available, the Roads Service spokesman said. \u0026ldquoWe are very anxious to press on in an effort to provide good parking facilities at that end of the town.\n\nLOUGHISLANDREAVY \u0026mdash A builders hut at Loughinislandreavy, outside Castlewellan, was broken into on Thursday night. The hut belongs to McCartan and McAteer builders and rolls of steel wire and a pair of wire cutters were stolen.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash Heavy rain may have kept the numbers down, but \u0026pound8,000 was still raised at a garden fete organised by the William Keown Appeal Fund at Dundrum Castle on Saturday. The money raised will go towards the Northern Ireland Council for Orthopaedic Development.\n\nThe fete was opened by Mr William Harvey and comperes for the afternoon\u0026rsquos activities were Commander Bill Martin and Mr Christy Brown.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe main events were a bonny baby competition, a children\u0026rsquos fancy dress contest, children\u0026rsquos sports and a closely contested tug \u0026lsquoo war.\n\nBetween the ious events the RUC Silver Band played a selection of popular tunes and helped to keep everyone\u0026rsquos spirits up in spite of the bad weather.\n\nGAA \u0026mdash Down\u0026rsquos senior footballers failed in their bid to reach their first All-Ireland final since 1968 when they went under to a smooth and rampaging Dublin by a margin of 1-16 to 0-8 in Sunday\u0026rsquos semi-final at Croke Park.\n\nIt is doubtful if there is any team that could have lived with the \u0026lsquoDubs\u0026rsquo as they hit top form in this entertaining game in front of a crowd of 50,000.\n\nDown team: M McCabe, T McGovern, M Turley, M Sands, C Digney , B Toner, P Murtagh, C McAlarney , L Austin , B Gardner, M Cunningham, W Walsh , J Byrne, P Rooney, J Digney.
