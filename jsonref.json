This is a major problem.\u0027 \u0027We should be #1 in vaccinations in the nation from day one — and we should be using every tool at our disposal to vaccinate as many New Yorkers as possible as quickly as possible,\u0027 he added.  It wasn\u0027t clear by Monday evening  if the city had worked out the glitches in vaccine registration site. Stringer\u0027s office didn\u0027t return a message from DailyMail.com. The city\u0027s and the state\u0027s health departments also didn\u0027t return messages.New York state moved into Phase 1B of its vaccination plan on Monday, allowing for residents over the age of 75, teachers, transit workers and police to begin receiving shots in addition to healthcare workers. The new phase also broadened the types of healthcare workers that can receive the vaccine to include anyone who interacts with the public, such as licensed practical nurses, pharmacists, dentists and podiatrists. Cuomo, who had previously been adamant that all healthcare workers should be inoculated before the state moved on to other categories, announced the changes at a press conference on Friday in the face of criticism from medical providers who have been forced to throw out vials of the vaccine that expired before they were able to distribute them.   Even with the new measures, New Yorkers\u0027 path to receiving the coveted vaccines is still mired in hurdles like the ones Stringer pointed out on Sunday.    On Friday, Cuomo said he was working with the incoming Biden administration and hoped that New York\u0027s supply from the federal government \u0027dramatically increases\u0027 once the Democrat takes office on January 20. Without such an increase in vaccine supply, Cuomo said, New York would take another 47 weeks, or nearly a year, to reach herd immunity levels. The New York Department of Health is setting up 20 mass distribution sites throughout the state over the next several weeks.Two sites opened in New York City on Sunday, one at the Brooklyn Army Terminal and another at the Bathgate Contract Postal Station in the Bronx. Another three will be open on Wednesday, Cuomo said, at the Jacob K Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, the Westchester County Convention Center and the State Fairgrounds in Onondaga County.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Marcus Rashford blasts unacceptable food parcel supposed feed family three days","story":"Share this article Naomi Willis from Skint Dad commented: \u0027While it seems that some food parcels have been good quality, there is a distinct lack of consistency, compared to the previous voucher scheme.\u0027The food parcels provided to parents in the current lockdown should be able to feed a child for a week, but what we\u0027ve seen shared by Skint Dad community members falls far short of this and is clearly not good enough.\u0027This is adding additional pressure to struggling parents and is letting down children who are caught in the middle.\u0027The scheme needs to be reviewed immediately to ensure that all children are provided with enough food or reintroduce the previous voucher scheme today.\u0027Parents said the meals were dished out to children studying from home by a private contractor.Government guidance for the free school meals scheme says institutions can apply for an extra £3.50 per student on top of whatever they receive. It says: \u0027We strongly encourage schools to work with their school catering team or food provider to provide food parcels to eligible free school meal pupils who are at home.\u0027 It adds: \u0027Where school kitchens are open this should be the approach taken by schools.\u0027Chartwells said this morning: \u0027We take our responsibility to provide children with access to nutritious food very seriously.\u0027We have worked hard to produce food hampers at incredibly short notice during these challenging times.\u0027Our hampers follow the DofE specifications and contain a variety of ingredients to support families in providing meals throughout the week.\u0027In the majority of instances, we have received positive feedback.\u0027In this instance, the image on Twitter falls short of our hamper specification and we are keen to investigate with the relevant school so we can address any operational issues that may have arisen.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"UAE races vaccinate half 10m population April following 100 rise Covid infections","story":"Share this articleCovid travel: Why Instagram is still full of celebrities \u0027on holiday\u0027 -

Now, they have both been honoured for their contributionsAmong the household names featured on the new year honours list, you’ll find hundreds of key workers and community champions who stepped up during the pandemic and made a huge inidual impact.Here, we meet two of them: a child and adolescent psychiatrist and a pub general manager who, thanks to their innovative thinking, enriched the lives of those in their community – and beyond.“During the pandemic, people Zoomed, Skyped and connected with families digitally, so why can’t we connect healthcare the same way,” asks consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist Prof Alka Surajprakash Ahuja, from Cardiff, who was awarded an MBE for her services to the NHS during Covid-19. Ahuja received the honour for her pivotal role in setting up the pioneering NHS Wales Video Consulting Service, which digitally connects patients with clinicians.The programme’s success means the focus was extended to care homes, too. “That was a place where we had the most vulnerable people who needed help, but professionals were very limited in terms of access. It allowed GPs to do virtual rounds, continuing to provide the support and care they needed.” Dentistry, optometry and pharmacy followed, with video appointments revolutionising the way a growing number of patients accessed healthcare. Ahuja’s research into video appointments also led her to investigate their value for schools. “We know schools are not going to be the same for a long, long time. But children and young people still need support for their mental and physical health, so that will hopefully enable remote delivery of care into school settings,” she says.The technology has proved life-changing. “One of our first patients was an elderly gentleman living on his own. He had an appointment with the oncologist – it was a newly diagnosed tumour that was probably cancerous. He was very anxious, which was understandable. What helped was his daughter in London and his son in Singapore could join the appointment virtually, which under normal circumstances wouldn’t be possible. It meant having family for the appointment was much more reassuring and helped contain his anxiety. When we spoke to him, he was in tears. He said: ‘My god, I just couldn’t believe it – it was like my daughter and son sitting next to me in the appointment.’”Despite the punishing workload, witnessing the results has made it worthwhile. “I think one thing that kept us going was that we all believed this was going to make a difference,” she says. “I still remember the day I left my clinical job – it was hard because I thought I’m not going to see my patients and it’s going to be next to impossible. My colleague said: ‘Don’t worry, you’re making history’ and I laughed. Now, I think what we have done has been amazing. Post-Covid, healthcare is not going to be the same – it’s going to change the landscape.”As general manager of the Portsmouth Arms in Basingstoke, Richard Curtis was awarded a BEM for services to charity and the community in Hampshire during the pandemic. At the time of the announcement, he had raised £52,500 for charity through the virtual pub quizzes he has hosted on Facebook since the outbreak of the pandemic. With a modest goal of £150, his first quiz – which began the day after pubs closed last March – quickly gained traction, turning into a nightly occurrence. “I never expected it to be anything other than my regulars who come to the pub, and to maybe attract a bit of a local audience,” he says. “We didn’t expect it to go worldwide.”Curtis, who estimates he’s now held around 300 online quizzes since March and is still going strong, has seen his efforts bring together people from around the globe in a bid to help alleviate loneliness and isolation. With the first quiz drawing around 120 participants, at its peak up to 1,500 people were joining online.“From March, it very quickly went from one quiz a week to 18,” he says. “We were doing a children’s one Monday to Friday, which I hosted with my children. I was then doing an adult one every night, and then on Saturday and Sunday I did a themed quiz at three o’clock, another at five, then an adults’ one at eight.”With each quiz filmed inside the pub (Curtis lives upstairs with his wife and three children) it offered “the feel of the pub” for those missing it. “I made a rule that if people couldn’t come to the pub, I wouldn’t be drinking, but that soon turned into people saying: ‘If we donate £200, will you have a beer?’”The biggest quiz – a world record attempt held across VE Day weekend that lasted an astonishing 35 hours – raised more than £21,000 for charity (the world record status is still pending). “The money we raised was beyond anybody’s belief. That weekend there was so much hope for what people could have done, and what they were actually allowed to do,” he says of the weekend, falling during the first national lockdown.The world record attempt was surprisingly gruelling, he says. “I just imagined I’d have to write loads of questions and stay awake. But sitting in that position for so long, my back was shot to pieces. And while staying awake for so long isn’t a problem, constantly talking for that amount of time is. Because I’d been talking for so long, my throat and tongue had swollen up so much that I couldn’t eat. I tried to eat a bacon sandwich at one point and choked, I just couldn’t swallow it.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Time to turn to the experts for some tips ... From pay freezes to furloughing and reduced working hours, 2020 changed the financial circumstances of many people, so it’s not a shock to find that more than a third of British people are worried about their finances as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, according to Aviva.The pandemic has shown that the future is impossible to predict, but surely that’s all the more reason to prepare for the unexpected when it comes to your money.Resist kneejerk reactionsSelling your car or leaping into a less-than-ideal job can seem like sensible moves when your financial circumstances change suddenly, but it’s not the time for kneejerk decisions. “Never rush into rash decisions because of loss of income,” says Laura Stewart-Smith, Aviva workplace savings manager, “Instead, take time to think things over before taking any action in relation to your finances.”Impulsive reactions aside, moving quickly to take stock and regain control of your finances is something Stewart-Smith recommends for anyone faced with loss of income. “Don’t delay in facing the facts – doing so sooner rather than later is likely to be better for your wellbeing, and can actually help you feel better compared with the uncertainty of not knowing your true financial position,” she says.Build a budgetIf your income drops, your first task should be to draw up a revised household budget. Cheryl Sharp, founder of the accountancy firm Pink Pig Financials, recommends analysing bank statements from the past three months to track where your money goes and identify savings you can quickly make.“Categorise everything into how important the spend is – for example, your mortgagerent is critical but a take-away coffee is a luxurynice to have,” she says.With your budget in place, you can formulate a plan to live within your means and avoid or get out of debt. But don’t start a budget and then forget about it. “Share it with someone you trust for accountability, and then track, review and adjust your budget as your circumstances change,” says Sharp.Don’t forget to include annual costs. Plan to put money aside each month towards those once-a-year bills, so they don’t come as a surprise.Pick up the phone“Talk to your bank and any other financial providers you have relationships with because they may be able to help,” says Stewart-Smith. “Ask what’s available in your circumstances, and whether you can review your package or defer payments. You might have payment protection that can kick in if you lose your job or experience loss of income, but you won’t necessarily know unless you pick up the phone and speak to those experts.”Don’t ditch insurance“Check whether you’ve got insurance policies designed to help if the worst happens, such as payment protection insurance, mortgage payment protection insurance or short-term income protection insurance,” says Jay Lee, a mortgage adviser and founder of uAcademy, which provides training for mortgage advisers. “They might be part of a bank-account package or a mortgage add-on product, so you may not even realise you have them.”It can be tempting to cut costs by ditching insurance policies when your income changes. “Don’t – your home is your castle and you should protect it, so buildings and contents insurance is a must,” says Lee.Reviewing your home insurance policy, however, does make sense when your finances change. “If you’re worried about unexpected expenses during a period of reduced income, you could invest in add-on packages such as boiler repair or accidental damage and home emergencies policies, which will cover these eventualities.”Ponder your pensionIf you make fixed monthly payments into a pension, it may be worth switching to a flexible plan if making the payments is too much of a financial stretch. “It’s also worth reviewing your pension, as you may be paying higher annual charges than you would in a different scheme,” says Lee.While paying lower charges today won’t immediately put money in your pocket, you could end up with a bigger pension pot in the future, making you better off when you retire.Start a rainy day fundHaving an existing savings pot can help soften the blow when the unexpected impacts your income. Even if you haven’t got that to fall back on, don’t make the mistake of thinking saving is only for when finances are flush. The best time to start saving is now.“Some people believe they don’t have any spare cash to put away for emergency savings, but this is rarely the case,” says Claire Roach, founder of Money Saving Central.“Even when your income is reduced, put as much as possible into an emergency fund each month – aim to save three to six months of basic living expenses so you can take control of your finances during times of illness or unexpected loss of income, and continue to meet your financial obligations.”Consider new income opportunities A loss of income can hit hard, but it can sometimes yield new opportunities. Lee lost his job in fraud investigation for a UK bank during the first lockdown, but it prompted him to launch his business running online training courses for mortgage advisers, which now turns over £5,000 a month.“It was an extremely worrying time as not only had I lost my job, but lockdown meant I couldn’t find any other work to keep me going until the situation improved,” he says.“I set up my business hoping it would cover a few of my bills, but within weeks I was making enough money to keep running my household.”Above all, remember that support is available when your financial circumstances change. “Take all the practical steps to shore up your finances and make sure your money is working as hard as it possibly can for you. Also, check whether you can apply for any benefits, speak to your tax office to see if you’re eligible for rebates, and look into tax-efficient investments and savings vehicles,” says Stewart-Smith.“Then remind yourself that the situation is not your fault. Loss of income is very often outside of an inidual’s control. But there are many organisations that can help. You’re not alone.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

Black Friday had been strong, he said, and the firm’s websites typically got 20 times their usual orders in a day.The Hut Group made a strong stock market debut in mid-September, when its shares rose by a quarter to 625p. After the success of the stock market debut, Moulding was handed one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history – an £830m share award.Last month, THG bought the US beauty website Dermstore and it has struck partnerships with the fragrance brand Creed, and GlaxoSmithKline for its vitamins portfolio in the UK.The Hut Group was founded in 2004 by the former Phones4u executives Moulding and John Gallemore to sell CDs online, and expanded rapidly by exploiting a now closed tax loophole that allowed companies to avoid VAT on small goods, including CDs and DVDs, by posting them to the UK from the Channel Islands.The firm sought to improve corporate governance by appointing another independent director, taking the number of independents on the eight-member board to four. The Hut Group has been criticised for handing Moulding both the executive chairman and chief executive roles, along with a “golden share” that allows him to block hostile takeover attempts for three years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a555a2b94067f7392a7a888ac693e12ed3adbf/0_73_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eab9ee060a87e1e0888d81b57220abe3","title":"oil bitcoin markets ftse 100 bank of england fed pound","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsDeutsche Bank became the latest large company to cut ties with Donald Trump, with the firm that has propped up the Trump Organization for two decades reportedly announcing it would no longer do business with the disgraced president.Deutsche Bank has been Trump’s most important lender. The Trump Organization, fronted by his two older sons, owes the bank about $340m in outstanding loans. After a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s, it was the only bank willing to give Trump money....Although Bitcoin is still looking much less volatile than yesterday, it is losing some of today’s bounce.Matthew Cady, Investment Strategist at Brooks Macdonald, suggests cryptocurrencies could become the victims of their own success:Should cryptocurrencies succeed in becoming widespread in use, central banks, governments, and financial regulators are unlikely to sit by as they displace the role of existing fiat currencies such as Sterling, Euros or US Dollars. A more likely scenario is that policy makers could introduce regulation which might at best heavily regulate their use.With monetary policy continuing to play such a critical role in economies and markets, especially so during the Covid-19 pandemic, policy makers are unlikely to give up such an important macroeconomic lever.Bitcoin has seen a significant amount of interest, perhaps matched only by the level of price volatility, even in recent days. As a new technology, the financial regulatory response is evolving all the time, and regulators are likely to continue to fine-tune the rules around what is and what isn’t allowed. As the use of cryptocurrencies is likely to continue to grow, it will likely force policy makers to continue to clarify how it can be used and traded.At the end of the day, the process of attempting to weigh up the pros and cons of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is no different an exercise to any other asset class, but the latest risks outlined by regulators are important to keep in mind.The slump in US small business confidence last month partly reflects the fact that many small business owners are solid Republicans, analysts say.Here’s George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group:But while they may not have voted for Joe Biden, those firms are likely to benefit if the Democrats roll out a multi-trillion dollar stimulus package that pulls unemployment down faster.Edward Moya of OANDA explains: The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index confirmed the December labor market weakness seen in last week’s nonfarm payroll report. The small business index plunged as expected given President Trump’s defeat (small businesses loved Trump) and all the stimulus uncertainty due to Georgia Senate runoff races, and rising lockdown risks that remained in December.Businesses had no idea we were going to see a Blue Wave and that vaccines targets would be boosted. Wall Street is looking beyond the NFIB’s headline index drop to 95.9 which brought it below the historical average of 98. Small businesses are expected to see more relief under a Biden administration and that should help the index rebound next month. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has dipped deeper into the red as the pound rallies.Multinationals are suffering from the strength of sterling. It’s still up three-quarters of a cent at nearly $1.36 following BoE governor Andrew Bailey’s comments about the ‘issues’ surrounding negative interest rates. Over in the US, business confidence among small businesses has fallen sharply to a seven-month low.The National Federation of Independent Business reports that its small business optimism index slid to 95.9 for December, down from 101.4 in November.That’s a sharp fall, to below the long-term average (98.0), and the lowest since May.Small businesses reported that they are more concerned about their sales outlook and business conditions this year, as the pandemic hits the US economy.“Small businesses are concerned about potential new economic policy in the new administration and the increased spread of COVID-19 that is causing renewed government-mandated business closures across the nation.” BoE deputy governor Ben Broadbent predicts that unemployment will rise as the UK government’s job protection schemes end this year.During his speech, he also flags up that the economy will shrink this quarter, as well as in the last three months of 2020 - putting the UK back into an official recession:The lockdowns mean that, on a quarterly basis, GDP is likely to have fallen in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to do so again in 2021 Q1. This will no doubt prompt headlines about a “double-dip recession”.But this is quite unlike any normal economic cycle. Its size, shape and speed are all highly unusual. As far as medium-term inflation is concerned, what matters more than these gyrations in output per se – very large though they are – are developments over time in the labour market. The rate of unemployment is the best single measure we have of economic slack. It also affects households’ confidence about their income and is therefore correlated with rates of saving.UK consumers’ willingness to switch spending from ‘risky’ to ‘less-risky’ activities has helped to cushion some of the economic impact of Covid-19, says Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent. In a speech on Covid-19’s impact on consumer spending, Broadbent outlines how some of the money that would have been spent on restaurant meals, pub outings trips to sporting events was redirected.That money often went towards online shopping, takeaways, and products such as audio-visual kit for the home -- especially if it’s relatively easy to substitute old consumption with new.But conversely, households are more likely to delay spending rather than switch expenditure if they think the lockdown disruption is only temporary, Broadbent adds.Obviously we know that spending patterns were radically altered this year (as Kingfisher’s strong sales figures showed this morning). Broadbent’s analysis is that this ergence means there was less of a hit to inflation than one might think, and that big shifts in demand can push up costs (as the economy can’t instantly reshape itself). He also flags up that the furlough scheme shielded household income from the drop in national income seen in the first half of last year.Spending by today’s consumers has in part been sustained and funded by tomorrow’s taxpayers.The pandemic, and the waves of the restrictions that have accompanied it, have had highly selective effects. They’ve hit some areas of spending much harder than others.The decline in aggregate consumer spending would almost certainly have been more protracted and more widespread – affecting not just activities that involve infection risk but those that do not – but for the furlough schemes. These have helped shield household incomes from the big drop in national income last year.But that’s not the only thing going on. Spending on some of these “non-risky” things have actually risen faster than incomes – in some cases faster than they have for many years. So it looks as though consumers used some of the money they would have spent on riskier activities – going to restaurants and so forth – to buy other things instead.This makes sense. A pound less spent on one thing needn’t mean a pound less in total. Indeed under some (admittedly extreme) conditions you’d expect substitution of this sort to be one-for-one. If people are entirely indifferent between different sorts of consumption – if they’re just as happy with “non-risky” as “risky” stuff – aggregate spending wouldn’t fall at all (for given income). What they saved on one would be spent in its entirety on the other. The same is true if a rise in infection rates is expected to be permanent. If the future looks exactly like the present there’s no reason for saving – or therefore total consumption – to change.These conditions are obviously unrealistic. Some things are good substitutes for risky activities during the pandemic. Perhaps it’s not much harder to buy things online than in a shop. At a stretch, watching a film on a screen at home can replace a trip to the cinema. But going out with family or friends to a pub or a restaurant, listening to live music or watching a play – for many of the things we’ve been denied for much of the past year, there is no good proxy. As for the dynamics of the pandemic, one thing they’re not is permanent or even slow-moving. Infection rates went up very rapidly in the spring and, once lockdown was in place, they fell almost as rapidly in the early summer. With the promise of looser restrictions as that happened, it would make sense for people to hold off on some spending until the day itself arrived.Nevertheless, it’s clear that a fair degree of expenditure switching took place: some areas of consumption fared unusually well last year, even as others declined extremely sharply. Because it’s hard for economic resources to respond to large and rapid shifts in demand this may have softened somewhat the immediate impact of the downturn, enormous as it was, on inflation. Oil’s rally is being driven by Saudi Arabia’s pledge last week to cut its crude output in February and March.This production cut pledge is protecting prices during the ongoing travel restrictions and lockdowns, which are likely to weigh on demand.Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank says:Saudi Arabia in particular is ensuring through its additional voluntary production cuts that the market is undersupplied if anything. Royal Mail has provided clear evidence that of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.It say 28 areas across the UK are no longer receiving regular post because many staff have contracted coronavirus or are self-isolating. “Despite our best efforts and significant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards.“This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices to keep our people and customers safe. In such cases, we always work hard to get back to providing our usual level of service as quickly as we can.”Here’s the full story:The BoE governor told the Scottish Chambers of Commerce that negative rates would create complications for the banking sector, and erode their ability to make a return.“In simple economics and maths terms, there is nothing to stop it at all.“However there are a lot of issues with it.”This has helped to lift the pound, which is up three-quarters of a cent at $1.359.Yesterday, BoE policymaker Silvana Tenreyro argued that cutting the UK’s official interest rate below zero would be good for growth and could be done without crippling commercial banks.The UK’s top central banker has warned that the UK economy is suffering a ‘very difficult period’.Andrew Bailey also told the Scottish Chambers of Commerce that the latest Covid-19 restrictions will probably delay the recovery.Reuters has the details:Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday that the recent resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic had left Britain’s economy in a very difficult period that will delay its eventual recovery.“(We’re) in a very difficult period at the moment and there’s no question that it’s going to delay, probably, the trajectory,” Bailey said in an online speech to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce.However, he added that the basic shape of the recovery was likely to reflect the trajectory that the BoE outlined in a set of forecasts in November.He added that economic activity during the first quarter would be depressed until COVID-19 vaccines are widespread enough to allow a lifting of some of the lockdown restrictions.DIY chain Kingfisher is topping the FTSE 100 risers, after racking up strong sales growth during the pandemic.“The safety of our customers and teams remains our first priority while we fulfil the essential needs of our customers. We will continue to support our colleagues during these most difficult times, and I want to express my sincere appreciation for all our teams as they continue to operate in such a challenging environment. While the strength of our Q4 trading, to date, is reassuring, uncertainty over COVID-19 and the impact of lockdown restrictions in most of our markets continue to limit our visibility. Longer term, we are confident that the strategic and operational actions we are taking are building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth. We also believe that the renewed focus on homes is supportive for our markets.China’s stock market has just closed at its highest level since 2008.Financial stocks led the rally, as investors shrugged off concerns that valuations might now be too steep, and the biggest daily increase in virus cases in five months.Authorities have imposed new lockdown in the Beijing area this week, after 103 new cases were reported yesterday (and another 55 today).Our Covid-19 liveblog has more details: Authorities in China introduced new Covid-19 curbs in areas surrounding Beijing on Tuesday, putting 4.9 million residents under lockdown as new infections raised worries about a second wave in a nation that has mostly contained the disease, Reuters reports.The city of Langfang in Hebei on Tuesday said residents will be put under home quarantine for seven days and be subject to mass Covid-10 testing in the latest attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Gaocheng district in Shijiazhuang, Hebei’s capital which has been hardest-hit in the latest surge in infections, is gathering more than 20,000 people living in 12 remote villages into centralised quarantine as part of the city’s Covid-19 control, state media China News Service reported late Monday. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management says:The action reminds us that it is fear of the virus that has the economic consequences—although in this case, the action is probably too small scale to have a visible impact on data in an economy the size of China. Europe’s stock exchanges are open, and the main indices are nudging higher.In London, the FTSE 100 is flat, though, at around 6,800 points.Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says that anxiety about US politics weighed on the markets yesterday, helping the dollar end its recent falls.The US dollar has had a strong few days which would normally underline its status as a haven currency, but its inverse relationship with the oil price has temporarily broken as black gold’s strong start to the year also continued given the intended supply-side restrictions. Yet optimism surrounding the vaccine rollout remains, and with the new President expected to unveil a significant boost to spending in the coming weeks, sentiment is generally positive. The impending fourth quarter reporting season is likely to highlight those pockets of the economy which are in particular distress, which would add further fuel to the stimulus fire.By the same token, opportunities continue to arise from the present situation.Chris Weston, analyst at brokerage Pepperstone, wonders whether bitcoin’s slump yesterday was caused by a major holder (or whale, in the jargon) cutting their position:Bitcoin and the crypto space more broadly have been slammed, but you wonder how much of this was down to someone getting out of a position – the whales will tell you when they’re getting in, but when they’re reducing then its radio silence and this makes sense.Is this the flush out that needed to play out?Cyptocurrencies are rebounding from Monday’s rout: Some are linking the recent more frequent mention of “tapering” of Fed QE purchases as aimed squarely at speculative phenomena like the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and other crypto assets as well as Tesla stock.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.After a wobbly day start to the week, the markets are looking a little calmer today.Investors continue to fret about the Covid-19 pandemic, and the possibility that the US central bank scales back its stimulus programme faster than previously expected, should Joe Biden’s multi-trillion dollar stimulus package do the business.But hopes of an economic recovery as vaccines are rolled out are also supporting markets, although the World Health Authority has cautioned that we don’t get herd immunity this year.With Goldman Sachs forecasting prices could hit $65 per barrel by this summer, crude prices could keep rising as Saudi Arabia cuts output and the Democrats push through a new stimulus programme.As Stephen Innes of Axi puts it:Oil prices are gingerly veering back on the vaccinated, and hyper-stimulus path of least resistance as structural catalysts of vaccine distribution and activity normalization remains intact. Oil is not going to be an asset class that sits still. Speaking of volatile assets.... bitcoin has rebounded from a juddering selloff yesterday. After plunging over a fifth to just above $30,000 on Monday, the cryptocurrency has now recovered to around $36,500 today -- heading back towards the near-$42,000 record hit on Friday.Monday’s slump, though, highlighted why regulators are concerned about the crypto market, with Britain’s FCA warning that investors could be wiped out in shady ‘get-rich-quick’ schemes.Jeffrey Halley, analyst at OANDA, writes that yesterday’s was a ‘harsh lesson’ about the crypto market:I noted that some “institutional investors” called it a correction after its recent galactic speculative rally with some bemusement. It seems that the Emperor’s New Clothes syndrome is alive and well in 2021.

Five people explain why they made their home into the perfect replica of an earlier eraWill future generations look at the interior design of the early 21st century in appreciation? Possibly not. We do not appear to have crafted many design classics, unless slab-like corner sofas in mud-grey velvet are Eames chairs in the making. Our feature walls are gaudy our furniture cheaply made. Scarcely anything seems to be built to last, which is just as well, as the next Instagram-led interior design trend will be along soon enough.But there are those who retreat from modern trends into the interiors of the past, drawn by the allure of original designs. We speak to five people whose homes are portals into the past.My mum says that I was always into the 30s, ever since she can remember. I’d go around to my aunt and uncle’s house and play old dance band records. At weekends, I’d rummage in Patrick’s Saleroom, a sort of junk shop that’s still around today. I’d go there every weekend from the age of seven or eight and buy all sorts of weird things: gramophones, gas mantles, electric toasters, Bakelite hairdryers. I have an obsession with 30s vacuums. They’re the best! They really get all the crap out of the carpet.The music, the fashion and the style were magical. Even the food was great – everything was homegrown back then. I would go back in time now if I could, although I’d take my family with me. It probably wouldn’t live up to my expectations unless I was rich and able to do fun things such as go to the Savoy theatre and go out dancing.I grew up over the road from the house I live in. It used to belong to an old lady. She was well over 100 when I was a child. She was a real character: a former schoolteacher, very strict. Us kids used to call it the witch’s house, because if a ball hit her window you’d see an eye poke out from behind her venetian blinds. She’d come outside with a carving knife and cut the ball open. But she was a lovely lady, really. It must have been annoying for her, all these kids knocking balls into her windows.After she died, the house lay unused for nine years, until I bought it. I found her old ration book and letters from her sweetheart, who died in the first world war, under the floorboards. The letters were quite upsetting to read, knowing how he died young.Most of my furniture comes from Patrick’s Saleroom, unless it’s something rare and hard to find, in which case I use eBay. Everything is vintage, apart from my Alexa – but that’s hidden in an old speaker. I have a laptop for work and watching Netflix. But that’s it. I restored a 1951 Bush television, so I can watch old movies on it. I know it’s not from the 30s, but TVs weren’t popular back then.There’s a lot I don’t like about modern life. I find society quite greedy. Everyone’s a bit more selfish. If I live by any 30s values in my life, I suppose it’s trying to have good manners: be polite, and nice to folk, and help them as much as you can.When I come home from work, I like to shut the door and pretend I’m back in 1936. Not to the extent it’s freaky, though. I do go to work and see my friends and have a normal life. But my house is my little time capsule. The 30s stay here when I leave the house, I’m back in the real world.I forget I have a 30s house. If I don’t warn people before they come over for the first time, they walk in, stop speaking, then ask me if it’s my grandparents’ house. I had a postman come to the house once and ask me if my mum and dad were in. I get it. It looks like an old lady’s house.Everything in my house is 40s-style – or if it isn’t, it’s hidden away. I have three children, so there’s no way in the world I could get away without having modern things such as a TV and a washing machine. But the washing machine is covered with a curtain and the toaster is in a cupboard under the worktop. I have a real 40s toaster on the counter: I daren’t turn it on, even though it does have a plug fitted. My kids are always complaining about the toaster. They go: “Mum, why is the toaster in the cupboard?” I say: “Because that’s the way I like it!” But they don’t mind, really, because they know it makes me happy.I’m most proud of my living room. It’s so relaxing. I love the rocking chair and the old clock on the mantelpiece. If you don’t look at the TV, you can imagine you are in a 40s lounge. I love to sit there and read old magazines from the 40s. Sometimes, they have people’s addresses on the label. I think about them: what were they like? What lives did they lead?I get all my furniture on the island. There’s a brilliant place called ReStore that restores old furniture that people have donated: almost everything in my house is from there. There are two charity shops on the island that are also really good – I can always pick up beautiful things there and they aren’t expensive. The charity shops on the mainland know about vintage now they put up the price.I dress in 40s clothes, too. I love the style – it’s very feminine. The ladies always got dressed up to go out back then. They took care, you know? No leggings and long T-shirts! I always wear a skirt, no matter what I’m doing. You have to wear thick tights in winter, though.I love the simplicity of the era. It’s not over the top, like it is now. There’s too much stuff now. It’s all about what car you have, or what clothes you wear. Even modern cars are stressful. There’s so much that can go wrong with them. Back then, things were simple and modest. It felt like everyone was in it together. People were different – they did things for each other. I love that sense of neighbourliness and community.If I had the chance to go back to the 40s, I’d love to go. Not to stay there – I imagine it was pretty terrifying to live through the war. But maybe after the war, when it was all over, to visit a world without cars and people everywhere. That’s one of the reasons my husband and I moved to Uist – to get away from technology and crowds and to live a simpler life. There are plenty of places on the island where you can look around and it’s exactly as it would have been in the 40s. Although, sadly, technology has followed us to the island – we got 4G last year. I’m constantly looking at my phone now. Adverts pop up and I think: “Ooh, I’d love to buy that.” I wish I wasn’t looking at my phone all the time.I’d say my style is mid-century American ranch style, with a tiki influence. I’ve always loved vintage style, ever since I was a teenager. In the 80s, I was into the mod scene. I remember walking into a friend’s house when I was about 19 and everything was styled like the 50s: there was a cocktail bar and 50s magazines. I thought it was so stylish. After that, I never looked back: I’ve decorated all of my houses in a vintage way.When I started collecting in the 80s, you could pick up stuff in charity shops and flea markets for next to nothing. I still have a 50s pale-green and pink bedroom suite I got at a Manchester flea market in the early 90s. Nowadays, I get most of my things through specialist dealers, although you can also get good pieces from eBay and Etsy if you look hard enough. I’d love some Heywood-Wakefield or Paul Frankl rattan furniture and I’m desperate for an Alfred Meakin cactus teapot – I have almost the full set, but I’m missing the teapot.I have two cocktail bars. They are pretty special. One is a mid-century bar with a glitter vinyl front. My tiki bamboo bar I got from a friend who was selling it. I’ve owned several bamboo bars over the years. At one point, I had about four bars in my house at the same time. I had to get rid of them, though – you can’t keep them all.I do have modern bits in the house. My kitchen isn’t original. It’s styled on a Youngstown kitchen from the US it would be difficult and expensive to ship one over, so I created the look using chevron cupboard pulls and aluminium trim on a modern kitchen. I had really positive comments on my Instagram account from people in the US, which was nice.The only thing in my house that I really hate is the TV, because it doesn’t fit with the decor. We have a modern TV – my husband, Nigel, insisted. It is nice to watch old movies on a decent screen, though. William Morris said that you should have nothing in your house that you don’t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful. Everything in my house is beautiful to me, apart from my telly – which is useful!I don’t wish I lived in the 50s. I love vintage style, not vintage values. When I’m reading magazines from that period, some of the adverts are so archaic. It’s all about buying the woman in your life a vacuum cleaner for Christmas. But I couldn’t live in modern surroundings, either. This trend for grey at the moment – I can’t bear it. Everything is grey. People are even painting the exterior of their houses grey! I need colour in my life.I’ve felt so fortunate to have this beautiful home during Covid. I get so much pleasure from every item in my home. It’s so lovely to sit at my bar and have a mai tai while I put some lounge music on. I feel so grateful to live here, look at everything and feel wowed by it – which I still do, every day.I didn’t have a fantastic childhood. My mum died when I was six, of a brain tumour. TV was my escape. Every Saturday evening, I lost myself in classic American shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The A Team, Knight Rider. Those 80s shows often visually referenced the 60s and Americana. There’s definitely a bit of nostalgia there.My interest in the 60s started with cars. I’ve always driven classic cars. I have a ’57 Chevy – it’s black with a red roof. I love that culture of hot rodding and classic cars. It’s linked together, my love of cars and interiors.Living in Scotland, you need a bit of colour, especially at this time of the year. I looked at Chevrolet paint charts from the 60s. The dining room is painted in a turquoise colour that came from those charts. The dining chairs are Panton and the side tables are Bauhaus.I wouldn’t want to live in the 60s. I’ve always believed that things tend to get better, although the last few years have stretched that for me. I guess I’m a traditional person in that I like to work hard and live quietly. But, beyond that, I don’t really relate to 60s values. My wife and I, we’re equals.I like to combine modern conveniences with 60s styling. I’ve incorporated automation into the house, so all our lighting themes come on automatically at different times of the day. We have sound systems in every room. I love gadgets. But I make sure they’re all invisible. I don’t want them to change the look of the house, just make it easier to live in.I love things with a history. We put in double doors that I got from a salvage yard between the dining room and the kitchen. They were from a cruise liner built in 1959. They add layers of history to the house. When you touch them, it feels like there’s a story behind them. Being able to keep things going and give them a new life, instead of throwing them in landfill, feels right to me.My dad was an antiques dealer and cabinet maker, so I grew up with mahogany furniture – lots of Edwardian pieces and William Morris. I used to go to auctions with my dad from the age of three or four. I’ve always hunted for stuff – when I was a student, I’d go around picking furniture out of skips. I’m such a Womble! Back then, people would toss out G Plan – no one wanted it.Everyone says to me: why the 70s? And I say: why not? It’s the colour, the shapes, the style. There’s some nostalgia there, too, because I’m just about old enough to remember the 70s. My grandparents kept all their 70s furniture well into the 80s. Back then, people bought quality and kept it for a long time, whereas now it feels as if everyone decorates their home at lightning speed to keep up with the latest Instagram trend. People treat their houses like fast fashion, whereas, 30 or 40 years ago, people had a style and stuck with it for 50 years.I have a Decca TV from the 70s that I found on Facebook Marketplace, three miles down the road. It’s ridiculous. The same model is on display in the Science Museum. It does turn on, but unfortunately the analogue signal was switched off in 2012, so I’m sending it to someone who specialises in making old appliances work on new systems. He’s going to make it compatible with Netflix and digital TV.I’m really tight. Everything is from Facebook Marketplace, car boot sales or eBay. I could go to specialist dealers, but I refuse to pay £300 for something I can find for £20 if I magpie about and keep looking. Sometimes, I’ll spend years looking for a specific piece. If I told you my search terms, I’d have to kill you. What I will say is that, if you want bargains, search broad. Type “coffee table” or “lamp”. It will take hours, but you’ll find gold for cheap.We have modern mattresses – I draw the line on that. And we have a modern TV. Oh, and a Dyson. Old vacuum cleaners are awful. My prized possession is a Marcel Breuer long chair. My dad had one when I was a kid, but he had to sell it in the 80s because he was short on money. Mine came up on eBay and the starting bid was £500. I had only £500 in my bank account, so I sat there shaking, waiting for the auction to run down. Then, with three seconds to go, I bid and won it. I felt sick. I cried and then called my dad.I wear 70s clothes, but not all the time. I’m a mum and I can’t swan around in a Jean Varon maxidress if there’s a four-year-old trying to smear yoghurt on me. Do I have vintage values? Absolutely not. I don’t sit about waiting for my partner to come home. I think a lot of things about the 70s were really bad. Thatcherism was shit, especially if you lived up north. If you watch Love Thy Neighbour, it’s so racist. If I had a time machine, I wouldn’t go back to the 70s. Actually – that’s a lie. I’d go back, stockpile a load of furniture and bring it back. But that’s about it.What I like the most about the 70s is the mindset. The roots of sustainable living started in the 70s. The quality of build and design is that much better. Nothing looks like it will fall apart in the next 10 minutes. There’s years of use left in this furniture. I’m so glad to be able to save it from landfill.• This article’s main image was changed on 12 January 2021 for editorial reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/440c7f7a347cef4c0bc6ae43ffd62aa008cdb16d/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=813db29f87d0a5ada133c27af729bdaf","title":"from yemen to the uk noors story child marriage womens rights podcast","story":"A women’s rights activist tells the extraordinary story of how she fled Yemen after her life was threatened, and her devastation at having to leave her four children behind.

Noor was forced into marriage at the age of 14, but later managed to orce her husband.  She travelled alone with only smugglers and other desperate migrants for company on a terrifying eight-month journey to Britain. Noor was determined to flee not only because her own life was in danger, but also in the hope of rescuing her four children from the Yemen civil war once she had reached safety, and because her children’s lives would be at risk if she remained in the country. She describes the devastating impact of leaving them behind. Her oldest daughter is at risk of child marriage in Yemen, and she says time is running out to bring her children to safety. Anushka also talks to the ’s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, who examines why Yemen has been described as one of the worst places in the world to be a woman and how unusual and brave it is for a woman from such a country to embark on this kind of journey unaccompanied.

Welcome to Brexit, sir, I’m sorry.”The ban came into force on New Year’s Day as the Brexit transition period came to an end, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) saying travellers should “use, consume, or dispose of” prohibited items at or before the border.“From 1 January 2021 you will not be able to bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (eg a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,” the Defra guidance for commercial drivers states.The European commission says the ban is necessary because meat and dairy products can contain pathogens causing animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or swine fever and “continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the union”.Dutch customs also posted a photograph of foodstuffs ranging from breakfast cereals to oranges that officials had confiscated in the ferry terminal, adding: “Since 1 January, you can’t just bring more food from the UK.”The customs service added: “So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up.”• The headline of this article was amended on 12 January 2021.

So we’re in this extraordinary situation … at least as serious, if not a more serious position than in March of last year, we’ve got less restrictions in place.”“I think we are going to have to look in the next 24 hours or so, what are the other measures that could be put in place, and hear from the scientists as to which of those that they think are more effective, and then all pull together and support those measures if they’re needed because the numbers are still, as everybody knows, heading in the wrong direction on.”In his first major policy speech, the Labour leader called for the government to give employers the right to put workers on “flexible furlough” to allow them to look after children while schools are closed, as well as extending support to the “excluded” 3 million workers who have no support.Starmer said the government was doing little to support working families who had to work full-time and homeschool their children during the national lockdown.He said Labour in power would pledge the creation of 400,000 jobs in low-carbon sectors – “because this recovery has to be a green recovery”. He also said a Labour government would create a “high streets fightback fund” to protect local shops and retail, saying “Britain can’t reopen if our towns and our high streets are closed”.Starmer said the government had not honoured its contract with the British people by failing to get the virus under control after many months of restrictions.“It makes no sense to me at all that when we’re asking so much of the British people, the government is doing so little to support families,” he said, calling for “a legal, enforceable and immediate right for parents to request paid, flexible furlough and by promoting that to all working parents to help them get through this lockdown”.In his speech, Starmer laid out a number of measures he said the government could take in order to ease the burden on working families and their finances. He said the government could cancel council tax hikes with more funding for local authorities – calling the rise “a £1.9bn bombshell that lands a bill of around £90 on every family”.He also urged the government to pull its plan to cut the £20 universal credit uplift, which was put in place at the start of the pandemic, but which the government plans to cut back in April. Starmer said that would be “taking £1,000 a year from millions of families and pulling another 200,000 children into poverty”.He also criticised the decision to freeze public-sector pay for millions of key workers, people, he said, who had “got us through this crisis – including our armed forces, our care workers, our teachers, our firefighters and police officers”.Starmer, who on Sunday said he believed lockdown measures might need to be tightened further, said the government had been “found wanting at every turn” during the crisis.“Even in the best of times, you can’t be indecisive in government. In the worst of times, indecision can be fatal. Every time there’s a big decision to make, Boris Johnson gets there too late,” he said.Starmer said the public needed to hear daily press conferences with the underlying message of “stay at home” and added: “One of the problems we’ve had in the last nine months is the mixed messaging coming from the government, this made it so much harder. The vast majority of the British public will comply with the rules, will do what’s asked of them, but they need absolute clarity as to what those rules are.”The Labour leader was also asked if he could see a role in a future Labour administration for the former prime minister Tony Blair, who is reported to have been in advisory talks with Matt Hancock about the vaccine strategy.Starmer said he had spoken to Blair about his reports but declined to suggest he would be offered any formal role now or in the future. “I’ve spent many hours of many days, talking to many, many people about the pandemic, and I will continue to do so because I want to hear from anybody who can help us through this and to ensure that I’m as best informed as possible,” Starmer said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d3cd3fb73c3aa39cc618bdedc3a0c1d480c3cbd/223_252_3254_1953/master/3254.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a52c059d746e15b4402042ffdda86272","title":"poor families living costs have surged during pandemic uk study finds","story":"Thinktank urges ministers to keep £20 universal credit top-up and increase other benefitsMore than a third of the UK’s poorest families have seen their already meagre incomes squeezed during the pandemic because they have had to spend more on food, gas and electricity, and home schooling, a study has revealed.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that while UK household spending broadly dropped and financial savings increased during the Covid crisis, this was not the case for many low-income families, who saw basic living costs surge.The government had failed to provide effective support for the poorest families, it said, and with the third lockdown expected to last months, it urged ministers to retain the £20 pandemic top-up to universal credit beyond April, as well as boost other benefits for the low-paid.“The study shines an unforgiving light on the absence of targeted, adequate support for families on a low income, who today face the combined insecurity of Covid-19 and increased financial pressure,” said the study.This added pressure came after years of weak growth in living standards for the poorest households, in turn leading to a general worsening of mental health, it added. It said: “Financial worries have been added to the general stress and anxiety of the pandemic for many families with children.”While higher-income groups were able to save money they would ordinarily have spent on commuting, eating out or holidays – and often spent this windfall on luxuries – those in the lowest income cohort often struggled to make ends meet, the study found.One woman interviewed for the research contrasted how rising food costs had eaten up “every penny of her savings”, while her better-off nephew “has been able to get his garden done with artificial grass and bought a hot tub with what he has saved”.One woman with children, living on on universal credit, told researchers: “The assumption is that spending has gone down. But that’s coming from the perspective of people who have disposable income … If you had no outgoings on luxuries like coffee shops, takeaway, clothes shopping, pubs, eating out etc, then nothing has been saved.”She added: “Our only saving has been £2.50 a week we spent on playgroup, and on petrol as we drive out to places less. On a whole we have seen our spending increase. Our electricity and gas bills have gone up for a start, as we’re at home more. We have spent a lot more on food, especially during the first lockdown when there were shortages and we had to buy expensive brands.”Many poorer families found the extra costs of feeding and entertaining children at home pushed up spending when schools closed, as did the need to equip school-age sons and daughters with laptops and broadband access for online learning.Normal coping strategies employed by poorer families – visiting friends and families for occasional meals, or using the library for free internet access, and charity shops for cheap clothes – became harder as a result of household mixing restrictions and the closure of libraries and non-essential retail.The study incorporates research by the Nuffield Foundation-funded Covid Realities project, which has tracked the experiences of low-income families and carers over the course of the pandemic as well as surveys of 6,000 UK adults in May and September.Dr Ruth Patrick, a lecturer in social policy at the University of York, who leads the Covid Realities research programme said: “While the need for the lockdown is clear, there is an equally urgent need to address the additional financial pressures that families on a low-income face through greater income support to families with dependent children.”A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond to ensure that nobody is left behind.“That’s why we’ve targeted our support to those most in need by raising the living wage, spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs, boosting welfare support by billions and introducing the £170m covid winter grant scheme to help children and families stay warm and well-fed during the coldest months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/560ed6c400d3e49ef5b4715293060a6a0d7f9bc2/672_0_1938_1163/master/1938.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0c9ca709b0d11c88ee7bff1771fb528d","title":"how bramall lane occasional cricketing heritage was voted away cricket sheffield united the spin","story":"Fifty years ago, Sheffield United ended their ground’s strange use for cricket despite most shareholders voting for it to remainAs Britain reels from the impact of one advisory referendum, perhaps it is a decent time to remember another, of which the result – unlike the more famous and recent example of June 2016 – was promptly and most emphatically ignored by those in a position of power.“In considering future policy the directors will give full consideration to this view,” Wragg said. “This just proves what a set of fools the board would have looked if they had decided to move cricket from Bramall Lane. The board will, however, continue to do what they think is best for the club. This is not a referendum, but obviously the views will be given full consideration.”Within six months Yorkshire had been told to pack their bags. At United’s annual meeting in August, “some weeks” after the decision had been made, Wragg explained that “cricket had become an encumbrance” and “our move was expected”, with Yorkshire given an approximate timeframe of “two or three years” to make alternative arrangements. “We are not interested in having cricket at Bramall Lane because it would stop us progressing,” he said. “There is no guarantee we are going to have a good football team, but we must make the effort to have a ground fit for a good football team.”Cricket fans would see some poetic justice in what followed: Sheffield United made their decision having just won promotion back to the First Division. Ten seasons later they had been relegated three times, to the low point of a single season in the fourth ision in 1981-82. Currently bottom of the Premier League with two points from 17 matches, this is their seventh top-flight season in 44 and is looking increasingly like their last for the time being.It is not hard to see United’s motivation, however, given they had been playing in a three-sided stadium, with the cricket square stopping construction on the fourth touchline, restricting attendances and income, for the sake of four county fixtures a year plus a bit of Yorkshire League action. Talk about the end of cricket at the ground had occurred for nearly a century, since the 1870s when clubs using the ground in the summer had repeatedly been forced to find alternative venues so that Bramall Lane could be used for bicycle races. Notably in 1898, when the Sheffield Evening  debated ideas for the redevelopment of the ground, they factored in “a very fine oblong cycle track all round the ground”.In 1961 rumours of cricket’s imminent end forced United’s then chairman, HB Yates, to put out a statement “to allay the anxiousness which is bound to be felt by the cricket-loving public, not only in Sheffield but all over the world” insisting “the subject has never at any time been discussed by the board”. There is a slender chance this was not a fib.And then there was the state of the wicket. In 1893 Alfred Pullin, better known as Old Ebor, wrote “there is no mistaking the fact that the Sheffield wickets are not fit for first-class cricket”, adding: “The wickets have not been good there for some years. Such a state of things is hardly creditable to a first-class ground. The circumstances may be exceptional, but I know that some Sheffielders have strong doubts as to whether a good wicket will ever be possible again at Bramall Lane.” As controversy over the state of the square continued over the next decade it was widely accepted that pollution from nearby factories made it impossible to successfully nurture grass, though the ground’s pristine bowling green made such an argument logically problematic.But though as the years went on they only irregularly got the chance to watch the game, and even then on a dodgy wicket, the Sheffield crowd was known for being particularly knowledgable about and passionate for the game, if a little more vocal than others – in 1938 the  wrote about “spectators of the usual Bramall Lane breed, howling at times like young lions after their meat”. And they got to witness more than their share of history and drama. There was the time in 1877 when a batsman hit a shot, ran two runs and, on returning to his crease, exclaimed: “Now, you can’t do that,” and promptly died (the deceased, Joseph Parker, was perhaps not at his physical peak, being as he was 53, and a joiners’ tool-maker by trade).In 1935 Jock Cameron, the great South African wicketkeeper who was destined tragically to die of typhoid within six months, hit 30 runs off a single Hedley Verity over (one of the balls he hit for six was found the following May, lodged in a rainwater spout in the pavilion). Geoff Boycott hit his first century for Yorkshire there, and Herbert Sutcliffe his 100th. England played Australia there in 1902, the ground eventually becoming one of only two venues (after the Oval) to host both a Test and an FA Cup final. In 1949 Denis Compton, fielding for Middlesex, was bitten by a small black dog that had run on to the pitch.Yorkshire played there for the last time in 1973, a game against Lancashire which was, perhaps inevitably, rain-affected and meandered to a draw. The square was dug up and sold to fans for 20p per square yard, and work on the new stand that was to cover it started within a week. A year later it was reported “it is still not definite what will happen to the cricket pavilion, from which Yorkshire’s greatest names emerged each summer for an era which lasted 118 years and preceded Sheffield United’s formation by 34 years, but the choice seems to lie between a supermarket and a multi-storey car park”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/162fb3705a0d4b5a1f8fb68fa3798038b6a019f2/0_317_3327_1998/master/3327.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4b6f23f1400e963083bf6db37ee846d3","title":"what bitcoin why many people buy cryptocurrency financial regulator","story":"Cryptocurrency is attracting attention from investors and financial regulators alikeBitcoin is a type of digital currency that emerged after the 2008 financial crisis. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods. It has become the most prominent among thousands of so-called cryptocurrencies.It relies on “blockchain” technology, which is a shared database of transactions, with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. The network is secured by iniduals called “miners” who use high-powered computers to verify transactions, with bitcoins offered as a reward. There are more than 18m in existence, and the mathematical system controlling the generation of new bitcoins – which is decentralised and therefore has no overarching institution such as a central bank – has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins.There are several currency exchanges where consumers can swap traditional “fiat” money – backed by governments – for cryptocurrencies, which must be stored using a digital wallet. Some of the biggest exchanges include Bitstamp, Coinbase and Gemini. However, finance firms have also created new investment products based on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as contracts for difference, which are used to track the value of an asset without needing to directly own it.There are problems when it comes to using bitcoin as a currency, with many people simply owning it as a speculative investment instead, given its tendency for extreme swings in value.Within the space of a single hour on Monday alone, its value fell by about $3,000 (£2,230), then rose again by about $2,000. This makes it almost impossible to put a reliable price on goods and services.Instead, there are ways to pay using applications such as BitPay, which converts bitcoin funds in a digital wallet to pay for goods in traditional currencies used by retailers. Transactions are growing, more so online than in physical shops, with firms including Microsoft, Lush and Expedia accepting payments. The first-ever bitcoin transaction was made in 2010, when a Florida man paid a British man 10,000 bitcoins to order him two Papa John’s pizzas. Today that would be worth more than $300m.The City regulator is concerned crypto investment firms could be overstating potential payouts, or understating the risks, from investing in bitcoin and products related to the digital currency.As a newer and relatively lightly regulated market, consumers are unlikely to have access to state-backed compensation if something goes wrong. There has also been a boom in bitcoin scams.There are three main factors influencing the bitcoin price. First, the media frenzy over its boom in value, drawing in new buyers looking to make money. Second, more traditional finance firms are investing in the market. And finally, comparisons between bitcoin and gold, which fit with trends in the global economy.The development of Covid-19 vaccines could enable a swift economic recovery from the pandemic, at a time when governments and central banks are still providing vast amounts of emergency support – which could trigger a burst of inflation. Some investors view bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold, which can hold its worth during times of economic stress or rising inflation.Bitcoin’s value is almost entirely defined by perceptions. Some economists believe it is entirely worthless. However, analysts at JP Morgan have said it could hit $146,000 if it became as established as gold for investors. However, to match this reputation built up over millennia – as a thing worth owning, with otherwise little intrinsic value – it would need to become much less volatile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f81c02e6ca53caaa9de2fb63d0bd77bdc66bd71e/0_143_2119_1272/master/2119.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2f972dfccf6b0e43b5d1535c93fe8e74","title":"negative covid test required to enter england from friday","story":"Travellers must show evidence of negative test taken in 72 hours before departureInternational travellers will need to present a negative Covid-19 test to enter England from 4am on Friday.The government confirmed the start date on Tuesday morning after announcing the plans last week. Passengers will be required to take a test in the 72 hours before departure by plane, train or ferry, and provide evidence of a negative result or be refused permission to board.The move comes in response to the worsening incidence of transmission around the world and particularly the emergence of new coronavirus variants, ministers said.Arrivals will still need to isolate for 10 days in the UK, or opt into the test-to-release programme, which potentially allows people to leave quarantine from the fifth day with a fresh negative test.The transport minister Robert Courts said: “Both globally and domestically we are seeing significant increases in levels of coronavirus, including the emergence of worrying new strains.“It is therefore imperative that we ensure we are doing all we can to protect travel, reduce the risk of imported infections, including from new variants, and protect our NHS while national lockdown and vaccinations take effect.”The test standards are yet to be set out but will be mainly PCR tests and limited lateral flow tests. Courts said the UK government website would provide information on the kind of tests and documentation needed.The rules will also apply to British nationals, who would need to stay abroad and follow local rules on self-isolation if testing positive. The onus will be on airlines or other transport operators to check for a negative test and deny boarding without documentation, or face being fined. Passengers found at the border to be non-compliant will also be fined at least £500.Children under the age of 11 will be exempt, as will hauliers and transport operators’ crew. The measures are likely to be in place until the end of the lockdown, but will be reviewed before that, Courts said.Pre-departure testing will apply to Scotland and Wales equally but the start date has not been confirmed by the devolved governments.Airlines said they accepted the necessity for pre-departure testing but urged ministers to ensure it was lifted as soon as possible.Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said: “This is a national health emergency and ministers need to act to keep the country safe. It is true that much of the sector has been lobbying for pre-departure testing – but this was always predicated on the government removing or reducing the quarantine period at the same time. Now we have both.”He said the policy must be a “time-limited, emergency measure only”, adding: “We cannot afford for this to be baked in over the whole summer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8485366dd50e2a2737d5e7edf40975ae845dc9e7/0_55_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8bc93cd1049c240f751dcdb956126f47","title":"stay local england exercise rule open to interpretation minister admits coronavirus","story":"Kit Malthouse says people need to use common sense, as Met police chief calls for more clarityThe UK government’s “stay local” instruction for outdoor exercise in England in its current form is “open to interpretation”, the policing minister has said.Kit Malthouse suggested it should be common sense to define what staying local meant, but admitted the rules were open to interpretation.He said: “What we are asking people to do is when they exercise to stay local. Now, local is, obviously, open to interpretation, but people broadly know what local means. If you can get there under your own steam and you are not interacting with somebody … then that seems perfectly reasonable to me,” he told Sky News.Malthouse was responding to reports that Boris Johnson was seen cycling seven miles from Downing Street in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park in Stratford, east London, for exercise.His comments came as the politan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, called for clarity on the rules around staying local. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Dick said the rules needed to be clarified. She said that in the last year “countless changes” to the coronavirus restrictions people were living under had caused confusion for both the public and frontline police officers. “It can be complex to know exactly what the regulations are,” she said.Asked how she would define staying local, Dick said the term was both relative and commonsensical. “For me, a reasonable interpretation of that is that, if you can – and I appreciate some people can’t – go for your exercise from your front door and come back to your front door.”She stressed that she appreciated this definition of local would be complicated for some people, for instance those who have to drive to get to where they walk their dog, and not everybody would be able to do this.The police chief refused to comment directly on Johnson’s east London bike ride, saying only that it was “not against the law”. Pressed that the prime minister was a role model, Dick added: “The public are looking to all of us as role models, for all of us in public life, if you like.”She suggested a tighter definition from the government of what constituted local exercise for England, as has been set out specifically and measured in miles by the devolved administrations, would be helpful. “Anything that brings greater clarity for officers and the public, in general, will be a good thing,” Dick said.Under the England rules, people with certain conditions or special needs such as autism are allowed to travel beyond their local area to exercise and can do so several times a day.In Scotland, the guidelines state that local outdoor exercise should “start and finish at the same place (which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area) as long as you abide by the rules on meeting other households”. In Northern Ireland, people “should not travel more than 10 miles from your home in order to take exercise”.In Wales, there is no legal limit in the guidance on exercise but people are encouraged to stay as close to home as possible. The advice states: “Your exercise should start and finish from your home and you should exercise alone or with a member of your household or support bubble.”Scientists and politicians have expressed concerns over higher levels of public activity than during last year’s spring lockdown. Fears over public non-compliance are being compounded by the increasingly alarming situation in England’s hospitals, with rates of infections, hospitalisations and deaths putting the NHS under unprecedented strain.Dick said the Met would move more quickly to enforce of the regulations amid the health crisis. “We’ll explain, we’ll encourage, but where somebody is breaking the law, the regulations, and it’s absolutely clear they must know, we’ll move very swiftly to enforcing and fining people,” she said.Last weekend, police had issued more than 300 fixed penalty notices in a 24-hour period, she said, adding that people had been caught holding large parties, meeting in basements, and holding protests in the capital.With the NHS “at a critical point” and everyone’s efforts needed to comply with the rules, Dick said the police would continue to enforce the restrictions, including assisting supermarkets where a customer refuses to put on a mask and was obstructive to staff, and talking to people on the street if they were suspected to be breaching the rules. “It’s not dictatorial policing, it’s common sense,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d75574ccd35dda6cf4634e5ab3915ec626b4cd82/0_466_2828_1695/master/2828.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e8d07f39c4a8421e7dae932f7b575990","title":"inside the investigation into how covid 19 began podcast","story":"This week a team of international experts from the WHO will arrive in China to investigate the origins of Covid-19.

It just changes the strength of the opponent and in that sense we have to take from that that we have to redouble our efforts.”‘Near vertical’ growthWHO infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said countries such as Ireland had seen “near vertical” exponential growth in cases due to mixing over Christmas and New Year.“Transmission was down to single digits in most countries in Europe over the summer. And we lost the battle because changed our mixing patterns over the summer, into the fall, and especially Christmas and New Year holidays.

Photograph:  Todd KorolReutersThe Government is discussing plans for exceptional aid to beef farmers despite the presence of a Brexit trade deal, The  has learned.While beef prices have held up relatively well in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, Ministers have been told of the potential for significant impact at farm level, and for beef farmers in particular, down to market disruption arising from non-tariff barriers.The stronger beef price means interventions are unlikely to be needed imminently, but Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue said while it was “heartening” to see the price hold up, the situation will be closely monitored.Work being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine suggests that the non-tariff barriers may translate directly into lower prices at the farm gate for beef, and lower farm incomes, leading to the need for significant aid to the sector.The department believes farm incomes could be hit by up to 13 per cent due to non-tariff barriers, even though a deal has been struck.“The Government has been very clear from the outset that agri-food and fisheries will be the most impacted sectors, including in a deal scenario. We are committed to working with the agri-food sector to support it to meet the challenge of Brexit,” Mr McConalogue said.DemandsSupports being discussed include additional funding for rural development initiatives and local food supply chains, it is understood, as well as support for the tillage and horticulture sectors.However, demands from the food processing industry for an export credit insurance scheme are unlikely to be acceded to.It is understood that there would be significant complications in putting such a support scheme in place. Unlike many EU countries, Ireland does not have such a scheme in existence.A capital investment scheme for the agri-food sector has already been agreed worth €100 million in additional exchequer funding. The scheme is aimed at helping food processors modernise and ersify after Brexit.The fisheries sector, which is expected to be hit harder than farmers in post-Brexit redrawing of fisheries rules, may also see the introduction of a permanent fleet decommissioning scheme this year to compensate trawler owners whose livelihoods are threatened.With Ireland’s fleet of trawlers likely to be permanently smaller after Brexit, supports for coastal communities have been identified as a key policy by industry groups.Mr McConalogue said that the outcome of the Brexit negotiations “does involve the loss of quota and between now and 2026 and we’re very much aware that is something that will have a real impact on the fisheries sector”. About 15 per cent of the Irish fisheries quota will be impacted over the next four years.As well as the permanent mothballing of parts of the fleet, a temporary fleet tie-up scheme may be put in place from the second quarter of the year in order to alleviate initial impacts.DeprivedIn addition to this, the Government is examining investment support schemes for seafood processors and other aquaculture businesses, designed to be spread over the coming years.There are also plans to encourage coastal communities deprived of income to economically ersify, into marine tourism or marine infrastructural development – the redevelopment of small harbours and piers, for example.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The Capitol building in Washington DC, the great cathedral of “government of the people, by the people, for the people” was invaded and desecrated. Worse still, this happened at the hands of a mob incited and motivated by the president of the United States himself. On the same day, in Hong Kong, 53 pro-democracy legislators and campaigners were arrested for “subverting state power”. Their offence was to have organised or taken part in primary voting to choose candidates for an entirely legal election. Such activity now amounts to “disrupting and undermining the Hong Kong government”. These arrests took place conveniently just after the EU had signed a new investment agreement with China, with European leaders played for fools. Meanwhile, voters anywhere trying to make sense of events are battered by categoric assertions that have no basis in fact. Trump has continued to maintain that he won by a landslide an election that he lost by seven million votes, even though there isn’t a single scrap of evidence to support him. Allegations about the dangers of vaccinations have led many millions of people in France to be unwilling to be vaccinated at all. In China, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, spoke last week of his country having “raced to report the epidemic first” and that “the pandemic is likely to have emerged in many places around the world”, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. The combination of a loss of trust in elections in the world’s most powerful home of freedom, the cost-free snuffing out of democratic ideas by totalitarians and the steady erosion of the public’s grip on what is true or false add up to a gathering crisis for the future of free and open societies. In Moscow, Tehran and Beijing, there is much satisfaction at the chaos in Washington and at the state of the West: increasingly unsure of its own institutions, polarised within nations and suffering severely in a pandemic that hits free people particularly hard. Global surveys have demonstrated a growing loss of faith in democracy among young people. Even in countries with democratic traditions going back decades, the space for effective opposition to incumbent governments is being constrained. In Hungary, the media and judiciary have fallen under the control of ministers in India, the Modi government is showing autocratic tendencies in Erdogan’s Turkey, some opposition politicians are in prison in Sri Lanka the government is empowering the military and abandoning commitments to justice and human rights. Complacency about democracy is too easy. We all believe the 20th century made the world safe for it and the Cold War proved its timeless superiority. And in the decades since, we have felt able to get on with our inward-looking disagreements without worrying about its future. We reassure ourselves that democracy has proved its resilience time and again. Isn’t it great that the courts in the US refused to entertain the baseless arguments of Trump’s legal team? Didn’t the Republicans do well to finally turn against him, rather than set aside the outcome of a presidential election? The system did indeed hold up. But we cannot be sure that it could withstand another president trying to stay in office whatever the cost, or another time that vast numbers of people believed an election was stolen. We can no longer be sure that the faltering performance of many Western nations in the face of a pandemic, the growing gulf between populations and elites, the discontent over inequality, the loss of trust in public institutions and the disaffection among young people are just problems we can overcome eventually, with the system still intact at the end. Attention needs to be given to repairing, sustaining, justifying, strengthening and defending democratic values. The virtues of freedom, and the human dignity and fulfilment that come from allowing competing ideas in a tolerant framework within the rule of law need to be advocated and championed again. Of course, this is a vast and complex task. Democracies like ours will have to forge a stronger common national purpose so that conflicting cultural identities don’t pull us apart. We will have to allow more decentralised decision-making. It will be vital to regulate social media so that varied views are heard instead of a stream of assertions that reinforce our prejudices. We will have to be better prepared for an unexpected crisis such as the pandemic. Such challenges will be the work of decades. But we can at least begin, with a robust defence against external interference, a clear-eyed understanding of what is going on under authoritarian regimes, and a reinvigoration of the Western alliance with intensified cooperation on trade, technology and security. Joe Biden’s election is a rare opportunity to do so, since he is committed to at least trying to bring the world’s democracies together. Given that Twitter last year alone deleted more than 1,000 accounts promoting state-backed Russian propaganda and thousands spreading Chinese official opinion, it is fair to assume that a massive effort is still going on to ensure voters are misinformed and misled. The world’s democratic leaders should agree to pool their efforts to disarm such attacks. They should speak frankly about the conditions in countries without the freedoms we take for granted. Tomorrow, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission will publish a new report on China, detailing a wide range of abuses including torture, arbitrary arrest, forced confessions and the incarceration of huge numbers of people in Xinjiang. Such findings should be taken seriously by leaders who still prefer to turn a blind eye to the nature of a ruthless one-party system. And with Trump’s go-it-alone attitude on the way out, Western nations should work towards finding solidarity on trade, so that Australia isn’t being penalised by the Chinese at the same time as Brussels pushes for a trade agreement with Beijing. If Joe Biden can muster the clarity and create the unity that is needed, democracy could be in better shape by the end of this year. He needs support from those who love freedom, anywhere in the world. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"muslim schoolgirl feels bullied school sent home wearing skirt","story":"A Muslim schoolgirl says she is being “bullied” for her religious beliefs after she was sent home from school for wearing a skirt that was “too long” and her parents were threatened with legal action.Siham Hamud, 12, says she was sent home from Uxbridge High School every single day during term time in December and told to come back with a shorter, school-issue skirt.The young girl’s father, Idris, said that his family follow a traditional branch of Islam, which means they want to believe in their religion in a pure way, which means women should only wear long skirts.Because of these beliefs, Siham refused to return to class in a shorter skirt, and now the school has threatened the family with legal action for her unauthorised absences.Siham, who is currently studying from home due to Covid lockdown restrictions, said: It feels like bullying because of what I believe.I think they should just let me wear my school uniform to school.I like school normally, and English, drama and RE are my favourite lessons but I couldn\u0027t attend.I find it annoying because I\u0027ve missed a month of school, so I have to catch up a lot. I wish I could just have gone to school as normal.It makes me feel left out, because I can\u0027t see my friends either. They aren\u0027t accepting me for my religion and that\u0027s wrong.I feel confused and annoyed that I can\u0027t wear what I want for my religion. I hope they\u0027ll change their rules so that girls like me wear skirts to school.Idris, an athletics coach, added: My daughter is being denied an education because of her religious beliefs.All Siham wants to do is to wear a skirt which is a few centimetres longer than her classmates - and I don\u0027t know why the school has such a problem with this.She is sent home to change into a shorter skirt then return to school later that day - but she isn\u0027t going to change her beliefs in an hour.The school is threatening to take legal action against me, but I\u0027m not forcing her to wear a longer skirt - it\u0027s her faith and her decision to make.She used to love school, but now she goes to school crying because of this - it\u0027s heartbreaking.Siham’s older sisters Sumayyah, 19, and Ilham, 17, both wore longer skirts to school without issue, but new rules brought in two years ago state that school-branded skirts or trousers must be worn.The school sent her parents a letter threatening legal action against them for their daughter\u0027s alleged unauthorised absences on December 9.It said: Siham\u0027s absence is being recorded as unauthorised. Unauthorised absence may result in a fine being issued, or legal action being taken against the adults who have parental responsibility or day-to-day care of your child.Legal action can be in the form of a penalty notice or a summons to the magistrates\u0027 court.I must ask that you support the school and your daughter by ensuring that she attends school in full school uniform with immediate effect.But Mr Hamud says he will fight any action taken.Siham makes her own decisions about her religion, and I can\u0027t make her wear clothes she doesn\u0027t want to wear, so neither should the school,” he said.She is being denied an education because of her religious beliefs, and I don\u0027t know how anyone can get away with that.While Siham has been learning from home since the new term began, Mr Hamud expects the issue to return once face-to-face teaching resumes.He said the issue is due to be discussed on a complaints panel with the school governors later this month.The school\u0027s principal, Nigel Clemens, said: This matter is currently subject to examination through the formal school complaints policy. It would therefore not be appropriate to comment further at this time.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tim davie urges bbc reporters avoid sizzle partiality","story":"The BBC must avoid the sizzle of partiality and stick to honestly reporting the facts, its director-general has said.Tim Davie said BBC reporters must be activists for impartiality but stressed that they should not take that to mean they should give up on compelling storytelling and produce dull reports.In polarised times, and with a proliferation of alternative news sources springing up online, the BBC can no longer take for granted that people still understand our intent, he said.Speaking to the Reuters Next summit, Mr Davie said: Do you need the sizzle of partiality to cut through in this space? I think it\u0027s really important to say that impartiality isn\u0027t dull.It\u0027s not the dry bit of reporting, it is absolutely a real appetite for evidence, for truth, for testimony. It can be really good, flavoursome reporting and I think we mustn\u0027t give up… we\u0027ve had some amazing investigative journalism, very compelling reporting for some of these situations around the world and we want to keep making it interesting.And I really think it\u0027s very important that those of us fighting for impartial media, for truth-telling, should not give way to: \u0027We have to do this in a way that gets the maximum clicks immediately\u0027, but also doesn\u0027t give up on the theatre of it, the emotion of it, all the things we want to bring.Mr Davie reasserted the importance of BBC guidelines which state that presenters and reporters must not voice controversial opinions or indulge in virtue signalling on Twitter, but he said that did not mean stars must adopt a bland presence on social media, saying: I\u0027ve always been a fan of big personalities, so I like my editors and people to have personality. I like them to be out there on social media.The issue was to reaffirm our vows around social media being just one outlet for our impartial journalism.Mr Davie also said social media can be a toxic place for BBC journalists, particularly women, adding: In social media we\u0027re seeing significant abuse, unacceptable abuse, of journalists. I have to say that this is particularly prevalent among women reporters – over 50 per cent in a recent survey said they were facing abuse online – so I think we\u0027ve got to be active in this and forthright and also supportive of journalists wherever they are around the world.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"time america finally scrap lengthy transition period","story":"It will be 70 days tomorrow since the American presidential election 67 since the major television networks declared Joe Biden the winner. By now, bar the most conspiracy-addled of Congress-stormers, most Americans can agree that whether they like it or not, it will a Democrat who will take to the dais on Inauguration Day to be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States.  Tomorrow also marks 50 days since the Donald Trump appointee Emily Murphy, head of the General Services Administration, the body that supports the functioning of the federal government, reluctantly and belatedly issued the “letter of ascertainment” naming Mr Biden as “the apparent winner”, the formal mechanism for triggering the transition process.In the United Kingdom, we are largely spared the laborious interregnum that is a presidential transition lasting between ten and nearly eleven weeks. It always feels longer, a tortuously drawn-out affair known semi-officially as “lame duck”, characterised at best by stasis and at worst, as we are now witnessing: confusion and chaos.The US is rare among major democracies to hobble itself with such a lengthy transition. Only Mexico, at five months, is longer. France keeps the transition between Presidents of the Republic to a crisp 10 days. British transfers of power are brutal affairs, the packing vans line up at the back of 10 Downing Street as the new Prime Minister walks through the famous black door. Even the hung parliament of 2010 took only a few days of wrangling before the Coalition Government was formed.Yet it could be worse – presidential terms were originally designed to begin in March, to give state Electoral College electors enough time to make the long journey to Washington DC in the height of mid-winter. With the advent of speedier modes of transportation, the time was cut in half under the 20th Amendment to the Constitution in 1933. These days, with even Hawaii no more than a nine-hour flight from DC, and central heating guaranteed throughout, the length of the transition feels increasingly like wasted time.True, President Trump’s two-month sulk is making this current US transition particularly endless and unedifying. But a glance at American history shows painful transitions are not uncommon. Seven states seceded from the Union during the transition from James Buchanan to Abraham Lincoln in 1861 Buchanan refused to use the military to stop them, meaning Lincoln was plunged into Civil War within a month of his inauguration.  During the Great Depression, incoming President Franklin D Roosevelt rejected his predecessor Herbert Hoover’s offer to work together to agree a federal programme to steady the financial markets and help the millions out of work. While FDR is lauded for getting America back on its feet following the Depression, his intransigence, borne out of personal antipathy for Hoover, delayed the recovery by months, during which hundreds of banks failed and millions went hungry.Bill Clinton’s team famously trashed the West Wing during the transition to George W Bush, graffitiing the lavatories and removing the “Ws” from the keyboards, causing $15,000 of damage along the way.President Bush was so determined not to repeat this ungraciousness, he ensured the transition to Barack Obama was exemplary, working with his one-time rival to agree a bailout for the car industry during early days of the financial crisis. Mr Obama followed his lead, announcing the day after President Trump’s victory that he would do everything in his power to ease the transition, and inviting his successor to the White House. The tradition has stopped with Trump. The President has refused to concede, blocked Mr Biden’s access to national security briefings, failed to cooperate on tackling the pandemic, stoked his supporters into insurrection and generally acted as an impediment to the smooth transfer of power.Much of the problem is administrative unlike Britain, which has a neutral civil service to smooth the transition, an incoming US president must name more than 4,000 appointments, many of whom need Senate approval.Calls for an earlier start to the process collide against the reality that most campaigns will not spend valuable time, energy and money on something they can put off until after the election.The answer must be to either make many more offices politically neutral, or to make it normal practice for the first weeks of a presidency to be devoted to the functions that currently take place during a transition preferably both.In the most powerful nation of the world, the peaceful transition of power should not be at the whim of a capricious president.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter proves dont actually like encountering people different","story":"There was a time when we thought if we could just all communicate with one another, across the world, person-to-person that the world would be immeasurably better – we’d lose our doubt and suspicion and gain a real understanding of our shared humanity and our shared value. Such was the idealism when communications technologies started to make this vision sound possible that it was enshrined in the mottos of the institutions of the new radio era: “Nation shall speak peace unto nation” remains the motto of the BBC to this day.Technology in the 21st century has delivered on the vision of a global conversation in a way that radio waves never could. We now have a platform that creates a common ground where everyone from world leaders, to the pope, to ambassadors, journalists and the man or woman in the street can share their ideas on virtually any topic.The problem is that platform is called Twitter – and few if any of us feel as if that particular social network is about to foster a new era of world peace.The reflexive reaction is to blame the technology companies themselves. There’s certainly a good case to make against them – they often seem almost painfully out of touch to the problems their networks cause, they moderate content too little and too late, and for years they provided a platform to Donald Trump to incite all sorts of actions against his political enemies saying they could take no action against a sitting President – until they could.On top of the many legitimate criticisms to be levelled against Twitter and other tech giants comes an idea that it is their algorithms and the way they display their posts that are polarising us: they are creating so-called “filter bubbles”, exposing us only to views that we agree with until our endless scrolling radicalises us into an extreme version of our offline selves.This is possible, though the theory is not backed up by any kind of strong evidence. But there’s a simpler alternative explanation which seems to better fit reality: Twitter and social media isn’t iding us because it pushes us further apart. It’s iding us because it brings us closer together.Before the internet, it was easy to imagine that whatever opinions we held were probably shared by most people – or at least would be if we could only have chance to persuade people of them. We rarely knew what our neighbours thought of the political issues of the day – we often wouldn’t know what our extended family actually thought about immigration, gay rights, abortion, or numerous other issues. On top of this, many of our usual rules of social etiquette meant we would rarely discuss those topics.Now, we can debate and share any issue with anyone in real time – and we’ve discovered lots of people disagree wildly with us and will not be persuaded by our most reasonable arguments. The result is we quickly get frustrated, then angry, then find we’ve lost 12 hours shouting at a stranger – or our problematic uncle – on the internet.We like to say that the internet is pushing us apart. Instead, it’s pulling us together – and that, in itself, might just be the problem. The internet has delivered on the dream it promised us: man can speak unto man. It’s out fault, not the technology’s, that this has turned out to be something of a nightmare.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine super hubs roll causes mass confusion pensioners asked","story":"Moira Edwards was woken at 6am on Monday morning by a call from her son. He had managed to book her a last-minute vaccination slot. She’d have to go quickly, though – the jab was at a new mass injection centre half an hour away. Chaos reigned on Monday as thousands of over-80s travelled far and wide to receive coronavirus vaccinations at one of seven new super injection centres opening around the country. Mrs Edwards, 88, was one of 130,000 elderly and vulnerable people who received a confusing letter over the weekend inviting them to make an appointment, with many left distraught as they were invited to centres up to 40 miles away. The letter – 500,000 more of which are currently on their way to people – failed to make clear that anyone who preferred not to travel to a super centre could still receive the vaccine at a later date via their GP. Mrs Edwards had barely been within two metres of her family for months, but her daughter-in-law donned a mask, raced over and drove her to the centre so that she could receive the first dose of the day. In Shropshire, letters were sent to people aged 80 or over inviting them to super-centres as far away as Manchester. Pamela Harvey, an 83-year-old retired secretary, received a letter advising her to book a vaccination in Birmingham, 34 miles away from her Telford home. It sent her into “self-destruct mode”, her son told The .“My mother is 83 and she’s extremely vulnerable,” said Tony Clayton.“She hasn’t got internet, so she couldn’t sign up. She couldn’t possibly get to Birmingham on her own. And if I drive her, we’re both putting ourselves at risk.”Mr Clayton was among many who raised concerns that elderly people could catch the virus while queuing up. “It\u0027s surely not a good idea for my Mum to go into one of these centres where people might have Covid,” he said. Shaun Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin council, said the “shambolic episode” had left people distraught over the weekend. “A lot of these letters were going to people in their 80s and 90s with significant health issues, many with dementia who were completely confused by this coming out of the blue,” he said. “People thought this was their only opportunity. People were on the phone to me over the weekend in tears, thinking that they just couldn’t get to Manchester.”Elsewhere, GPs slammed the launch of the new centres as “a pr exercise”, and told how invitations had been sent to patients who had already been vaccinated or who had GP appointments booked.“The problem is that the system the mass vaccination centres are using and a system called Pinical that GPs have are not yet aligned”, said one GP, who asked not to be named. “I think this is very much a PR exercise. The only thing stopping GPs inoculating their patients currently is supply. These centres are just taking away vaccine from one part of the system and redistributing it to another.” There was some suspicion the centres were being used to disguise the fact that UK vaccine supplies were low, or to increase the perceived “offer” of vaccines rather than the actual delivery of them. However, sources at the Department of Health said the letters would not count towards the February target unless people successfully booked appointments at the super centres. Dr Helen Salisbury, a senior GP and academic in Oxford, said the thinking behind the new centres was “a mystery”. “The issue as far as GPs are concerned is vaccine supply. We have no problem vaccinating our patients, particularly with the Oxford AstraZeneca one.”She added that while these centres may make sense for the young, GPs were much better vaccinating older, more vulnerable groups.“It’s going to be a complete disaster. For our very frail and elderly, to make them travel, and to make them meet with lots of other people in a big centre, which is likely to have queues and crowds.” At Epsom Downs Racecourse, far from any form of public transport, elderly people pulled into the cold car park throughout the day, either driving themselves or being driven by masked relatives. Some waited in the cold for more than an hour. Keith and Tricia Barker took a 76-mile round trip from Buckinghamshire so that Keith, 85, could get his jab. Mr Barker was relieved to be vaccinated, but told the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who visited the centre on Monday morning, that it wasn’t realistic to expect elderly people to queue in the cold. “There was a queue building of 50 people to go in, some sitting in wheelchairs, standing out in the cold. People who are 80 plus can’t cope with that.” One lady, who asked not to be named, drove her husband to the centre, saw him to the queue and then waited for over three hours for him to reappear. “It’s 1pm and I last saw him at 10am. I’m going to have to go in and look for him if he doesn’t appear soon.” A senior NHS source last night said 500,000 more letters due to be sent this week would be reworded to make it clear that people unable to make the journey would still be offered a jab by their GP.

There will come a moment when people bite the bullet and send the truck.Pete White, transport manager at Berkshire-based haulage firm Whites Transport Services, said his lorries are suffering major disruption, with journeys that previously took two days now taking up to five.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has been urged to intervene after Kirkella, the trawler which normally catches up to 10 per cent of all the fish sold in the UK\u0027s fish and chip shops, continues to be tied up in port waiting for new distant-waters fishing deals.The 100-strong crew of Kirkella are still waiting for negotiations to be completed with Norway and other countries. Kirkella, which can freeze up to 780 tonnes of cod and haddock on its trips, has been tied up in St George\u0027s Dock, Hull, since returning from its last trip at the beginning of December.In a letter to the Prime Minister, Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East, said he wanted to know the Government\u0027s plan to secure continued access to the quotas the UK has caught historically in the Norwegian Economic Zone (NEZ) in and around the Barents Sea.The MP said he also wanted to know about plans to secure access to the waters around Svalbard, Greenland and Iceland.Chief executive of UK Fisheries, Jane Sandell, said: Talks between the UK, the EU and Norway are only beginning now, and there is no certainty unless the Government seriously raises its game that we will get anything like the quota we need in distant waters that will make fishing economically viable for us.”A UK Government spokesman said: The UK has secured a Fisheries Framework Agreement with Norway and the Faroe Islands, which provides the legal basis for annual negotiations on fishing opportunities and potential access to each other\u0027s waters.Negotiations for fishing opportunities in 2021 will be concluded as soon as possible.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"anita rani join womans hour","story":"Anita Rani is to join Radio 4\u0027s Woman\u0027s Hour, the BBC has announced.She will present the Friday and Saturday editions of the programme, with her first broadcast being on January 15.Rani said: I\u0027ve long been a fan of Woman\u0027s Hour and admired the presenters who have hosted the show previously, so I cannot wait to become part of it myself as second presenter, alongside the brilliant Emma Barnett.I am really looking forward to getting to know the listeners and discussing issues that matter to them the most.Woman\u0027s Hour has always given a voice to people who may not be heard elsewhere and I want to continue that important tradition.

Chartwells is not the exclusive supplier of FSM across the UK.

But Sir Simon added more detail, saying it would be the end of April. He told MPs: This is a sprint to mid-February, and then it will be a sprint from mid-February through to the end of April to extend the vaccination to the rest of the higher risk groups.

The centres will be based in football stadiums, conference centres, hotels, theatres and similar venues and be accessed by a national booking system. The locations of the other  mass centres havenapost yet been revealed, and nor have exact dates when theyaposll be set up. There will also be  hospital hubs and , local vaccine sites, including GPs and some - but not all - community pharmacies.

Of the  local areas in England, have seen a rise in case rates, have seen a fall and two are unchanged. The list has been calculated by the PA news agency based on Public Health England data published on January  on the Governmentaposs coronavirus dashboard.  Cllr Graham Morgan, leader of Knowsley Council, said, The rate at which our figures are continuing to increase is a major concern. Clearly there are some in our community who are not taking this situation seriously. We have no option but to go back to basics and follow the rules as we all did in the lockdown in the first half of last year. Matthew Ashton, director of public health at Liverpool City Council, said: They are very concerning infection rates. Our rates have more than doubled in a week. Everybody needs to be strictly following the rules. Evenyou can do something, it doesnapost mean you should. In fact we have got a iant of the virus that is  to  per cent more transmissible, therefore our Covid security measures need to be  to  per cent stronger, and that is strict adherence to the rules.  Barking  Dagenham in London however continues to have the highest rate in England, with , new cases recorded in the seven days to January  - the equivalent of ,. cases per , people. This is down very slightly from ,. in the seven days to December . Newham, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from ,. to ,. with , new cases.

Amberley Rainey, from Wirral, spent £, on the renovations and is now reaping the rewards, with the home now worth £,. The -year-old says the three-bed house was a “real do-er upper” with a kitchen covered in damp and mould, with uneven floors. The décor wasn’t to Amberley’s taste either, with s-style powder blue anaglypta wallpaper and salmon pink curtains in one room. Having bought the property in December  for £,, Amberley has lived there for three years while slowly chipping away at the makeover. When the UK went into lockdown in March last year, Amberley, an office manager, was furloughed and finally had enough time to focus on the house. The glow-up of the home included merging the kitchen and dining room into an open-plan space and redecorating the bedrooms, lounge and bathroom, as well as working on the garden.The kitchen was completely ripped out and replaced with fresh white units – bought second-hand on eBay for £ – with wooden floor replacing the old black and white patterned floor tiles.The living room fireplace is perhaps the most impressive transformation, going from a dated black grate with a mahogany mantelpiece and cream patterned tiles to a stunning cream mantel with a black coal fireplace at the base. The bedrooms are also unrecognisable after Amberley completely redecorated two of them with on-trend wooden furnishings, with the third box room converted into a work space.Meanwhile, the garden was transformed using fresh paving slabs and pebbles leading to a seating area – right in the middle of a summertime sun-trap. Even the garage got the golden treatment, going from a standard storage space to a stylish laundry room. Amberley estimates the renovations would have taken two years’ worth of weekend work had it not been for her being furloughed. Thanks to her efforts, the property value has increased by £,. “I was drawn to nothing but the fact the house was so light and bright with good-sized windows,” Amberley told Jam Press. “Everything  was atrocious and, being a first-time buyer, I had no idea what lay ahead to improve it.  “I lived in the house for three years just trying my best to bear it by painting walls ‘for now’, but after saving some money I was able to start renovations – starting with the kitchen wall knock-through, which was done by a professional weeks before lockdown. “After lockdown happened, I was stuck with all the time in the world and knew I had to sort my act out, and got planning the rest of the renovations. “It really kept me busy to say the least. “My family are based in Devon and abroad so I didn’t see them at all but I used to call them for DIY tips and used YouTube a lot for decorating advice.”The structural work was the most expensive part, setting Amberley back £, to have a steel bar fitted for the kitchen diner knock-through, but she was otherwise able to cut corners. She said: “I knew the kitchen would take up a lot of my budget and didn’t want to spend a fortune on units via a high street brand which I’d be paying off each month. “I researched my options, which took forever, but in the end found a second-hand kitchen on eBay which belonged to a local family in Wirral who were upgrading their own kitchen. “I made the purchase for  units for £, which was a really risky move and meant having it fitted was challenging and the hardest part of the renovations – but so worth it in the end, and it means I’m not in kitchen debt.”  Although she had to battle damp walls, cavity problems, faulty electrics and uneven flooring, Amberley described working on her home during lockdown as a “huge blessing in disguise” that kept her mind preoccupied. She said: “Pre-lockdown, my le was all about work and seeing loved ones – then suddenly it became all about buying Polyfilla and drills. “Until  I didn’t know I would ever be capable of any form of DIY or decorating, it’s really been a matter of sink or swim.  “The very fact I didn’t do it before lockdown shows how little time I had and how much of my le was taken up by other things. “It’s now become a hobby as I refine the finishing touches.” Amberley now plans to take a well-deserved break from renovating. She added: “There’s always something to do and the list keeps growing, but for the most part it’s all done.

Images of empty shelves in one of the major food chains, reminiscent of shocking scenes from last yearaposs first lockdown have emerged. The pictures of inside a Tesco in Cambridge yesterday showed swathes of food in the frozen and fresh sections completely emptied of stock. Shoppers were also spotted outside a supermarket carting out huge quantities of products including one woman seen with dozens of loaves of bread and cleaning products. Is your supermarket suffering from empty shelves  Email webnews@mirrorLast week Sainsburyaposs said it had temporarily limited access to its online groceries service at the start of the new lockdown to manage high demand for slots and updates customers were making to existing orders. Tesco said at the time bosses were holding discussions to review the item limit for online baskets, as well as product restrictions across popular items such as toilet rolls, antibacterial wipes and pasta.The new pictures come as many supermarkets begin to tighten their own rules in response to the coronavirus pandemic with masks being made compulsory and visitor numbers limited. In a message to customers the chief executive of supermarket giant Sainsburyaposs Simon Roberts said: I have spent a lot of time in our stores over the past few days and I need to ask for your help with two key issues to keep you and all my colleagues safe. When shopping in our stores, you must wear a mask or visor unless you have a medical exemption, and you should also shop on your own. Thanks you for your support. He added that security guards will be at the front of stores and will aposchallenge customers who are not wearing masks or who are shopping in groups.apos Customer numbers will also be apossignicantly reducedapos to ensure social distancing.  Morrisons had already banned all shoppers without face masks as the supermarket chains began to toughen up their rules.Last week the Mirror reported how panic buying had begun once again at the beginning of the third lockdown.Pictures then showed shelves looking bare and shoppers leaving with trolleys piled high with ious items.

Englandaposs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has warned the NHS faces the “most dangerous situation” in living memory, with record deaths and hospital admissions as a result of the virus.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer believes lockdown rules “may not be tough enough”, while Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said existing measures might have to be tightened further.With talk of even stricter lockdown rules possible, how much harsher could restrictions get  From alcohol bans and curfews to allowing men and women out on alternate days, here is how other countries have got tough with Covid-... China   Chinaaposs quick and heavy-handed response to Covid infections has helped bring the virus under control. Today another lockdown in Beijing, after the discovery of a handful of new cases, imposed strict measures on more than half a million people. Residents in the Shunyi district of Beijing will be under “closed management” - meaning they will be barred from leaving their residential compounds until everyone has been tested. In other lockdowns in China, only one member of each household was permitted to leave their home every couple of days to collect necessary supplies. Cyprus Could the UK be doing more to fight coronavirus  Let us know in the comments sectionCypriots, who entered a second nationwide lockdown on Friday, are only allowed out of their homes twice a day for essential travel or exercise, while schools and non-essential businesses are closed. People wanting to leave their homes for exercise, shopping, work or emergencies need to obtain prior approval by mobile text message. A daily pm to am curfew, introduced in November, remains in place. Japan On Friday Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared a month-long state of emergency for the capital Tokyo, during which time bars and restaurants must stop serving alcohol by pm and all businesses must close by pm. A nighttime curfew also means people must not not leave their homes after pm. Malaysia  Malaysia today announced strict new curbs in more than half the country to fight a coronavirus surge.Only two people per household are allowed to go out to buy groceries, and they can only travel within a kmradius from home. Argentina  A nationwide ban on driving between pm and am was announced last week in Argentina in an attempt to halt a new spike in infections. Last year’s lockdown in the capital Buenos Aires, from March  to November , was the world’s longest, with schools and businesses shut and tough penalties for anyone who couldn’t justy being outside. People over  were required to carry a special permit to circulate around the city, which was only valid for one day. Permissions were only granted for the collection of pensions or for medical treatment. South Africa  South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa announced an extension to the country’s coronavirus restrictions today. They include a curfew from pm until pm, the closure of all beaches and swimming pools, and a controversial ban on the sale of alcohol which was in place for much of last year, leaving the country’s winemakers with million litres of unsold wine. South Australia  Australia’s state of South Australia imposed one of the toughest ever lockdowns in November after a cleaner in a quarantine hotel in Adelaide infected  other people. The state-wide measures meant that most people weren’t allowed to even step out of their homes, not even for exercising or walking their pets. Only one designated family member was allowed to leave the house, and only once a day for essential work. Peru  Peru had one of the longest lockdowns with some of the harshest restrictions in the world. With the military patrolling the streets, people were required to fill out an online form to obtain permission to leave home.

Lisa Allison, , from Nottinghamshire, created her dream home on a budget after buying the property last October. The media and digital specialist decorated the house in stunning soft furnishings after getting to work on DIY projects including knocking down walls and re-designing bathrooms. Speaking about the incredible transformation, Lisa said: I bought my home for a good price due to all the work it needed, so I knew that by doing it up I would add some value, but I was surprised by how much. “I thought that I may just cover my costs, but an estate agent has informed me that the renovations have added around £-£k to the property’s value. “I’m over the moon with the result. It means that down the line, when I do sell up, I will have that extra money, my deposit and any equity I have built up in the home as my reward.” Lisa started searching for a home in September last year - but said she never planned on purchasing a house that needed renovating. But after spotting the house in a perfect area and for a great price she immediately put in an offer.  Despite knowing the house was a big project to take on, Lisa said she thought the renovation would be easy- but was so wrong. She set about getting the whole house transformed in time for Christmas - and somehow managed to achieve her goal, despite only working at weekends for the first two weeks of the project. She then took two weeks off work to finish the new kitchen, decorate rooms including the master bedroom, living room, dressing room, conservatory and even garden.  Working am to pm - Lisa said it was a tough slog. Despite calling in professionals to help with kitchen fitting, Lisa tackled the tiling herself and fitted £ lino flooring in both the kitchen and bathroom. And her work didnapost just stop inside the home- she even created a stunning garden fitted with wooden decking. Lisa said: I love spending time in the garden and knew I needed a good decking area to unwind on.  I like having BBQs, so I wanted an entertaining space – even though I’m yet to host due to the pandemic. Lisa extended the existing wooden decking area with the help of her dad and was gted a secondhand wooden dining table and chairs by her parents. “They were green and brown and looked awful when I got them, but I gave them a lick of paint with Cuprinol Garden Shades, which is especially for outdoor furniture,” she says.

Charlie-Anne Bradburn, from Nuneaton, says when she bought the house the kitchen was outdated and falling apart and wasted no time in starting work to give it a much-needed update. She said she wanted to create a modern vintage style look with a touch of quirkiness, adding new cabinets, wall tiles, and an over-the-sink drainer. When it came to the floor, the -year-old says the dark tiles she had inherited were ready for the bin, but found replacing them would be costly as workers said the floor would also need re-leveling. Determined to find a more budget-friendly solution, Charlie-Anne stumbled across a fan group of Dizzy Duck Designs, giving top tips on using the companyaposs stencils to revamp tiling and walls around the house. She spent about £ on her floor makeover kit, knocking £ off the quote price, and got to work.  Morello Tile Stencil from Dizzy Duck Designs - £. for two Dazzle Me! paint from Frenchic for the base layer - £. Swanky Pants paint from Frenchic for the stencil design - £. Polyvine Heavy Duty Extreme Dead Flat Varnish - £. + VAT for one litre She told LatestDeals : Firstly, I filled-in all the chips in the tiles with some grout that I sourced from a family friend for free. It was nothing special and I winged this part to be completely honest but it worked out fine. The next day I sanded down the filled parts to give it a smooth finish and even it out. I then deep cleaned the whole floor, including the grout, with sugar soup using a scrubbing brush to ensure I had a clean surface to work from. Once this step was complete, I lightly sanded down the entire floor again to help prepare it for the paint. Charlie-Anne added four coats of Dazzle Me! paint, leaving two hours in between each to allow it to dry, and then got to work on the stencilling two days later. The hardest part was cleaning the stencils between applications, she said. This should be done after every third or fourth time it’s used so there isnapost any paint build-up. This helps to keep the design nice and crisp and prevents any bleeding.  It went smoothly and Charlie-Anne left it for two weeks before sealing it with the nish to protect it. She was delighted with the results, adding: Iaposm so pleased that I chose to do this. Frenchic paint is fabulous. It’s proving to be very hardwearing. I applied three coats of nish and so far – three weeks later – I’ve had no chips, even though Iaposve accidentally dropped pans and all sorts on it.

Anna said: “She was taking less and less, but revealed she did not know what drugs her daughter was ingesting, but believed one of them was a sleep aid that she took after becoming depressed over the split. A friend said she was taking Klonopin and Trazpsychiatrist for panic attacks and anxiety spells - however believed the drugs made her more depressed and even suicidal.  Police sources and shocked residents said the mum was visiting her friend in the building when she jumped.

The flattered NHS ambulance worker had complained about her weight to the driver – only for him to text her later to reassure her that ‘she’s not fat’.

He was outstanding.“I thought my goalkeeper Jack Hamilton deserves credit as well after making a great save in the first half.”The Dundee boss, however, wasn’t so complimentary about the penalty decisions given by referee Gavin Duncan that gave Bonnyrigg the lead twice.McPake said: “How the first one is a penalty, I’ll never know.“The second one, I don’t know. The first was nothing short of a disgrace.“We don’t want to take the shine off Bonnyrigg by complaining about penalties, though.“Their performance warranted a live game on TV so they could show why they are doing so well in their league and why the Lowland League is a good one.“It didn’t show the best of us, we know that.

However, scoring a late goal in a pulsating cup tie is something Afolabi has dreamed of his entire le.Speaking before it emerged he had been subject to vile racist abuse on social media, Afolabi said of his first-ever Scottish Cup tie: “It was a huge relief as we were in the last seconds of the game and I am delighted it went in.“I just want to kick on now at Dundee.“This is one of those games that I will remember for a long time. It is one of my first professional games and it is good to get a last-minute goal like that.“It is something you always dream of as a kid.“I am just glad it happened.”The Republic of Ireland U  international arrived at Dundee on loan from Celtic in September and has netted twice in his last two appearances from the bench to add to a strike against Morton earlier in the campaign.Afolabi joined Celtic from Southampton in August  and had a short spell on loan to Dunfermline in the Championship last season.At East End Park he netted twice in six games, making the -year-old’s entire senior career read five goals in  games.And he’s determined to add more during his temporary stay at Dundee as he looks to force his way back into the starting line-up.A hamstring injury has troubled him in recent weeks but now Afolabi is keen to kick on.“I just have to take every chance I get with both hands,” he added.“I am glad I am doing that at the moment and I hope to keep that going for the club, the team and myself.“The good thing about this team # there is competition everywhere.“We know we can get the best out of each other every week.“Osman Sow is a great striker and it is good to see him back in form after ing from injury at the start of the season.“It is good to learn from someone with his experience.“I am happy for him and I am happy for the team that he is in such great form.”Sow was also on target as he netted the winning goal after  minutes of the memorable cup clash.For the majority of the contest, however, it looked like the Dark Blues were heading for an embarrassing home exit.On the back of six matches unbeaten and an impressive victory over Hearts the previous week, Dundee were slow out of the blocks early on.And Bonnyrigg made them pay for their lethargy by enjoying the better of the opening half and deserving their half-time lead.Looking dangerous in attack, the Lowland League outfit created a gilt-edged chance early on as George Hunter ran through on goal only to see his fierce effort superbly stopped by Jack Hamilton in the home goal.And they got their reward after  minutes, though there was plenty of debate about the decision to award the penalty.Replays showed Rose left-back Dean Hoskins miss the ball in the area before connecting with Dundee defending Jordon Forster.The officials saw it as a foul and gave Currie the chance to add to his three spot-kicks in round one.After the break it became attack against defence as Dundee piled forward but found it almost impossible to find a way past in-form goalkeeper Mark Weir.Eventually the pressure told as Afolabi followed up yet another superb stop to force the ball over the line with  minutes on the clock.Mirroring the  minutes, the Dark Blues were sluggish in the opening period of extra-time and once more found themselves behind to a Currie penalty.And again it was a debatable decision.This time Dundee took just two minutes to reply with Lee Ashcroft powering a header home before Sow knocked into an empty net after Weir had once more kept a shot out, this time from Danny Mullen.Relief rang around Dens Park as the hosts booked their place in round three where they will host Premiership St Johnstone.And Afolabi says that is just reward for refusing to give up.He added: “We did very well to pull it back in the end after a slow start.“It was just good to get over the line in the end.“I always kept believing and when I came on, I knew I had a job to do.“Luckily I managed to get the goal to take the game to extra time and give us a chance to win it.“The main thing is we are in the next round.

I had a meeting with Ian Blackford for going into schools so it’s going good.“It just builds the name up a bit more and he could help me more in terms of getting in football clubs.“He literally said to me: ‘Anything at all I can do, I’ll help out with’.“He’s the first person I’ve spoken to of calibre and I didn’t want to push too much but he’s just so helpful.“It’s limited right now because of Covid but say in the future I have a school talk in Dundee, which is the aim, I’d love to take him along.“I’m surehe’s got the time, he’d be happy to do it. He’s brand new.”He continued: “The overall aim is to be in as many schools, sports clubs and youth groups as I possibly can.“I want to be in somewhere every day, every week talking to as many people as possible and, hopefully, in - years I can look back and think: ‘There’s a generation of teenagers who understood the dangers before they maybe started gambling’.“I want them to learn from me rather than being in thousands of pounds of debt, miserable and trying to solve it from there.“It’s a big problem in society nowadays which is still quite hidden.”After leaving organised football, Pettigrew spiralled into addiction and, at one point, had six-figure debts with the bookies.However, he’s turned his le around, becoming debt-free and focused on growing Gamtalk.Pettigrew said: “I started Gamtalk in September after being bad with gambling for years from when I was  until I was about .“I used to play for Morton and Kilmarnock when I was younger, just on youth forms, and then I ended up getting really bad with gambling.“It took a couple of years to get back from it because it ruined my le, to be honest.“When I got over that I always had the idea to start something up and just went for it.“I’ve got a couple more ambassadors lined up for next year – a woman footballer actually.“It’s good because people can relate to footballers and it’s good when people see somebody, particularly Lawrence, whose career is on the up.“It’s a great one to have early on but I’m going to get a woman on board as well because I’m trying to make sure people know it’s not just a male problem.”Pettigrew is also hopeful Shankland’s involvement can encourage fellow-footballers to feel safe speaking out about their problems.He believes players can be ‘very susceptible’ to developing a gambling habit and revealed he’s already had a few come forward with concerns.Pettigrew commented: “I’ve had the Instagram page since September and since then I’ve had footballers talking to me, maybe not about them directly, but pals in their team.“These guys are training until maybe pm and then they have their afternoon off and maybe some of them have some spare money.“I think they’re very susceptible to it, footballers.”BLETHER: My personal story of Dundee United legend Jim McLean’s generosity\" title\"#BLETHER: My personal story of Dundee United legend Jim McLean’s generosity# # Evening \"

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time. All walks are undertaken at your own risk. Please continue to adhere to current guidelines as set out by the government, exercise responsibly and use appropriate clothing and equipment for your chosen outdoor activity.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures a look back at 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the years which followed, that death toll rose by thousands as people succumbed to radiation sickness.Among those who died was Sadako Sasaki, a pupil at Hiroshima’s Noboricho Elementary School, who developed acute leukaemia  years after being exposed to the radiation.While she was in hospital, she was inspired by the Japanese tradition that suggestssomeone makes a thousand origami cranes, their wish will come true. Sadako’s final days were spent folding paper cranes # hoping she would recover.After her death, her friends swore to build a monument in her honour, and their efforts led to the Children’s Peace Monument. Today, children around the world send more than  tonnes of paper cranes to the monument – more than the combined weight of Little Boy and Fat Man .The paper cranes are recycled by Peace Minds Hiroshima and sent to children around the world with Sadako’s story, raising awareness of the need for peace and nuclear abolition.Blessing the crane sculpture, Fr Ronald quoted from Pope Francis# World Day of Peace statement: #How many resources are spent on weaponry, especially nuclear weapons, that could be used for more signicant priorities such as ensuring the safety of iniduals, the promotion of peace and integral human development, the fight against poverty, and the provision of health care.#Global problems like the present Covid- pandemic and climate change have only made these challenges all the more evident. What a courageous decision it would be to establish a #Global Fund# with the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, in order to permanently eliminate hunger and contribute to the development of the poorest countries.#Fr Ronald added: #On January , the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons will enter into force. This is a milestone on the road to peace.#The crane was gted to St Margaret’s peace garden by Pax Christi Scotland chairwoman Marian Pallister and crafted by Lochgilphead blacksmith Jack Campbell to remind us to continue to strive for peace, and as Pope Francis reminds us, #…to esteem the value and dignity of every person, to act together in solidarity for the common good, and to bring relief to those suffering from poverty, disease, slavery, armed conflicts, and discrimination#.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a creative blast from scotlands past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

During  nights, excluding Friday and Saturday, work will take place between pm and am with a mph convoy system in place.Work then moves on to a section of the A at Corrranbuie, Tarbert, scheduled to be resurfaced during four nights between Sunday February  and Wednesday February .Due to the narrow carriageway widths at this location, work will be undertaken using a full road closure for safety between pm and am each night. As there is no suitable ersion route available, amnesties will be provided at pm, pm, am, am and am, during which vehicles will be escorted through the site under a mph convoy. Motorists are encouraged to arrive in good time to ensure they are accommodated within the amnesty period.Next it will be a section at Clachan between Thursday February  and Monday February  # three nights, excluding Friday and Saturday nights.As at Corranbuie, work will be undertaken using a full road closure between pm and am each night with amnesties at pm, pm, am, am and am each night, when traffic will be escorted under a mph convoy. Drivers are encouraged to arrive in good time.Over two nights from Tuesday February  to Thursday February  a section at Meall Mhor will be resurfaced, also using a full road closure between pm and am each night. Amnesties through the site will be provided at pm, pm, am, am and am each night when traffic will be escorted under a mph convoy. Again, drivers are advised to arrive in good time.Access for emergency services through the works sites will be maintained at all times.At all locations traffic management will be removed outwith working hours, but a temporary mph speed limit will remain in place, as traffic will be travelling over a temporary surface.Strict physical distancing protocols, in line with Scottish Government Covid- guidance, will be in force to protect teams and ensure they remain safe at all times.Eddie Ross of BEAR Scotland said: #This surfacing project across these four locations on the A will help address any defects and greatly improve the surface for motorists.#The overnight closures are essential for ensuring the safety of road workers and motorists due to the narrow widths of the road at these locations.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many people will have been blessed by her words over the years. Our thanks go to her at this time.We are all pleased to see the end of . A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.”A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honours"},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"meet kintyres heroic davids","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

But as it got dark the moon came out and Peter saw strange shapes on the hillside. They were moving slightly and he couldnrsquot decide what they were. It seemed they were crawling towards him. It wasnrsquot a wolf but he became very scared.So he blew the horn as hard as he could. He heard the sound of shouting and running feet as his father and other villagers came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked Peterrsquos father.ldquoI donrsquot think they are wolves but therersquos something scary over there, he replied.

Irsquom angry and disappointed in you. Do not do that again.He left with the villagers and reminded Peter: ldquoBlow that horn only when there is a wolf.Peter felt angry and disappointed with himself. But now he understood that it was just the outline of the trees and bushes in the moonlight, so he wasnrsquot scared of the shapes anymore.He sat by the fire eating his supper. It was a warm, cosy fire and it made him miss home and his family. His father had always told him that the warmth of a fire was for sharing, but he had no one to share his with. His head began to fill with stories and riddles, but there was no one to share these with either.He wasnrsquot scared anymore but Peter began to feel lonely. He had the sheep but they couldnrsquot solve riddles or listen to stories like his younger siblings, or sit with him by the fire and share its warmth. The fireside was always a place where his father told stories and his mother sang. Now he was alone and sadness overcame him. Hersquod never felt lonely like this.So he picked up the horn and blew it as loud as he could. Once again, the sound of shouting and running feet was heard as Peterrsquos father and his neighbours came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked his father.Peter looked down at the ground: ldquoWell, therersquos is no wolf, father, itrsquos just I was so lonely by the fire all by myself and...But he didnrsquot get the chance to explain. ldquoThere is no wolf  said his father angrily. ldquoI can hardly believe you have called us up here once again for nothing!Peter looked down at the ground and apologised, and promised he wouldnrsquot call them for nothing again. His father and the neighbours ed to the village in an unhappy mood.Peter settled down by the fire once again but this time he heard growling and when he looked up there really was a wolf. So he blew the horn as hard as he could. But there was no sound of shouting and running feet. So he blew again. Still nothing.So he shouted ldquowolf, wolf! in between blowing the horn, but his cry of wolf was ignored, because his father and the villagers didnrsquot believe him.The wolf seemed to understand the opportunity and so ate or killed all the sheep.rsquoSo the story ended.

painting scenes from his home town and from Gullane, Dirleton and the Bass Rock, ranging from the castle ruins of the mighty to the humble cottages of the poor.Since he also liked Dunbar, not less than  of his postcards are from this East Lothian coastal town, which was popular among the tourists in Edwardian times.Some of his cards depict standard sights like the Castle Ruins and the Town Hall one has a quaint little cottage at Cleikum Toll and another the Loverrsquos Walk, a rump of which still exists.One of his most interesting cards , from a historical point of view, depicts the ancient Abbey Ruins at Friarscroft: they were quite a rural scene in Edwardian times, with sheep grazing and some old cottages in the background.This Trinitarian abbey was founded by the Countess of Dunbar in , as one of eight known houses to have been located in Scotland.The abbey still stood in  but it fell into a gradual decline the remaining friars moved away, and most of the stoneware of the church was taken away for local building projects.A  map shows that by this time, only the tower stood, being used as a dovecot.In , a group of archaeologists and antiquaries made excavations near the dovecot tower, finding the original tiled floor of the church, but no trace of an original dwelling-house for the friars anywhere nearby.Since the old friars had built their tower sturdy and strong, it still stands today , looking virtually unchanged since Phillimorersquos time.The only sheep to be found anywhere in the vicinity are the lamb chops for sale at the Co-op supermarket, although the cottages in the background remain more or less unchanged.Friarrsquos Walk, also known as the Monkrsquos Walk of Dunbar, is a more mysterious matter.This structure is still largely in existence, consisting of two parallel ancient sandstone rubble walls stretching southwards from West Port.It has been presumed that Friarrsquos Walk must have some connection with the Trinitarian abbey, and that the part connecting it with West Port is a later addition.The northern part of Friars WalkAlready in Victorian times, Friarrsquos Walk was used to dump rubbish and garden refuse from the gardens of the houses on High Street, but the entirewas passable within living memory.When examined by the archaeologists in , it was largely filled with earth and quite overgrown when I explored it in , things had not improved in the slightest.What might have been, through the deployment of a sergeant-major and  unemployed youngsters armed with shovels and saws, one of the leading tourist attractions of Dunbar has been left to fight a losing battle against decay.There does not appear to be any other instances of ancient double walls with a narrow walkway between them, and the Dunbar local historians have speculated what use had been made of Friarrsquos Walk in olden times.One rather adventurous hypothesis is that the Trinitarian monks used the walls as a walkway from their abbey to another building, perhaps their dwelling-house.When ended at its southern extremityby the construction of a Georgian or early Victorian building, Friarrsquos Walk is heading straight for what is today the

the board and the joint response group as we have watched the new strain of the virus spread rapidly.ldquoWhile national sport has been afforded the privilege of elite sporting exemption, the risk of mass transportation of untested, largely part-time players is something that cannot be sustained as the cases continue to rise and available hospital beds become increasingly scarce.ldquoAfter discussions with the SPFL, the Premiership and Championship will continue on the proviso that both adhere to the existing testing regime.ldquoThe vast majority of teams in those isions are full-time professional clubs and so the risk of transmission remains manageably low.ldquoThe cost implications to lower-ision clubs was one factor but so too the realisation that many ndash with some notable

In , a century ahead of schedule, Henry VIII splits with the Roman Kemite Temple and forms an Anglican one then in  therersquos a Flash War in which the original city of Dinium is obliterated.The Dinium of May , when the novel opens, consists of an Outer City and an Inner City which contains The Ark, an apparent sanctuary built in  and to which Outer City residents can movethey qualy .

Her horns hidden in a tumult of hair, she walks along Constitution Street towards a city that is dark and unheimlich a city populated by beggars, glowering gargoyles and men of the cloth who swoop down the High Street like crows. The year is , but it is an Edinburgh Kidnappedrsquos David Balfour would instantly recognise: a place of hubbub, and of tenements, both multi-storeyed and multi-storied, ldquostanding sentinel around the Tron.In recent years, Edinburgh has plied a trade as a backdrop for the crime novels of Ian Rankin and others. But Fagan plays up the cityrsquos Gothic traits to produce an instant classic. Suffused with dread, Luckenbooth is a perverse love song to its castle and its catacombs its plague victims and its Presbyterianism its hedonism and its haar.The ghost of Robert Louis Stevenson stalks its narrative wynds. Deacon Brodie ndash respectable cabinet maker by day housebreaker by night ndash is the inspiration for Luckenboothrsquos villain Mr Udnam just as he was for Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Fagan acknowledges the debt. She has Flora ndash a trans woman at a sex party ndash remind us that Stevensonrsquos most famous novel was written during a six-day cocaine binge. And Luckenbooth possesses that same frenetic energy the same fever-dream quality found in her debut, The Panoptican, about a teenage girl in care. It is asall the images in Faganrsquos head are engaged in a breathless, deathless race on to the page. References to Hitler, druids, pagans and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse snap at each otherrsquos heels. Witches and assassins, madams and mediums jostle for their place in a universe which, while anchored in a familiar geographical literary landscape, moves to its own wild beat.The Luckenbooth of the title ndash No  Luckenbooth to be precise ndash is a nine-storey building in the heart of the Old Town. It is named after the lockable booths for traders ndash luckenbuiths ndash which stood nearby, but a luckenbooth is also a silver brooch sometimes worn to ward off witches. This is ironic because the tenement is cursed. Jessie has been sold as a surrogate mother to wealthy landlord Mr Udnamrsquos baby. The atrocity that follows works its way into the fabric of the building, rising like damp through its floors, infecting its eccentric residents over the course of almost  years.Faganrsquos conjuring of the tenement is an incredible feat. She creates a literary Windows in the West, providing fleeting glimpses of self-contained worlds: a man at his piano a parrot flying round a room. But more than that, she captures the ebb and flow of humanity, the way we weave in and out of each othersrsquo lives, barely touching.There are the daily routines: ldquoA kettle whistle goes on a stove on the fourth floor each day at am, am, pm and then again at pm, Levi, a black American, who works in the Royal Dick veterinary building, writes to his brother in . But there is also a fluidity, an overlapping of existence the living moving in tandem with the dead. Leitmots create connections. Jessie has a cage around her heart made of ldquobone, bone, bone, Levi sorts animal bones ldquonumerically by size and species, and the tenement has access to the vaults where body-snatchers Burke and Hare once wheeled their victimsrsquo bodies.Like all great Gothic works, Luckenbooth deals in duality: good evil, light dark. The more sins Mr Udman commits, the more philanthropic he becomes. Jessie has her fatherrsquos horns, but stands up against the landlord. Flora has changed from male to female, but is still caught in a biological trap. Copious mind-altering drugs are consumed and sex is had in an impressive range of numerical gender combinations.This duality extends to the setting. Fagan builds on the idea of there being two Edinburghs, ldquoone above ground and one below, one in the centre and one on the outskirts. This duality can be thrilling. ldquoSometimes the sky races in such a way it seems there are two skies from two dferent worlds entirely ndash rushing at each other in opposite directions, layers of cloud and dark moodiness, Levi writes.The lust extends to the setting, too. Fagan comes at Edinburgh like a voracious lover, eager to explore both its conspicuous beauty and its secret places. She runs the gamut of its sinister hotspots: Greyfriars Kirkyard, the execution site on the Grassmarket, the notorious Pubic Triangle. But that is not enough. She wants us to see the city from every angle, in every light, so she sends Flora up the Salisbury Crags. At sunset ldquothey look like they are on fire, Flora says. ldquoThe entire thing turns rose gold.From the top she can see the ldquowhole city skyline sparkle before her. Just as in The Sunlight Pilgrims ndash which features a frozen dystopian near-future in the Highlands ndash Faganrsquos writing sparkles most when she is describing landscape. But she also crams Luckenbooth full of legends. She tells of Robert the Brucersquos heart, cut out so it could be taken to the Holy Land, and of Baska Murmanska, the polar bear mascot of a First World War Polish battalion, led through Leith by war-weary soldiers. Now and then, she tries too hard, and the stories begin to stack up like supermarket BOGOFs but mostly her vivid descriptions keep everything fresh.Luckenbooth is a horror story, originally and beautully told. But it is also a paean to the city Hugh MacDiarmid described as a ldquomad Godrsquos dream. This quote is the bookrsquos epigraph, and Fagan serves it well. Indeed, so fully has she fleshed out MacDiarmidrsquos vision, she may have ruined Edinburgh as a location for Gothic novelists for many years to come."},{"url":null,"title":"susan-calmans-grand-day","story":"Susan Calmans Grand Day Out.Like Wallace and Gromit Kind of.

January . It is the day before the latest lockdown is announced and Francis is thinking about our lives under the shadow of the coronavirus about how his le and work has changed in the last  months and how everyone rsquos has too.Francis who is both a GP and an author has written Intensive Care, a book about what it was like to be a doctor in the first few months of a pandemic.In the past he has written about his love of islands , his time spent in Antarcticaand about medicine and human change inthe award-winning Shapeshters. ldquoI make sense of the world through writing about it, he explains.In Intensive Care he charts his experiences in , in both an inner-city GPrsquos practice in Edinburgh and his short time spent as a doctor up on Orkney.The result, as he writes in the introduction, is an attempt at ldquoan eyewitness account of the most intense months I have known in my -year career.Define intense, Gavin  ldquoI was trying to keep my clinic going because Irsquom a GP partner with key colleagues in an inner-city practice. I was trying to manage the home-schooling of my children. I was managing a huge amount of uncertainty and stress among my patients, among my staff and my colleagues.ldquoAnd then, when I actually was seeing covid patients, the kind of measures we had to take were extraordinarily dficult to get used to the layers, the barriers, theof time it took to get all the PPE on and getall off again safely.ldquoIt just put huge pressure on the simple business of medicine, which is to see people in distress and attempt to ease their suffering. It was phenomenally complicated by the measures that we had to take. I suppose thatrsquos what I mean by intense, because everything was just laden with this stress and with this drama brought by the virus.Clearly, things are not getting better. We are entering this new year with coronavirus cases surging. Francis, like he has been for the last  months, is on the front line.ldquoItrsquos very, very dficult. Where Irsquom working in Edinburgh the hospitals arenrsquot full yet, like the scenes we are seeing in the south-east of England, but they are filling up.ldquoTherersquos a winter beds crisis every year, but this year is so much worse because wersquove got this terrible new respiratory virus to deal with on top of everything .There are a few small upsides, he says. There has been a lot less flu around this winter than normal as a result of all our social distancing. Still, last week he got an email from NHS Lothian asking him and his colleague to do everything within their power to try and prevent admitting patients to hospital.Read More: Grief in a time of pandemicThatrsquos an annual request, he says. However, he adds, ldquoWersquore having to contemplate shutting down routine care yet again. Wersquore becoming a national covid service at the moment.To think back to last January and February now is to recall another world. We lived in a pre-pandemic world and it took us all a while to realise how much was changing. As a GP, Francis and his colleagues had to completely rethink how to deliver care, how to organise their daily practice of medicine. It was a tricky transition.ldquoWe were forced into trying to manage things on the phone because we had no option. Ordinarily my training would tell me you should always see people face to face.Francis had a front-seat view of the spread of the virus. In the book he points out that that last February and March he was very quickly aware of how rapidly the virus was spreading, more rapidly than the government, health boards and the chief medical officer seemed to be acknowledging at the time.ldquoI would hear stories that made me conscious of just how widespread the virus was in the city, Francis recalls. ldquoI was working up in Orkney in February before it had really hit and then, by the time we were into March, it was definitely spreading quite quickly when I was back in my usual practice.ldquoThe government knew that, but I think this was such an unprecedented, explosive situation in terms of controlling the infection that at every stage it feels like the government couldnrsquot quite believe that they were going to have to go to these extremes.ldquoThey couldnrsquot quite believe that they were going to have to close down all the hotels, that they were going to have to shut down flights in and out of the city. At every stage, when it proved we had to do these things, there was an understandable and justiable reluctance to go that extra step, which subsequently proved necessary.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why I think every single Western country has struggled with this virus. The ones that have done pretty well with it in the Far East have got populations that are willing to tolerate a far greater level of state intrusion into their lives.ldquoCountries like the UK are not used to accepting that the state can just lock us up in our own houses for  days.ldquoWersquore not used to having to hand over our personal details every time we visit a pub or a restaurant. Wersquore just not used to that level of state intrusion.Intensive Care is a cool, thoughtful book, and not one, it should be said, particularly interested in blame. ldquoNo, not at all. Itrsquos very easy to look back retrospectively. At every stage I was quite incredulous too. lsquoAre they are really going to have to close all the schools  Are they really going to have to ban flights rsquoWhat he hopes is,this happens again, we will be quicker to close borders and quicker to ramp up mass testing.ldquoGoing forward from this pandemic I think government will be a lot better at keeping pandemic stocks of PPE up to date. Ours had all started to go out of date because they had been stockpiled for the swine flu of .ldquoWe did have access to masks, aprons and so on. We didnrsquot have gowns and the WHO were advising people to wear full gowns.One of the most striking revelations in Intensive Care is how quickly Francis and his colleagues were dealing with a surge in mental health problems as lockdown began. ldquoOne day,  March, almost everything I dealt with related to mental health, he writes.Thatrsquos just two days after Boris Johnson announced a lockdown, I say.ldquoIt was happening so fast, partly because I am in in the city centre of Edinburgh and so much of the economy of that part of Scotland is devoted to tourism. Therersquos a lot of guesthouses there, a lot of people who depend on tourists. And suddenly that was all blown away.ldquoSo, I was seeing the effects of people not just coming to terms with a very dangerous, le-threatening pandemic infection, but also the collapse of their businesses, especially at that time when it wasnrsquot clear what the economic support measures would be. There was a real sense of terror among people who were furloughed or even under threat of redundancy. The uncertainty of that, combined with being ordered to stay home on the pain of essentially risking your le.The impact on our mental health led Francis to join a number of doctors and nurses in writing a letter to education secretary John Swinney to try to get children back into schools.ldquoYou could see the government was doing everything it could to avoid a measurable harm, which was covid deaths among adults because that is a statistic that would be on the front of every newspaper. A terrying statistic. But there were innumerable, less measurable harms still being perpetrated.ldquoI donrsquot envy the politicians making these choices, but, essentially, because the deaths were measurable, everything was done to mitigate that. But there were enormous harms being done by keeping the kids off school, by enforcing everybody to stay home, by the shutdown of massive sectors of the economy. Thatrsquos before we get on to the enormous harm done to the elderly people told to shield and to be away from anybody, to not see their grandchildren for month after month after month. And Irsquom seeing real outcomes of that now, after almost a year of this.ldquoPeople in their late eighties and nineties are saying, lsquoYou know, I might not have many years left and to avoid seeing the people who make my le most worthwhile for so long has been truly terrible, truly dficult.rsquoThe impact on our mental health can also be seen in the rise this last  months of cases of self-harm, panic attacks, and psychosis ndash all, Francis says, on the rise in his own practice.Itrsquos a reminder, I suggest, that being human is about contact and without it we are damaged.ldquoAbsolutely and one of the cruellest aspects of this virus is it spreads through touch and through voice. Singing was one of the worst ways of spreading the virus. Wersquore told to mask up to not touch each other. Itrsquos kind of like an attack on the most basic elements of our humanity.Wersquore being urged to resume clapping for our ldquoheroes again. Francis quite enjoyed the clapping that accompanied the early weeks of the lockdown. Not all of his colleagues felt the same, though.ldquoSome of them hated it. I didnrsquot so much like the clapping, but I really liked the opportunity to chat with my neighbours. If I happened to be home on a Thursday evening and all the neighbours were out on the street, it was quite nice to see each other, four metres apart.ldquoAnd itrsquos interesting how much that amazing upwelling of good feeling towards key workers at that time has kind of dissolved now.Well, indeed. He talks about the scenes of covid-deniers gathering outside hospitals in England with utter incomprehension.ldquoWhat can we do to assure people it is absolutely not a hoax  People are dying of this and the ones that arenrsquot dying of it are very ill, sometimes for a long time. Irsquom not sure how  you can convince people. Itrsquos quite extraordinary to me that people can even deny it exists.Does that make you angry  ldquoNot so much angry. Irsquom absolutely mystied.What the pandemic has reminded us, Francis suggests, is that we are vulnerable. But also, of human ingenuity. ldquoThe ability to create several al vaccines within a few months of this emerging is tremendous, he says.ldquoOn the other hand, itrsquos quite startling to think we havenrsquot progressed in terms of how we best manage and control this kind of viral outbreak. I found that depressing in many ways. In some ways we havenrsquot moved on, for all our sophistication.And so here we are in January , somewhere between hope and fear. Francis leans towards the former. ldquoYeah, Irsquom really hopeful. Irsquom optimistic because we have two vaccines approved for use. Irsquove already had my first vaccination. Irsquom getting my booster later this week. Wersquore vaccinating care homes just now. Wersquore going to vaccinate the over-s very shortly.ldquoThat is the only way wersquore going to get out of this. Wersquore going to get herd immunity through vaccination rather than herd immunity through people having caught and recovered from it.ldquoOf course, it could have been better. Of course, I could point to things that have gone wrong over the last year. Now what wersquove got to do is stick with the measures and vaccinate, vaccinate, to get out of it.Gavin Francis is a GP.

On his watch Scotlandrsquos seabed has been turned into a ploughed field and our waters, once teeming with a bio-ersity of marine le, have become barren and a Klondyke for Big Fishing.Mr Ewing wonrsquot resign though, because Scottish ministers get to evade responsibility for failure and incompetence unless they are considered sufficiently junior and inconsequential to be thrown overboard. Joe Fitzpatrick discovered this recently when he was made to walk the plank for a decade of failure to address Scotlandrsquos drug crisis.John Swinney, despite a lamentable term as Education Minister, remains intact ndash even after last yearrsquos exams fiasco which exposed a class-based gerrymandering in Scotlandrsquos educational framework which always favours pupils from private schools and those in affluent areas.Lady Poolersquos judgment in favour of the Creelers followed the SNPrsquos rejection late last year of any attempts to curb the rapacious activities of driven grouse moors.

Remember those breathless claims of Alex Salmond a decade ago about Scotland becoming ldquothe Saudi Arabia of renewables Thankfully, for the Scottish Government, global and UK forces keep providing opportunities for it to avert our gaze. These also give them space to pivot away from anything radical about what Scotland will look like when it gains its independence.Boris Johnson last week bowled the SNP another gentle delivery to be swept away imperiously by a gleeful Nicola Sturgeon. The UK Prime Ministerrsquos claim that independence would have left Scotland without access to Covid- vaccinations can be set alongside some of Better Togetherrsquos most vivid fictions during the first referendum on independence.Just as ridiculous though, is the Scottish Governmentrsquos claim for billions in Brexit compensation. They know and we know itrsquoll never happen but it eats up valuable column inches that might otherwise be devoted to something more relevant to the real lives of Scots. An over-arching framework of grievance is being constructed here:only Scotland could be part of the EU we could do so many more things at home.Donald Trump and the Capitol Hill mob provided another  for ersionary tactics. When the outgoing President hinted that he might spend time at one of his luxury golf resorts in Scotland rather than attend the inauguration of his successor Joe Biden, Nicola Sturgeon wasted no time in responding. Since then our liberal and media elites have been exulting in a self-indulgent frenzy of sanctimony to explore ways of having his big velvet collar feltever he sets foot in Scotland. In the real world beset by unemployment, drugs deaths and the economic ravages of Covid they care not a jot about this middle-class caprice.Read More:Why the Nativity story belongs in the age of CovidNo matter, it seems, is too trivial for the Scottish Government to strike an unctuous pose.

In the next decade this will be observed in how those neighbourhoods will be required to take the biggest hit when the coronavirus account must be settled. The UK Labour Party has effectively removed itself from this struggle with the ascendancy of Sir Keir Starmer, the ultimate establishment plant. In Scotland, the SNP will simply frame all future challenges in alleviating the stress of poverty in terms of being ldquodragged out of Europe against our will.Already, right-wing and neo-liberal ideology is moving to position itself when independence finally comes.

The negotiations that led to the  treaty did not come about directly from the  election, they came about because of the war of independence it was the result not of a peaceful election but of violent action and any attempt to separate the Irish precedent from the violence, which is what Ms Cherry appears to be trying to do, is misleading and wrong.Letrsquos also look at another part of Ms Cherryrsquos commentary. ldquoNo-one wants to replicate the violence that preceded the negotiations, she says, and on the face of it thatrsquos a call for peaceful action. But itrsquos also anti-historical. There wasnrsquot just violence ldquopreceding Irish independence, the violence got worse as independence progressed and developed into years of terrorism. The story of Irish independence is the story of violent ision before, during, and after and there is simply no way of somehow removing or sidelining the violence so it can be used as a peaceful precedent for Scotland.If Ms Cherry needs reminding why Irsquom saying all of this, the recent House of Commons briefing paper, Parliament and Northern Ireland, -, provides useful context. Itrsquos written by the man who wrote this column for many years, David Torrance, and goes through the constitutional history of the island of Ireland in the greatest detail, underlining in the process how long, complex and violent it has been. It also makes the point that a lot of the early history has slipped from public consciousness, which may explain why Ms Cherry feels able to use it as a precedent for Scotland.So why does it all matter  It matters because the SNP is at the point where therersquos an internal battle going on over the best tactics for achieving independence and Ms Cherry is an influential figure in that battle. I would have thought that makes it extra important she gets her history right and thinks carefully about the consequences of using Ireland as a precedent for Scotland. I fear she hasnrsquot done so because of the flaw that runs through so many nationalists.Read more:The Scottish Government is not to blame for the drugs crisisWhat I mean is the idea that it couldnrsquot happen here. Ms Cherry doesnrsquot appear to consider for a minute that the debate in Scotland could ever erupt into violence, but are we sure of that  Many Americans thought the same way before the riots at the Capitol. The SNP MP Steven Bonnar also tweeted recently that ldquowe will fight to the death for our country and I guess your view on whether that sort of comment could ever lead to actual violence will depend on how literal you think Mr Bonnar was being. He said he was joking.I also think anyone who knows anything about the mood in Scotland should be cautious about thinking there could never be violence here in future. Many Scottish nationalists are furious that theyrsquore not getting their own way, but we should also be aware that Scotland has many of the same tensions as Northern Ireland for many of the same reasons: economic, religious, constitutional. The Loyalist bands are stronger and more vocerous in Scotland than ever. And therersquos already been violence. Remember the Glasgow riots in  when the Irish unity march was met by counter-demonstrators  And the arson attack on the Tall Cranes pub in Govan  What makes anyone think that sort of violence could never happen again, or get worse even What Irsquom saying is that the only responsible thing to do here is to make ourselves aware of the historical backdrop before we start suggesting that the answer to Scotlandrsquos future can be found in Irelandrsquos past. Perhaps Ms Cherry should also remember how her party got here in the first place. In her article for The National newspaper, she writes that the SNP is riding high and support for independence is at unprecedented levels, which it is. ldquoWe would never have got this far, she says, ldquohad we hellip not been prepared to be radical and to think outside the box.The obvious implication of Ms Cherryrsquos words is that nationalists need to be radical again and look to apparent alternatives to a referendum, such as Ireland. But the SNP hasnrsquot got here because of radicalism, itrsquos got here because of a wily ability to use every situation to maximise dference and grievance and underline the apparent need for independence ndash in other words, exactly the opposite of radical. Ms Cherry says it is foolish and dangerous to rule out alternatives to a -style referendum. But may I suggest that, from her point of view, it is just as foolish to ignore the reasons why the SNP has reached this historical high.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

There are plenty of instances where the person saying ldquoWhy should it be dficult just to do X  has a point, and the smart-alec saying ldquoItrsquos a bit more complicated than that is wrong. : Clap for heroes: I want to clap, I really do, but...I thought of this last month when someone made the mistake of writing a tweet along the lines of ldquoIf it were up to me, I would just roll the vaccine out more quickly and then had to spend the rest of the day explaining to hundreds of people whose replies began ldquoActuallyhellipthat it had been, you know, a joke.The more I think about it, however, the more I think he might have been on to something. The vaccines are the one undoubted triumph of the whole coronavirus episode it is extraordinary that they have been developed, assessed, approved and produced in such quantities in the time they have.Most of the credit should go to the scientists and pharmaceutical companies . But a good deal should also go to the government, civil service, and those brought in to manage procurement and delivery. Whatever  has been badly handled, which has been most things, the UK has so far got this right.Things are still terrible, of course probably worse than the first wave. Lockdown continues to be a necessity. Imagine, for a moment, though, what it would be likewe were where we are, but with no vaccine in sight.There is still the possibility that delivery of the vaccine, as opposed to having got one and lined up supplies of it, will be messed up. Indeed, that is the assumption of lots of pessimists. But I confess that my scepticism about the apparent confidence of the government and its advisors was slightly tempered by the fact that the NHS and public health experts ndash even those happy to slate politicians for other failures ndash seem united in the view that the ambitious timetable for actually getting the stuff into peoplersquos arms is, while a huge challenge, not especially unrealistic.If one looks at the track record of Israel, which has inoculated one fth of its population in less than three weeks, itrsquos clear that ndash assuming you have supplies of the vaccine ndash it can be delivered to an awful lot of people very quickly. And the one thing Britain has secured is sufficient supplies. Leaving aside tiresome, point-scoring claims that itrsquos the first clear benefit of Brexit, or any of that rubbish, it is a matter of fact that on this one issue, wersquove so far done better than any other European country ndash almost any country, full stop.: The Irish Border Sea exists, whatever Brandon Lewis saysBut thatrsquos no usewe fluff the delivery. Instead of assuming that the UK or Scottish Government will mess it up, or concentrating on what a huge logistical task it is, itrsquos worth looking at some of the ways in which it might be relatively straightforward, and even ways it could be quicker and easier. We will be constrained by the supply, but neednrsquot be by the logistics.We do a lot of things that involve large chunks of the population without much fuss already. Every election day, about half the population cast their votes somewhere fairly near their home in a few minutes, usually without queuing. The country is not short of community centres, schools, surgeries, libraries, sports stadia, leisure centres and other venues where people could line up, safely socially distanced.The numbers seem daunting, but think of this: , people can pour in and out of Hampden over a few hours Ibrox is as big, Celtic Park even bigger the SSE Hydro holds more than ,. Over a day or two, Glasgow alone could probably vaccinate a couple of hundred thousand people safely.Nor are we short of people qualied to handle it. Even without bringing in, say, the army, there is obvious capacity. Take the infrastructure that lies behind the booking of tickets and the stewarding and management of live entertainment: concerts, sports, festivals. These people handle hundreds of thousands of sales in a matter of hours, book time slots, line up staff. They shepherd enormous crowds around large venues.All those people ndash expert in just such large-scale events ndash are, as it happens, desperate for something to do, since their industries have been shut down.That shut-down is another consideration and why, for once, cost isnrsquot. Lockdown is probably, all told, costing the Treasury more than pound billion every day: last yearrsquos bill was about pound billion. If a substantial chunk of the population were to receive the vaccine by the end of March, someto normality and productivity is a possibility. No matter how much it costs to do this, it is almost certain to be a saving.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Sadly, they have been a particular feature of my experience in politics. Usually, they come from a position of ignorance from those who have never spoken with me and wish to distort something Irsquove said by taking it wholly out of context. I am afraid Mr Smithrsquos column yesterday was typical.It is clear that Mr Smith had not read properly or,he did, had not understood the original article written by me from which he selectively quoted. First, I explained that the ideal method for Scotland to become independent would be after a referendum based on an agreement between the British and Scottish governments as set out previously in the Edinburgh Agreement. Secondly, in the context of exploring whether there might be other legal and constitutional options, amongst other points I identied that there is historical precedent for a country exiting its union with England by a process of treaty negotiation after a majority of pro-independence MPs win an election. That is what happened when Ireland and England entered into the Anglo-Irish treaty in . As might be expected given the subject matter, I went out of my way to stress that no one would want to replicate the violence which intervened and that my reference was to the legal and constitutional precedent.It is of note that the , a newspaper which one might expect to be well acquainted with the matter, reported what I said accurately and without hyperbole or hysteria. I would respectfully suggest that Mr Smith might do well to aspire to their standard of journalism and commentary.If we canrsquot have broader intellectual discussion of political ideas without this sort of ill-informed backlash itrsquos not a good thing for Scottish public debate nor indeed for freedom of speech, of which I know your newspaper is a proud proponent.I set out in further depth some of the legal and constitutional options open to Scotland in my recent keynote address to the Cardf Centre for Governance which can be viewed in full at https:www.youtube watch vxzCGxLPQwU.There is much that is wrong with Mr Smithrsquos column in fact and tone, but my main objection is that in saying that there is a necessity to talk about me he has not taken the slightest trouble ever to speak with me or to properly acquaint himself with my background.Had he done so he would know that I am an Irish as well as a British citizen and as such well acquainted with my countryrsquos history. As the daughter of an Irish woman and of a historian, I was brought up to know and understand the history of Ireland, Scotland and indeed Britain. Accordingly, I donrsquot need an Irish history lesson from Mr Smith nor indeed a lecture on what parallels might or might not be drawn with Scotland.Mr Smith sought to accuse me of ignorance and distortion but that is in fact a charge that is more fairly laid against him for failing to inform himself of the subject about which he chose to write.I donrsquot expect an apology, but Irsquom pleased to put my position on the record.Joanna Cherry QC MP.A DEMOCRATIC AND PEACEFUL ROUTEMARK Smithrsquos article included Irish independence and is a topic well beyond the scope of single articles or letters and writers thereof have no choice other than to be selective. Mr Smith does this by discussing the violence which preceded the years running up to the  Irish election but not the causes of the violence and calls Joanna Cherry irresponsible for citing the Irish election of  as a route for Scottish independence, a sort of Plan B.Whilst acknowledging the violence, Ms Cherry was unwise to use Ireland as a comparator, and caution has to be exercised when discussing Irelandrsquos complex political history. Anyone with the most elementary knowledge of the background to Irelandrsquos independence cannot disassociate the accompanying violence. I do believe Ms Cherry was attempting to illustrate there is precedent for an alternative democratic method other than a referendum for voters to make their wishes known on Scottish independence. Absolutely no one can castigate the SNP leadership for seeking other than a democratic and peaceful route to Scottish independence.Irish unrest went back centuries but a major catalyst, among others at dferent periods of time, was the Famine or Irish Potato Famine starting in resulting in mass starvation with more than one million people dying and many emigrating and the population of Ireland falling by more than % in the period. Good crops continued to be exported across the Irish Sea and the plight caused in Ireland by the famine was largely ignored by Westminster despite many entreaties, until such time as the number of deaths meant it could be neglected no longer. The solutions to Irish problems continued to be ignored by Westminster and played no small part in the early th century history of Ireland.What then are the ways to Scottish independencethere is a clear democratic and sustained majority vote by the people toto being a sovereign country once again Alan M Morris, Blanefield.WE NEED A VELVET DIVORCEldquoA NATIONALIST view of history writes Mark Smith, but it is his nationalist perspective that seems blind. Irish home rule bills were repeatedly vetoed by what Lord Roseberry called ldquothe majority vote of English MPs. This denial of peaceful change, led, eventually, to the collapse of the parliamentary nationalist home rule parties in Ireland to be replaced by Irish Republican Sinn Fein seeking independence. There was violence, many people died in fighting between British forces against Irish, and Irish against Irish. You could argue the Irish civil war only ended with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in .Mr Smith argues Joanna Cherry is wrong to argue against another route for Scottish independence other than a -style referendum. Independence without a referendum worked for Czechoslovakia it looks highly unlikely that any referendum bill for Scotland could get through the Westminster Parliament, never mind any subsequent independence bill, and a Velvet Divorce would avoid much the unpleasantness that is already evident in the metropolitan commentariat.If unionists had expended as much energy finding a solution to Irelands desire for home rule, independence might never have happened. You could argue exactly the same in Scotland since Keir Hardie argued for dominion status for Scotland, but England seems to want us gone, as much as we want to go.GR Weir, Ochiltree.WHY NOT ACCEPT  RESULT I HAD to smile just a little at the irony of Kevin Orrs letterregarding Jill Stephensons letter of January  on Mays elections. He said: \"Ms Stevenson is living in a country that still has a democratic process and she will therefore have to accept the result of that election\". As Mr Orr is clearly of the SNP independence position, did he and his fellow travellers accept the result of the  election  Of course they didnt, despite the overwhelming result ndash  per cent to % ndash against independence.I know that Ms Sturgeon has been presenting herself very well on TV day after day as a more concise leader of her country during this Covid pandemic . However, as a country with the embarrassing record of being sixth-worst for deaths in the world, an education system on the point of collapse, a health service which cannot cope, local government desperate for some of the millions of pounds which the Scottish Government has kept from it, failed policies such as the Named Person and football bigotry policies, why would anyone want to praise Ms Sturgeons Government  And thats before we even consider the road that independence would take us down. Have we not learned from that other nationalist action ndash Brexit, and the damage that it has done to all the UK Councillor Eileen McCartin , Paisley.THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICITMAY I improve on Mrs Freddie Dales statisticsby adding a couple more  Seventy-five per cent of Scottish voters did not vote Tory and yet we have a Tory Government in the UK, and % of Scottish voters voted Remain and yet Scotland is out of the EU.This is known as the democratic deficit and to continue to support it, as Mrs Dale seems to, is fundamentally anti-democratic. I hope that she will eventually come round to a better understanding of democracy.John Jamieson, Ayr.Read more: Independence: Joanna Cherry: A nationalist view of history that raises a worrying vision of the future"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12215043.jpg?type=article-full","title":"remote-learning-scottish-parents-feeling-overwhelmed","story":"Connect warned that, while some know what online teaching will look like for their children, others are still waiting to hear.Executive Director Eileen Prior said survey evidence had highlighted how a signicant number of parents did not feel they had what they needed to support schoolwork at home or did not feel confident.Schools are closed to all but vulnerable and key worker children until at least February , with a review of arrangements due to take place on January .The plan was drawn up in response to a new, more transmissible strain of Covid-.Yesterday was the first day of remote learning for thousands of pupils across Scotland - but teaching activity got off to a rocky start as many youngsters and parents were affected byproblems when trying to useMicrosoft Teams.Update on issue with Microsoft Teams.

Having a third COVID- vaccine approved for supply following a robust and thorough assessment of all the available data is an important goal to have achieved and I am proud that the agency has helped to make this a reality.#The progress we are now making for vaccines on the regulatory front, whilst not cutting any corners, is helping in our global fight against this disease and ultimately helping to save lives.

We have now, as of the early hours of this morning, vaccinated .% of the over--year-olds in England.ldquoWe will reach all over--year-olds and ensure that they have the offer of a vaccine over the coming weeks, and wersquoll reach all of the top four priority groups by February .ldquoWersquore on track and Irsquom confident that wersquoll deliver that. vw,vw,px, px\"Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for NHS staff to be vaccinated within the next fortnight Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for NHS staff to be vaccinated within the next two weeks.The Leicester South Labour MP told the Commons: ldquoThose still going to work are, of course, NHS staff ndash the British Medical Association say , of them are off sick with Covid.ldquoCango further and faster and ensure that NHS staff, frontline staff, receive the vaccination in the next two weeks, and can he provide daily updates on the number of NHS staff who have been vaccinated Mr Hancock replied: ldquoHe is absolutely right to raise the challenges that the NHS is facing today and it is very important that, whilst the rollout of the vaccine is proceeding well, and we are on track to hit the targets that we have set, we must also stress to everybody the importance of following the rules which are in place in order to control this virus and reduce the pressures on the NHS, which are very considerable at this moment.Conservative MP Andrew Percycalled for shop workers to be prioritised for the vaccine in the next phase of its rollout.He said: ldquoCan I ask the Secretary of State to bear shop workers in mind who have had to work throughout this pandemic, including at the beginning, without any protection and who deal with hundreds of people every day  Can we make sure they are prioritised as we move from phase one into phase two Mr Hancock replied: ldquoWersquoll be looking very carefully at those professions that will need to be prioritised in phase two of the prioritisation programme. Wersquoll look at, of course, teachers and police and others, but also we will look at shop workers and we will make those decisions based on the data.Conservative MP Andrea Jenkynsraised concerns about the vaccine rollout in her constituency.She said: ldquoThere are also concerns how some local GP surgeries are only vaccinating people over  with the surnames A to H.Mr Hancock replied: ldquoAmongst the over-s we havenrsquot put in place a more specic prioritisation because we need to make sure that the programme can get to all over-s as fast as possible and as efficiently and as possible.copy -.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie said the group — which was set up in March last year in response to the first lockdown — was ready to go and in a stronger position this time around.“We’re back to where we were in the first lockdown but we are better prepared having had that experience and we are ready to help with whatever is required in supporting the community — whether that#s picking up prescriptions, delivering food, fuel, any practical support or just advice.Commenting on the group#s work following the initial lockdown, he added: #We put contingencies in place because we were aware that a second phase was likely, so we have a huge store of personal Protective Equipment for the health care sector or anyone  who requires it.“This time it has been a lot easier than the first time, we were reacting to the situation then and learning as we went along, but now we are well prepared.“We are here, we have the phone line, it#s open five days a week but we can scale it up to seven days a weekneeded.”He added: “We have a great bunch of people on board and we connect with all the other operations throughout the island.”A number of food share and emergency food provision initiatives are in operation throughout the island and are advertised locally —you need further advice you can call the helpline.Prior to Christmas Skye Community Response volunteers provided  festive hampers and  presents to members of the community mainly around the Portree and Braes area but also island-wide for Women’s Aid.“Nobody should hesitate in getting touch, the food shares are there to be used, and we are here to help.“We have a robust set-up, and we can also direct people to the relevant support in their area.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/LOCKDOWN-LITTERPICK-3.jpg","title":"litter pickers aiming to make a clean sweep across","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye Lockdown Litterpick was set up to encourage people to clean up their local area during the tier  lockdown from Christmas into the New Year, and to date more than  people have become members of the Facebook group.With the conditions of lockdown now tightened until at least the end of January, Dunvegan resident Jennie Chapman, who set up the group, believes that the virtual community of litter pickers is empowering people on Skye to do their bit inidually for a collective cause.: “The Facebook group provides a virtual community where anyone living on Skye can get involved in picking up litter in their local area during this — now extended — lockdown period.“We will then collate all the information about quantities collected and map the areas covered so that we can see an ever growing picture of community involvement in making the island cleaner.“You will see, on the page announcements, a map that is updated every couple of days at least.” Commenting on the response to the group, she said: “At the time of writing there are  members of the group.“Many of these are people who I am sure have been concerned about this issue for some time and may well have already been regularly picking up litter on walks.“However, it can feel like a bit of an uphill battle when you do it on your own so this virtual community is so encouraging when you begin to see how many others care and are also wanting to do their part.”Highlighting the scope of the problem, she added: “We are certainly finding that across the island some of the worst spots for littering include along road verges, especially on the larger roads, around parking areas and lay bys and in popular walking spots.“The range of things that we are collecting includes absolutely huge numbers of drinks bottles, cans, coffee cups and snack wrappers — especially those thrown from car windows along verges — and random items such as huge builders bags, car exhaust pipes and even dirty nappies and used condoms.”Addressing the tightened restrictions now in place, Jennie said: “Everyone taking part is doing so either on their own or in accordance with all now further tightened legal requirements for meeting outside — so from now that will be only with one other person at most and remaining at full social distance.“We have found that two people working to collect from either side of a road verge works well.“All collections are then reported into the group on Facebook for mapping.“At the time of writing we have so far logged  large bin bags full of rubbish being removed from  dferent locations around the island as well as at least  large objects – and we have at least all of January to go!“You will see from the map that the project has now spread to all four corners of the island.”While Jennie acknowledges that the group itself is not a stand-alone solution to the issue, she does hope that it might have a positive effect and persuade people to think twice about littering.She said: “Although this is a short-term project the longer-term issue is unlikely to go away anytime soon so we hope that at least the project raises awareness of the issue.“And maybe it will encourage some people to take their rubbish home rather than littering the countryside and encourages everyone who takes part in trying to keep their local area clean.“There are lots of us out there and we are all part of a bigger picture.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3574441.jpg--.jpg?1609941600000\n","title":"cllr mccaughey gifts kells and connor primary school newly refurbished

I think we now know that the new iant in terms of coronavirus is here in Northern Ireland.The South African iant unfortunately appears to be in the Republic of Ireland.

AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Chief Medical Officer has welcomed the backing of the UK and Ireland#s medical colleges after they said delaying the second dose of Covid vaccinations for medical staff is the right thing to do.Earlier this month Tom Black GP said many doctors were horried over plans to stall by  weeks the second dose of the Pfizer jab to front line staff.After criticism of the UK-wide policy, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges , the coordinating body for the UK and Ireland#s  Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties, issued a statement backing delayed second doses yesterday.Welcoming the intervention, Dr Michael McBride said: The UK-wide decision to reschedule second doses of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine is in line with the authorisation and approval of the MHRAand expert advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .He said it would protect the greatest number of at risk people in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations, and in protecting the health service.Read MoreFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases

rollout of the vaccination programme after questions were raised over thousands of empty appointment slots.It was reported that on Sunday almost  slots went unused in the Belfast Trust, while appointments remained available in five out of six vaccination centres this week.The Department of Health described the concerns over empty slots as a misunderstanding and that any vacant appointments were rapidly filled.The latest figures show that , vaccine doses have been distributed here.This includes , people who have had a first dose .Some , people have now received a second dose, while a further , have also been vaccinated by GPs.Seven regional vaccination centres are providing the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine to health and social care staff and to local care homes via mobile teams.Domiciliary care workers in the independent sector can now also attend the vaccination centres to receive the jab.And a phased programme will see dental, pharmacy and optometry teams given access to the booking system shortly.The department said vaccination appointment slots were only released at short notice to manage the inclusion of dferent staff and vaccine supply, and can be filled quickly.The department added that flexibility is essential for slots to avoid wasting any of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, which comes in large batches.Alongside this, GPs will be administering the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine to their patients.Some GPs have already received their first supplies, with those who are over the age of  first in line.Siobhan McDermott , from Londonderry, questioned

Affected areas include  in or near London, while others include Leeds in West Yorkshire, Chelmsford in Essex, Widnes in Cheshire and Margate in Kent.With some affected residents complaining of not having had mail delivered for more than a month, fears have also arisen that elderly residents will not receive notications of when a coronavirus vaccine is available to them. The issue has prompted calls, including from MPs and the Communication Workers Union , for postal workers to be added to the priority list of people receiving coronavirus vaccinations. Read MoreFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases riseIn a statement published with the list on its website, Royal Mail said it was “working hard to deliver the most comprehensive and high quality service we can to all our customers” despite the pandemic and the associated rise in pressure on delivery resources due to increased online shopping. “The combination of greatly increased uptake of online shopping, and the ongoing Covid- restrictions, mean that all delivery companies are experiencing exceptionally high volumes,” the statement said. “Every single parcel and letter is important to us. Despite our best efforts and signicant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards. “This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices to keep our people and customers safe. “In such cases, we always work hard to get back to providing our usual level of service as quickly as we can.”On its website, Royal Mail advises people in the regions who have been left a “Something for you” card from the service to check its website to learn revised opening hours for when they can collect the item. “If we#ve not left a #Something for you card#, and you do not have alternative arrangements in place, we#re sorry that your mail will not be available for collection,” the advice says. The Daily Mail has reported the CWU has called for the Government to prioritise postal workers on the list of people in line to receive Covid vaccinations, and that BT has also called for its engineers to be added to help with its call-out capabilities.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases riseFirst Minister Arlene Foster has defended the Executive#s decision to relax restrictions over Christmas after hospitals struggled under intense pressure over the weekend.Most ReadRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitMan dies after car and lorry crash near BallyclareMystery as thousands of vaccine slots for Northern Ireland healthcare staff unfilled while over-s waiting for lesaving Covid- jabCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases as healthcare system under extreme pressureMan charged with assault after tussle with police in supermarket over face maskLatest Coronavirus#No running commentary# on publicly-funded retail voucher schemeCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive meets over severe hospital pressuresSuzanne BreenOpinionStormont knew we would pay price for a Merry ChristmasIreland and UK medical colleges back move to stall follow-up Covid- jabLatest from Belfast Hancock: Covid jab enthusiasm on the up as more people see others vaccinatedNicole Kidman #would love to move to Belfast# after experience filming in Northern IrelandSir David Attenborough receives Covid- jabRiz Ahmed reveals he got married recentlyBank deputy warns ‘no free lunch’ from furlough scheme,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Political cowardice meant that the Executive went ahead and lted restrictions in the full knowledge that a very heavy price would be paid.Official statistics show that those crowds of shoppers, packed restaurants, and large family gatherings came at a very cruel cost.In mid-December, our health service was already under huge pressure and there were warnings that the third wave of coronavirus could be the most dangerous. We were also told of new strains of the disease.Covid didn#t know it was Christmas. It followed no calendar. Yet Stormont behaved as though it did. When quizzed about the wisdom of lting restrictions for Christmas on Monday, Foster stressed that it was a unanimous Executive decision.The DUP will clearly win no awards for putting public health first during this pandemic, but why did Sinn Fein, Alliance, the SDLP and Ulster Unionists support the plan Some argued that the parties really had no other option as the public weren#t in the mood for a cautious Christmas. The Executive had to let the air out of the balloon, says a Stormont source. Eventhey hadn#t, people would have done what they wanted anyway.He has a point, and it#s not just up here that recklessness ruled. The Irish Government loosened restrictions signicantly in December and now has the world#s highest infection rate.Read MoreFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases riseICU nurse warns of coronavirus pressures on traumatised staff as they take sick leave or quit altogetherBallynahinch woman Mona Carlisle receives Covid- vaccine just weeks before th birthdayThe Executive handled the first four months of the pandemic fairly well.

In-vision continuity was a real stand-out element of UTV for decades. I love the part I played in that, he said.He had been furloughed for months before the decision was made. When the news came in that it was all over, I#d already seen the way things were going so I wasn#t surprised by it, and I#ll always say that from the moment ITV took over a few years ago both myself and Gillian Porter were treated like royalty as the continuity announcers.They treated us like part of the family and we were asked over to London to the dos, and they were very, very good to us. I#ve no complaints at all.An ITV spokesperson said: We#d like to apologise for the continuity error last night before View from Stormont.

Newtownards man Tom Cahoon had spent months planning his dream wedding to Megan Kennedy on March , .But then, with just two weeks to go before the big day, Covid- struck.Tomand Megan , who live in London, met on the Match dating website in the summer of  and got engaged in late . The pandemic forced the couple to make the dficult decision to postpone their wedding to October  last year. As the new date drew closer and more coronavirus restrictions came their way, they feared their nuptials would have to be put on hold a second time. Determined to say I do, they decided on a small ceremony at their local church, St Stephen#s in Dulwich, followed by a reception at the Corinthia Hotel in Whitehall with  guests, in line with the guidelines at that point. Two weeks before the big day, new rules meant the guest list had to be cut again to . It was all so incredibly stressful as we were so disappointed when we couldn#t get married in March. With the rules changing so quickly we really didn#t believe the wedding was going to happen until the actual day, Megan told the Belfast . We couldn#t even let ourselves get excited until the very last minute as we knew there was always a risk it would all get cancelled again. In order to accommodate close family only in their , Megan#s original bridal party of , including seven bridesmaids, had to be rearranged. Instead, she turned to the strongest and bravest women she knows - her two grans, Mary Kennedyand Gillian Holloway , who gladly stepped in. I#m very close to my two grandmothers. They were always going to be my VIP guests on the day so that was a big factor in our decision to go ahead in October just to make sure they could be there with us, she added.

They thought it was ridiculous at first and that we should give their places to others, as our numbers were so limited, she said. When I explained how important it was to me to have them there by my side on the most important day of my le, they both agreed and then got so excited. Tom said: I thought it was a great idea, and what Megan should have done from the very beginning, as I felt her bridal party of  seemed a bit excessive!The couple are hoping to have a bigger wedding celebration this September, using as many of their original plans as possible.Two of the original bridesmaids, Megan#s sister and her cousin, were able to be in the church last October, and happily stood aside in favour of Mary and Gillian, while some others turned up outside afterwards as a surprise. They were totally understanding about the fact that we had to make some cutthroat decisions, Megan added. They thought it was a really nice idea to ask my grandmothers instead. All being well they#ll still get to step into the roles and wear their bridesmaid dresses as planned this September. Tom explained that many of his family and friends had also been due to fly over to join the celebrations. In the end it was just my parents Jill and Ernie, who travelled over from Ards along with my brother John from Belfast, while my sister Naomi came from Dublin. My other two sisters, Sarah and Hannah, live in London, but my brother Nathan, who is in Edinburgh, missed the wedding as he developed Covid symptoms and had to self-isolate, he said.

I just could not understand it.Mr Shankey said he called the police on Sunday and was informed a report had been made of a suspected breach of the coronavirus rules at his address, however nothing was found. I was angry, he added, who does this The police were courteous and polite, but for all you hear of what is going on did they need to be at my door on a Saturday night Mr Shankey said he and his girlfriend had both suffered a bout of the flu and he was so ill he could not take himself to a Covid testing centre.

Olympic pentathlon gold medallist, Lady Mary Peters, and former Ireland and Lions rugby international Nigel Carr have confirmed that they are winding up their Ulster Sports Museum charity.Despite many pledges and promises of support, and offers of historic sporting exhibits, they say their efforts floundered due to a lack of real commitment to financial support from government.Both said they felt the museum would have paid for itself, as a tourist attraction and an inspiration to future generations. Over  leading sporting figures had already agreed to become patrons of the museum.Lady Mary#s  Munich Olympic gold medal is currently on loan display at the Ulster Museum but she would dearly love to see it on permanent display in a sports museum here, having won it for Northern Ireland.The major stumbling block for the project is money and sustainability through a guaranteed long term funding stream.Mr McCausland, who served as Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure between  and , has expressed his disappointment that the museum bid has halted due to lack of funding. He said: Northern Ireland has a rich sporting tradition and that is reflected in the success of our current sporting heroes such as Jonathan Rea, Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell.Countries around the world celebrate their sporting heritage and it is regrettable that Northern Ireland is still without a sports museum.The former DUP MLA for North Belfast added: Those who have championed this vision down through the years deserve credit for their endeavour and it is something that the Executive should now be embedding in its future plan.A sports museum would not be just about looking back and celebrating success, it would also support the vision of a shared future by reminding us of some of the things we shared in the past. When Mary Peters achieved her Olympic success, people from every community in Northern Ireland celebrated with her. Such shared experiences help to build a shared future.It would also inspire our up and coming sports men and women and encourage participation in sport - which is one of the best ways of tackling the problem of obesity.With all the benefits that could flow from a Northern Ireland Sports Museum it is a project that should not be allowed to wither away.Gary McAllister, from the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland Supporters Clubs, added: I#m sure, like me, many people will be disappointed to hear this news.Northern Ireland has such a rich history of sporting achievement, something which has shone a positive light on our country during many dficult times.Hopefully this is something that could be revisited in the future, because I believe there is a lot of potential to attract large numbers to a location which could incorporate football and all of our sporting history, Mr McAllister added.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMrs McAleese, who served as Irish President from  until , has been critical of the Catholic Church over the role played by women and its views on LGBT issues.Mark BainTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFormer Irish President Mary McAleese has said a change made to canon law by Pope Francis to allow women to be more involved in Mass is “the polar opposite of earth shattering.While making the change Pope Francis continued to affirm that women cannot be priests.Mrs McAleese, herself a devout catholic, said all the new laws will do is right a wrong and that the position of the church hasn’t changed in any real way.Pope Francis amended the law to formalise and institutionalise what is common practice in many parts of the world: that women can read the Gospel and serve on the altar as Eucharistic ministers.Previously, such roles were officially reserved to men even though exceptions were made.Pope Francis said he was making the change to increase recognition of the “precious contribution” women make in the Church, while emphasising that all baptised Catholics have a role to play in the Church’s mission.But he also noted that doing so further makes a distinction between “ordained” ministries such as the priesthood and diaconate, and ministries open to qualied laity.The change comes as the Pope remains under pressure to allow women to be deacons — ministers who perform many of the same s as priests, such as presiding at weddings, baptisms and funerals.Mrs McAleese, who served as Irish President from  until , has been critical of the Catholic Church in the past, particularly over the role played by women and its views on LGBT issues.“The change to canon law made by Pope Francis is the polar opposite of earth shattering,” she said.“It is minimal but welcome all the same for it is at last an acknowledgement that it was wrong of Pope Paul VI to ban women from the stable lay roles of lector and acolyte which remarkably he did after the Second Vatican Council.”She said the law as it stood had always been “untenable”.“These two roles were opened only to laymen simply and solely because of embedded misogyny at the heart of the Holy See which continues today,” said Mrs McAleese.“The law as it stood until Pope Francis’ change was always untenable, unjust and ludicrous given that in many parishes women have been informally reading the scriptures and acting as altar servers despite the laws.”Mrs McAleese previously hit out at the Catholic Church, calling it an “empire of misogyny”, comments made ahead of a conference in Rome about women’s roles in the Church when she also raised the ban on women becoming priests.“Pope Francis has said that the issue of women’s ordination isn’t up for discussion, that women are permanently excluded from priesthood,” she has previously stated.“I believe that women should be ordained, I believe the theology on which that is based is pure codology. I’m not even going to be bothered arguing it. Sooner or later it’ll fall apart, fall asunder under its own dead weight.”McAleese said she wished to “pose a much more profound question” instead.“If you are going to exclude women in perpetuity from priesthood andall decision-making, discernment and policy-making in the Church is going to continue to be filtered through the male priesthood, tell me how in justice and charity, but most importantly in equality, are you going to include the voices of women in the formation of the Catholic faith ” she said at the time.The former President of Ireland was barred by the Vatican from taking part in an International Women’s Day conference which was due to take place in Rome in March .That event was organised by the Voices of Faith group, which is seeking to “empower and advocate for Catholic women to have a seat at the table of decision making in the Catholic Church”.Belfast-born McAleese, now Chancellor of Trinity College Dublin and a Professor of Children, Law and Religion at Glasgow University, has been a long time supporter of LGBT rights. Her son Justin McAleese, who is gay, was a high-profile campaigner during the  same-sex marriage referendum.She has often spoken publicly about frustrations with the Church over its stringent views on LGBT people.Belfast Most ReadRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitMan dies after car and lorry crash near BallyclareMystery as thousands of vaccine slots for Northern Ireland healthcare staff unfilled while over-s waiting for lesaving Covid- jabCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases as healthcare system under extreme pressureMan charged with assault after tussle with police in supermarket over face maskLatest Republic of IrelandNumber of coronavirus hospital patients surges across countryCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive meets over severe hospital pressuresReport into religious-run mother and baby homes to be publishedThree prisoners test positive for Covid-Latest from Belfast Former Strabane councillor James O#Kane diesMoeen Ali coronavirus quarantine extended after mild symptomsPeak demand on NHS might not be until next month, MPs warnedTwo women arrested by police investigating murder of Steven Peck in BallymoneyCare groups call for daily data on numbers of care home residents vaccinated,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

From mid-December  to early January , like the rest of the country, Derry experienced its coldest winter on record when temperatures stayed below  degrees centigrade for days on end. It was the third coldest winter in succession that brought heavy snowfalls, record low temperatures, travel chaos and school closures. The River Foyle, the fastest-flowing river in Europe for its size, froze over , City of Derry Airport was forced to close, sporting fixtures postponed and many Christmas parties and festive nights out with family and friends were cancelled. googletag.cmd.push  Speaking at the time, John Wylie, from the Met Office, said: Sub-zero tem- peratures, widespread deep snow and all of the correct factors coming together at the right time to give us this weather event which will probably go down in history. A temperature of -. degC was recorded in Ballykelly on December , . On the same day, Castlederg in County Tyrone was put firmly on the map - not only did it set a new record Northern Ireland lowest temperature, but it was also the coldest spot on the entire island as the thermometer fell to -.C. The Arctic weather conditions first struck in  . googletag.cmd.push This was followed by the winter of   which for much of the country was worst since  , bringing widespread and heavy snowfalls. Despite the entire country being covered in a blanket of snow,  was not regarded as a White Christmas as no snow fell on Christmas Day.  The scene in Brooke Park in   in a photo taken by Ashlene Joyce. However, just like today, Derry showed its kind nature as a number of community groups took the initiative in ensuring that vulnerable people were looked after during the wintery weather. Volunteers in a number of areas visited elderly people in their homes distributing food and winter clothing and helping with shopping.     Members of the Leafair Community Association  handed out Winter Health Packs to local residents. The packs – distributed in partnership with the Neighbourhood Health Improvement Project– included a thermal blanket, gloves and socks, five energy efficient light bulbs and a thermometer. Peter McDonald, co-ordinator with the LCA, said the scheme proved to be a vital measure in keeping those most at risk from the elements safe. Community volunteers in the Triaxtook part in ‘Operation Snowball,’ aimed at helping the elderly community get through the cold snap, helping old people get to the shops as well as Mass as well as salting salt and clearing the footpaths in Creggan Street, Oakfield and several of the steep streets off the Lone Moor Road. Volunteers also cleared pavements in the Top of the Hill and Shantallow areas. The severe cold spell in the run up to Christmas was estimated to have cost the British economy up to pound. billion a day, with a total cost of pound billion. Retailers were particularly badly hit by lost sales with footfall down nearly % compared to the same period the previous year. Comments by the chief executive of a major hospitality body in the North echoed those of today. Colin Neill, of Pubs of Ulster, which at the time represented % pf pubs in the North, described the situation for the local industry as critical after trade was badly hit by the harsh weather. Hundreds of s had to be cancelled after snow caused massive disruption. Mr Neill said: “This is probably the worst trading period over Christmas on record for our industry. We normally do % of our years turnover in December and we have people cancelling left, right and centre.” After the freeze came the thaw and within days tens of thousands of people were struggling to cope without water because of burst pipes. About  towns and villages across Northern Ireland were affected and many people had to queue every day to get water for drinking and washing. About , homes and businesses were cut off from the mains water supply during the Christmas period and NI Water was severely criticised for its response to those in need.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of theflujab, through participating community pharmacies.” Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering thefluprogramme to date, Minister Swann said:“I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community. googletag.cmd.push I also want to acknowledge the increased role pharmacy teams will play in vaccinating this additional group which will allow GP practices to concentrate on rolling out the Covid- vaccination programme.” The current groups eligible for a freefluvaccination from their GP are now everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , primary school pupils and school children in year  who missed the school vaccination, household contacts of those who received shielding letters and frontline health and social care workers.

Although only detailed family history research will confirm the actual Irish origins of your ancestors, surname histories can provide clues and insight into family origins. The  Foyle Community Directory lists , unique surnames in Derry city. Each of these surnames bears a distinctive history and taken as a whole they are a record of population movements into the Derry area over the past  years. Derry’s dynamic history can be seen in the richness and iety of her surnames. googletag.cmd.push The three commonest names have Donegal origins with Doherty heading the way with  entries, followed by McLaughlin on  and Gallagher with  entries. By way of contrast,  surnames occur only once.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan and sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either ‘Mac’or ‘O’to the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a ‘sept’. A sept can be identied as ‘a group of persons who, or whose immediate and known ancestors, bore a common surname and inhabited the same locality’. As a consequence, Gaelic-Irish surnames are still very dominant and numerous in the very districts where their names originated. By tradition, many of the prominent surnames of Gaelic origin in Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone today trace their descent from either Eoghan or Conal Gulban, two of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, King of Tara who was slain in  AD.     Those tracing descent from Eoghan include: Brolly, Carlin, Devlin, Donnelly, Duddy, Duffy, Farren, Gormley, Hegarty, McCloskey, McLaughlin, Mellon, Mullen, O’Hagan, O’Kane, O’Neill, Quinn and Toner. From Conall Gulban: Doherty, Friel, Gallagher, McCafferty, McDaid, McDevitt and O’Donnell. By tradition, Eoghan and Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland about  AD, and in the process captured the great hill-top fortication of Grianaacuten of Aileach in Inishowen, County Donegal which overlooks the city of Derry and the surrounding countryside. Although Gaelic society was one of the first to adopt a system of hereditary surnames it was also one of the last to perpetuate fixed surnames. People in these societies, in the early th century, were often designated by their genealogies stretching back five or more generations. For example, Shane O’Neill of Shane’s Castle, County Antrim, styled himself on the family vault, which he built in , as ‘Shane McBrien McPhelim McShane McBrien McPhelim O’Neill Esq’. Here is family history in one name stretching back over  years. The last-named Phelim was Felim ‘The Lame’ who was Prince of Clanaboy from  to . The Genealogical Office manuscript collections in Office of the Chief Herald at National Library of Ireland, Dublin are the most important source for the genealogies of Gaelic families and of those families entitled to bear arms either by hereditary right or by grant. On th July , Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen, County Donegal. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, known today as ‘St Columb’s Stone’, inside the walled garden in the grounds of the former Belmont House School, Racecourse Road, Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: the claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood. By tradition, the crowning stone, blessed by Saint Columba, was carried to Belmont from Grianan of Aileach. By tradition, Grianan is identied as being the great “royal fort” of Aileach, the citadel of the northern Ui Neill from the th to the th century. With the Genealogical Office manuscript collections a family chart can be constructed which, on the male line, records the ancestors of Ramon O’Dogherty, “Chief of the Name”, back through  generations to Niall of the Nine Hostages, th century High King of Ireland Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sean, brother of Sir Cahir O’Doherty , who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The founder of the Spanish branch of the O’Doghertys was John who, on the death of his father Eoghan in , came out with his brothers Henry and Clinton Dillon to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the most exclusive branch of the Spanish armed forces. Entry required them to show their genealogy, proving noble origin. In  the King of Arms in Dublin Castle confirmed the three brothers as being “descended in a direct line from Shane or Sir John O’Dogherty, Chief of Innish-Owen”. In the th century substantial numbers of English and Scottish families settled in the northern part of Ireland during the so-called Plantation of Ulster. These settlers came to Ulster, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and, finally, in the fteen years after  and the Glorious Revolution. Famine in Scotlandfrom -, together with landlords in Ulster actively seeking new tenants, resulted in a massive influx of Scottish settlers to Ulster in the s. Substantial numbers of Scottish families entered Ulster through Derry and settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of Counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire the Clyde Valley Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries in Galloway and the Border Lands of Berwick, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Hence surnames such as Anderson, Arbuckle, Armstrong, Barr, Beattie, Bell, Buchanan, Burns, Campbell, Carruthers, Colhoun, Craig, Cunningham, Dunlop, Elliott, Ferguson, Finlay, Fleming, Frazer, Gillespie, Graham, Grant, Hamilton, Hanna, Haslett, Henderson, Holmes, Houston, Irvine, Irwin, Johnston, Kennedy, Kilgore, Lindsay, McAllister, McCartney, McClean, McClelland, McClintock, McCorkell, McCormick, McDonald, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Moore, Olphert, Orr, Parkhill, Patterson, Patton, Rankin, Robb, Rosborough, Ross, Scott, Starrett, Stewart, Thompson, Wallace, Wilson and Young have been established in northwest Ireland for well over three centuries. More recent arrivals from outside the British Isles have also contributed a small but interesting collection of surnames in the Derry area. An Italian community with surnames such as Battisti, Caffola, Cassoni, Centra, Corrieri, Del Pinto, Fiorentini, Forte, Macari, Vaccaro and Yannarelli settled in Derry in the s. A Jewish community with names such as Schenkel, Szilagyi, Spain and Watchman settled in Derry and worshipped in a synagogue in Kennedy Place, and a thriving Indian Community, represented by surnames such as Chada, Singh, Vig and Vij, has been established in the city since the s, most of whom originate from the Punjab in northern India. The family histories associated with surname histories in Derry will, in many instances, be recorded in the database of Derry Genealogy at www.derry.rootsireland.ie.  The database of Derry Genealogy contains the bulk of pre- civil birth and marriage registers for the city and county of Derry, the early baptismal and marriage registers of  churches , gravestone inscriptions from  graveyards, and census substitutes and census s dating from  to .

Within days, the pressure that the system was under was evident through the images shown across media outlets of multiple ambulances queuing outside Emergency Departments. We also highlighted that there was a very real risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed in the event of a further COVID- spike in January. googletag.cmd.push “Although dferent parts of the country are in dferent stages of the third COVID- surge, and inidual hospitals are reflecting this, the situation is very serious with modelling projections indicating that in the third week in January we will be trying to contend with double the number of COVID positive patients compared to the current position today, when several hospitals already have record numbers of patients. “This is not a simple matter of putting up more beds. We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren’t there. googletag.cmd.push “Already several Trusts are having to stand down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery, to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both COVID and non-COVID patients needing ICU care. “These postponed operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. We have established a regional approach to ensure that any available theatre capacity across Northern Ireland is allocated for those patients most in need of surgery, both during surge and as we come out of this surge. “This may mean that patients will need to travel further for their surgery. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options.     “We know that we speak for all health and social care staff in assuring the public that we will do everything that we possibly can to deal with the situation that is unfolding. Our staff, although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it. “It will definitely not be easy and the care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best. Desperately ill patients whether COVID or non-COVID will always be the ones being prioritised. “No-one should be attending an Emergency Department at any time unless they need emergency care. It is likely that those who do attend will wait longer to be seen and for admission to hospitalthat is what they require. “Patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to le threatening emergencies in the community. “Patients also need to leave hospital as soon as they are medically fit to leave. We will work tirelessly to ensure that this happens. That might mean accepting a placement where it is available and it might also mean families having to go the extra mile to provide temporary support for relatives. But we will need every bed that we have for those that are most in need. “Pressure in one part of the health and social care system inevitably impacts on the other parts. For example, we might once again need families to be willing to fill unavoidable gaps in domiciliary care. “Never has the phrase ‘all in it together’ been so pertinent and just so important. The COVID- vaccines provide the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge. The public can play their part too by staying at home, practising social distancing and good hand hygiene and wearing face coverings. “We thank you in advance for your assistance.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Within days, the pressure that the system was under was evident through the images shown across media outlets of multiple ambulances queuing outside Emergency Departments. We also highlighted that there was a very real risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed in the event of a further COVID- spike in January. googletag.cmd.push “Although dferent parts of the country are in dferent stages of the third COVID- surge, and inidual hospitals are reflecting this, the situation is very serious with modelling projections indicating that in the third week in January we will be trying to contend with double the number of COVID positive patients compared to the current position today, when several hospitals already have record numbers of patients. “This is not a simple matter of putting up more beds. We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren’t there. googletag.cmd.push “Already several Trusts are having to stand down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery, to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both COVID and non-COVID patients needing ICU care. “These postponed operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. We have established a regional approach to ensure that any available theatre capacity across Northern Ireland is allocated for those patients most in need of surgery, both during surge and as we come out of this surge. “This may mean that patients will need to travel further for their surgery. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options.     “We know that we speak for all health and social care staff in assuring the public that we will do everything that we possibly can to deal with the situation that is unfolding. Our staff, although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it. “It will definitely not be easy and the care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best. Desperately ill patients whether COVID or non-COVID will always be the ones being prioritised. “No-one should be attending an Emergency Department at any time unless they need emergency care. It is likely that those who do attend will wait longer to be seen and for admission to hospitalthat is what they require. “Patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to le threatening emergencies in the community. “Patients also need to leave hospital as soon as they are medically fit to leave. We will work tirelessly to ensure that this happens. That might mean accepting a placement where it is available and it might also mean families having to go the extra mile to provide temporary support for relatives. But we will need every bed that we have for those that are most in need. “Pressure in one part of the health and social care system inevitably impacts on the other parts. For example, we might once again need families to be willing to fill unavoidable gaps in domiciliary care. “Never has the phrase ‘all in it together’ been so pertinent and just so important. The COVID- vaccines provide the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge. The public can play their part too by staying at home, practising social distancing and good hand hygiene and wearing face coverings. “We thank you in advance for your assistance.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The motion, proposed by Limavady councillor Aaron Callan, will see the council develop an International Causeway Airshow to mark the Queens Platinum Jubilee next year. Cllr Callan said it would also mark  years since the original air show in Portrush. “We are looking to reinvigorate and take this air show in a new direction,” he told the council. “Its been pointed out on numerous occasions the importance of tourism in our area and what it does for our local businesses, and the air show is a signicant part of that. googletag.cmd.push “The air show first took place in  and this would be tying in with the anniversary of when it first started. “The air show is an event signicantly welcomed by the local business community. We have the university report that shows theres a pound. million benefit to the area associated with the air show. “There is going to be an extra bank holiday for the Queens Jubilee in , so that will make the event even more signicant. “A project board involving elected members of no more than , selected using the DHondt system will now be created to develop the event.” googletag.cmd.push Before the meeting, Cllr Callan had secured support from a number of councillors, including Cllr Russell Watton, who spoke in favour at the meeting. “I never thought the air show should have been done away with, it was one of the most successful events we had. The sooner we get it up and going the better, because it was a great event,” he said. “I enjoyed it best out of any event the council held – not just the free grub and glass of wine – but the place was always packed.” Limavady councillor Brenda Chivers spoke against the plans, calling for any available money to be spread equally across the Borough.     “Causeway Coast and Glens is a lot more than Portrush,” she said. “Portrush had the golf, they benefited from the Milk Cup and the North West , what about other parts  “If you go into Limavady, they say everything is in Portrush or Portstewart, and then you have Arlene Foster giving off about people flocking there at the weekend. They benefit a lot more than the rest of the councils areas so I think we should spread the money around.” The motion was proposed by Cllr Aaron Callan of Limavady. Cllr Orla Beattie also raised concerns around the linking of the event with the Queens Platinum Jubilee, and felt the event could be more inclusive. “We have serious reservations with it being linked to the Queens Platinum Jubilee. It doesnt make it more signicant to me or necessarily the people I represent. “To make the air show a key regional event, rather than an event for our Borough, we need it to be inclusive. “By associating it with the Queen, were automatically excluding people who might have otherwise attended.” An amendment from Sinn Feacutein councillor Oliver McMullan asking that the proposal be held until proper discussion could be held how tourism funding is allocated fell by  votes to . After the council had passed the original motion by  votes to , Cllr McMullan askedan equality impact assessment would be carried out on the councils distribution of funds towards tourism. “And agree with the equality impact assessment on the play park named after a terrorist ” replied Cllr Callan. Mayor Fielding informed them that the motion was now done and dusted. A project board involving no more than six elected members, appointed by the DHondt system, will now be set up to develop the event further. In a statement released after the meeting, Bann councillor, Helena Dallat ODriscoll, said the council needs to be mindful of their carbon footprint. “This motion does not sit well for a number of reasons, not least of all because it flies in the face of our own environmental policies,” she said. “Aviation has a huge impact on the atmosphere. The stark reality of climate change is with us and tackling carbon footprint is a challenge we must face. “As elected representatives, we must be seen to take action to address the impact of rising temperatures caused by human generated emissions. “This is no niche political hobby horse - it’s an emergency and it demands immediate action at local level, as well as national and international level. “This proposal far from demonstrates a commitment to reducing the impact on the environment and making a global dference.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The motion, proposed by Limavady councillor Aaron Callan, will see the council develop an International Causeway Airshow to mark the Queens Platinum Jubilee next year. Cllr Callan said it would also mark  years since the original air show in Portrush. “We are looking to reinvigorate and take this air show in a new direction,” he told the council. “Its been pointed out on numerous occasions the importance of tourism in our area and what it does for our local businesses, and the air show is a signicant part of that. googletag.cmd.push “The air show first took place in  and this would be tying in with the anniversary of when it first started. “The air show is an event signicantly welcomed by the local business community. We have the university report that shows theres a pound. million benefit to the area associated with the air show. “There is going to be an extra bank holiday for the Queens Jubilee in , so that will make the event even more signicant. “A project board involving elected members of no more than , selected using the DHondt system will now be created to develop the event.” googletag.cmd.push Before the meeting, Cllr Callan had secured support from a number of councillors, including Cllr Russell Watton, who spoke in favour at the meeting. “I never thought the air show should have been done away with, it was one of the most successful events we had. The sooner we get it up and going the better, because it was a great event,” he said. “I enjoyed it best out of any event the council held – not just the free grub and glass of wine – but the place was always packed.” Limavady councillor Brenda Chivers spoke against the plans, calling for any available money to be spread equally across the Borough.     “Causeway Coast and Glens is a lot more than Portrush,” she said. “Portrush had the golf, they benefited from the Milk Cup and the North West , what about other parts  “If you go into Limavady, they say everything is in Portrush or Portstewart, and then you have Arlene Foster giving off about people flocking there at the weekend. They benefit a lot more than the rest of the councils areas so I think we should spread the money around.” The motion was proposed by Cllr Aaron Callan of Limavady. Cllr Orla Beattie also raised concerns around the linking of the event with the Queens Platinum Jubilee, and felt the event could be more inclusive. “We have serious reservations with it being linked to the Queens Platinum Jubilee. It doesnt make it more signicant to me or necessarily the people I represent. “To make the air show a key regional event, rather than an event for our Borough, we need it to be inclusive. “By associating it with the Queen, were automatically excluding people who might have otherwise attended.” An amendment from Sinn Feacutein councillor Oliver McMullan asking that the proposal be held until proper discussion could be held how tourism funding is allocated fell by  votes to . After the council had passed the original motion by  votes to , Cllr McMullan askedan equality impact assessment would be carried out on the councils distribution of funds towards tourism. “And agree with the equality impact assessment on the play park named after a terrorist ” replied Cllr Callan. Mayor Fielding informed them that the motion was now done and dusted. A project board involving no more than six elected members, appointed by the DHondt system, will now be set up to develop the event further. In a statement released after the meeting, Bann councillor, Helena Dallat ODriscoll, said the council needs to be mindful of their carbon footprint. “This motion does not sit well for a number of reasons, not least of all because it flies in the face of our own environmental policies,” she said. “Aviation has a huge impact on the atmosphere. The stark reality of climate change is with us and tackling carbon footprint is a challenge we must face. “As elected representatives, we must be seen to take action to address the impact of rising temperatures caused by human generated emissions. “This is no niche political hobby horse - it’s an emergency and it demands immediate action at local level, as well as national and international level. “This proposal far from demonstrates a commitment to reducing the impact on the environment and making a global dference.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With City boss Declan Devine hard at work behind the scenes as he attempts to strength the squad for the coming season, he may well have to do without his current captain, who is considering leaving the club despite having one year left on his contract. Galway United are believed to be one of the clubs interested in McCormack, with boss John Caulfield eager to build a squad capable of challenging for promotion from the First Division this year. Caulfield brought McCormack to Cork City back in  and the combative midfielder was made captain at Turners Cross. He played a key part in Cork winning the league and FAI Cup double just a year later, scoring a penalty in the shoot-out victory over Dundalk at the Aviva Stadium, googletag.cmd.push Just a few months after Caulfield left the club in , McCormack also left, ing to the Brandywell for a second spell at the club. McCormack was originally brought to Derry City by Peter Hutton in mid- and spent  months, making  appearances and scoring one goal before moving to Turners Cross. He ed to the Brandywell at the end of , and was made captain by Declan Devine, seen as a direct replacement for Greg Sloggett who had joined Dundalk after just one season in red and white. The lure of European football was a big factor in McCormack ing, but it ultimately proved to be a disappointing season with City knocked out of the Europa League at the first time of asking by Lithuanian side FK Riteriai. googletag.cmd.push Domestically, City also struggled, as they travelled to Cork City on the final day of the season needing a point to ensure their Premier Division status. The point from that - draw saw the Candystripes finish in seventh place. In a season which Covid- affected football across the world, City were also badly hit, with two outbreaks at the Brandywell, bringing a disruptive inconsistency to games in the final two months of the season. Despite the upheaval, McCormack was an ever-present in the City side, featuring in  of  games in all competitions, again scoring one goal. McCormack’s last act as City captain could well have been his missed penalty in the FAI Cup quarterfinal loss at Sligo Rovers, after which he admitted that it had been a dficult year for everyone involved.     “It has been horrible,” he said. “There’s no way of dressing it up. It has been very dficult for players. “It’s been a very dficult season for us, especially there the last few weeks. We were locked up for two weeks then played two games over  hours without having been able to prepare properly. “Then we went into another two weeks lockdown and didn’t have time to prepare properly for Sligo which was a really winnable game. “We didn’t get off to the best start. We got a bit of momentum and then there was the shutdown. We didn’t start well after the break and found ourselves in a dficult situation. “We pulled it out of the bag with another couple of wins and were shut down again, so it was very hard to build momentum or team morale. There were no team bonding sessions as we were all separated away from the training area.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas.

We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds.

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either. Younger brother Jack has played Irish League football as a goalkeeper, but has more recently focused his attentions on Gaelic Games, putting in some super displays for the Down Gaelic football under- side..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2021 Leah.jpg","title":"Leah signs deal  ","story":"SAINTFIELD martial arts fighter Leah McCourt has been confirmed as an ambassador with Everlast Worldwide, the worldrsquos leading manufacturer of boxing, MMA and fitness equipment.Leah has signed an exclusive, multi-year fight sports equipment and sports apparel agreement.In a ground-breaking first for the brand, Leah is the first female athlete to be placed on an apparel deal from the UK.She says she is delighted to join Team Everlast as the newest addition to its elite athlete roster.ldquoIt is a dream come true to sign with the most iconic brand in combat and I am proud to be continuing to make history, she remarked.ldquoWe have some exiting ideas in the pipeline and I cannot wait to bring them to le and to continue changing the game.The -year-old fights under leading MMA organisation Bellator.

At any other time we would be welcoming visitors with open arms.

We have in essence been in a lockdown-type situation for a long time.Even so, Craig said Newcastle League officials are not yet throwing in the towel in trying to devise a way for a season to be played.ldquoAny decision we make with regards to how and when we can get football back up and running again will be taken in conjunction with our clubs.ldquoWe need their input on how they feel about the situation, and there needs to be a want from the clubs to get back to playing as well. All of those things will be up for discussion within the league committee when we know where we stand.Amateur League chairman Terry Pateman says he has not yet given up hope of getting some sort of season put together over the next few months.ldquoWe are still essentially working blind, he said. ldquoWe are trying to devise ways of starting the new season before we know what the government are going to decide next, he said.ldquoIf there were no further stoppages beyond the dates already in place for us, we could proceed with what would obviously be a shortened season.

While the appreciation of these workers may have changed in the eyes of some their pay and conditions have not.The crisis has further illustrated the incredible work undertaken by our nurses and doctors, in addition to the work undertaken by public transport workers, cleaners and those in our emergency services.Long periods of having to work from home for others have also served to highlight that homes are our sanctuary.

For nationalists and republicans, the centenary of partition will not be a cause for celebration.It does, however, give us cause to look to the possibilities and opportunities for the future of the people of this island.This is a defining moment in our history and people will have decisions to make on what is in the best interests of our island.We are in a decade of opportunity where the right to decide our own future rests in the hands of our people. The conversation on Irish unity is well underway across our society.The provision for a referendum on unity is part of the Good Friday Agreement.We now have a choice between a narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain or the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland. should be about an inclusive conversation.

Not it is administering vaccines.Yet the use of the army in Northern Ireland has been a source of near embarrassment since the March lockdown. It has, it seems, become a matter of negotiation, because republicans, who want NI to fail, do not want them about the place.The appropriate reaction to this would be: tough.

But, for all that, there must be no question of the use of the army in sovereign UK territory being a matter of negotiation, or joint role for the Irish army. The government in London has done more than enough to damage the Union with its Irish Sea border.Not only should the army’s input be sought, we should always accept their help in such situations in NI.Meanwhile, London should be ensuring that devolved governments can only at first call on the UK armed services in relevant emergencies, and indeed that they never get the power to block such a role, or make it contingent on the input of other armed forces.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and primary care settings like GP surgeries.Wales health minister Vaughan Gething said: ldquoWe understand there are high expectations and excitement at the arrival of a second vaccine. However it will take time to reach everyone as this is not an instant fix. We wonrsquot receive all the doses at once and we have to be realistic about the scale and pace of delivery when we are vaccinating the entire adult population.ldquoWe will not see the impact of the vaccine for some months and the pressure on the NHS will continue during this winter.

To help the NHS to help you please wait to be invited for your vaccination.Senior responsible officer for Walesrsquo Covid- vaccine programme Dr Gillian Richardson said: ldquoThe vaccine has been approved as safe and effective by the MHRA, based on the same high standards as applied to all medicines and vaccines.ldquoIt is great news that a second vaccine has met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the MHRA.Dr Nicola Williams, director of support and delivery at Health and Care Research Wales, which is nationally co-ordinating research and study-set up in Wales, said: ldquoOur research community is working hard to provide the evidence we need to fight this pandemic and the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is an important step forward. We have two further vaccines being tested in Wales right now, with more trials due to be set up in the coming weeks and months.ldquoThis research, alongside the other Covid- studies taking place will help us to not only protect the most vulnerable but also to provide the best care possible for those who become ill.ldquoIrsquom proud of the role our researchers in Wales have played in this UK-wide effort and I would like to thank the participants too who have volunteered.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
