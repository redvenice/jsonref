His tenderness belies his imposing six-foot frame and the care and compassion for the people he calls “family” is plain for all to see.Walls is clinical lead at Saint Cecilia’s Nursing Home in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. He is sitting in Lily’s room, wearing PPE, after she was nursed back to health after contracting Covid-19. She is one of 11 people who have taken up residency on the isolated “Covid floor” of Saint Cecilia’s.When I arrived I was met at a front door adorned with images of angels, unicorns and rainbows, seemingly drawn by the young relatives of residents. “Do you mind going around the back?” asks Anne Brand, the executive administrator from Saint Cecilia’s Care Group. No visitor has ventured through the front door for some time. As the pandemic lockdown came, all visits were suspended to protect the vulnerable.I’m met at the rear door by Walls (15 years of military service) with his imposing figure fully blocking the doorway. “I need to check your temperature first,” he says. “Thirty-six point eight, come in,” and I’m led into what would seem to be the service quarters of the Victorian building.The home, which specialises in the nursing care of people at high risk of “deterioration”, was originally the Dorchester Hotel. It’s close to Scarborough spa, which was the UK’s first seaside resort, and once an upmarket destination for wealthy London visitors. But it went into decline in the 1970s when package holidays drew the holidaymakers away to guaranteed sunnier climes.Mike Padgham, owner and manager director of Saint Cecilia’s Care Services, agreed to give me access to the home. He has been a prominent advocate for reform of the care sector for a number of years, calling for better pay and career recognition of the work done by staff within the sector. It has taken a number of weeks to gain access to the home as permission was needed from residents, their family and staff. My visit was registered with the Care Quality Commission and I was required to wear full PPE.I was quizzed on my health, my partner’s keyworkers’ role and asked to sign a declaration of health. The white PPE overalls covered me head to toe, I wore a face mask, face shield and protective gloves. It was as hot, uncomfortable, ungainly and impersonal as it gets.It’s just before lunch and the television is on. I’m spotted by cheery resident Angela Morgan, with team leader Corina Grigoruta, and she’s smiling for my camera. She has been a resident for the past six years. I may have been the first person outside of the care environment that she has seen for three months. The scene is heart-warming and it is hard to believe the devastation this pandemic has had on the care sector. The dedicated staff, until recently described and labelled as unskilled, are now seen as keyworkers.“It’s frustrating,” say Walls. “The staff have been amazing here. I have massive respect for the NHS but social care has been left out. The work has gone unrecognised for a long time.”The first two weeks of lockdown were particularly bad, he laments. We had one lady come in with no symptoms but then later died of Covid. Then, in the space of two weeks, 10 people died. “It was heart-breaking,” he says, recalling the time he came in to manage the last hours of a dying resident only for the resident in the next room to die shortly afterwards.“I would rather have been in Iraq,” he says. “It’s a situation you expected there, we had the training. We didn’t expect that in a care home. We couldn’t get a GP to come in. It was horrific. It was really hard for the staff to take.”Allan Booth is lying in his bed, eating his lunchtime dessert. Nearby there is a picture of him as the town crier and on his wall another of him with his contemporaries. He was known locally as Mr Scarborough for his services to the town. “I did it because I loved it,” he says. Thirty one years as town crier but also 19 years as the town’s Santa. Each Christmas, Scarborough’s Santa Claus would arrive by fishing boat into the harbour that Booth can see from the window of his room at St Cecilia’s. He didn’t like the water so much, so each year organised a stunt double to ride in the boat and, through the magic of Christmas, managed to switch positions, on dry land, before the young onlookers noticed. Booth liked to talk. Vera Lynn had died that day and as we departed, the 88-year-old serenaded us with a rendition of We’ll meet again.Sybil Thompson lay in her bed. Her beauty and poise undimmed by her fading years. Nursing assistant Kasia Kapuscinka was helping her with her medication and a drink of coconut milk. A photograph of the 97-year-old’s large, extended family peered down from the wall besides her bed, easy for her to see. Despite her frailty, her energy had no limits her laughter and joie de vivre filled the room.The light from the afternoon sun was shining down on her face. She had celebrated her 70th wedding anniversary with her husband, Robert, at the home. Until recently, he too was a resident in the room next door. A couple in love “till death do us part”.The word “family” crops up time and again. “Many families have been fantastic”, says Walls. “They’ve understood everything. Even donated money just to say thank you.”“They are like family” is a much-used phrase but it’s hard not to feel the pain, pressure and fatigue many of the care staff have undergone. Many residents have been in the home for a number of years. Their needs cared for on a daily basis, and bonds forged. Their history learnt and family relationships understood. Physically and emotionally, the lockdown has taken its toll on the country as a whole, but the work in care homes has long gone undervalued and underrepresented.Donna Henderson, registered manager: “We’ve been through a difficult time and it’s been tough for us all, but I have a great team and we’re getting through by supporting each other. Staff have done an amazing job at keeping morale high! We are all proud of how we’ve managed these unpredictable events.”Sarah Earp, head housekeeper: “I came to work here straight from school, aged 15. I’ve been here 22 years and now I’m the head of housekeeping. I make sure that we are fully stocked with PPE, make sure all the cleaning is done on schedule and up to date. We have a 24-hour cleaning schedule now, in line with Public Health England guidance. You do get bugs in the home, we have always managed to keep it to a minimum. To keep things at bay, sometimes we have to isolate residents. Regarding PPE, some people don’t understand the problem. We haven’t run out. It’s the price some people are expecting us to pay. I think it’s extortionate. We pay £1.30 a box for vinyl gloves, which is great. But recently, some suppliers have been trying to charge £16 a box. That’s where we need the help from government. We need them to stop putting the prices up.”Corina Grigoruta, team leader: “I came to the UK for a better future. This company gave me a chance that I didn’t have in Greece. They gave me the chance to develop my skills. I like to work with people. It is so nice to help people and make people happy every day. I think all of us were stressed at the beginning of lockdown. We need to take care of our mental health, too. We are a very good team. We helped the residents to be without stress and explained Covid-19. We protected them and ourselves, which is very important. I have two children and they are very proud of me. In the beginning, we understood that we should stay apart. I was worried for my family, too. I was isolated in my bedroom. It was alright. We could manage.”Jojo Wilson, healthcare assistant: “I started work on 4 March then, seven days later, the lockdown came. It is my first role in care and I love it. I’m kinda glad that I started when I did because you just had to get on with it. Everyone pulled together as a team the staff, management were amazing. It was scary because we didn’t know what was coming, whether we would lose people. Sadly, we did lose some people. But we needed to just get on with it, these people needed our help. I love the job. I want to be able to go on and get my NVQs and work my way up. There have been loads of highlights. There is a resident called Susan and on my birthday she gave me a card and wrote in it: ‘Thank you for everything that you do for me.’ I was like, ‘oh my God’. That’s so rewarding.”Anne Brand, executive administrator: “For me, the past few months have been a whirlwind, adapting to home working, Covid-19 taking over work and homelife, supporting frontline carers in our homes and the pressures of being a good parent and there for my family and to home school. All of this has been a challenge and there have been good days and bad days. I am immensely proud to work in social care. My daughter leaving me notes saying, ‘good job Mummy’ saying she is proud of me got me through when things were tough.”Graham Pryce, housekeeper: “I started in May 1989, I’ve been here 31 years. I work in house keeping and do the all the cleaning, polishing, dusting and washing up that needs to be done in the home. I’ve been tested twice and I’m all ok.”“We have had too many reviews with nothing done,” says Walls. “We don’t want to be another statistical promise.”“We are a forgotten bunch of guys that do an incredible job. It’s not an unskilled job. It’s a very skilled job. The staff here have been heroes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b908284adf429e17121688aec9ae6240d3f54c8c/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efe196cca75ea9a5e24be558240b2c3f","title":"george floyd tributes concert for plants 20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests continue and Liverpool win the Premier League title – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f073d482f3485a37a00db6695629ad3a69f5b9/0_480_7108_4264/master/7108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57038a7c8aec4eb89997d44c3f4e00d5","title":"ashley dotty charles few moments compare to meeting oprah","story":"The rapper and radio presenter on the problem with online activism, the power of protest, and the moment Oprah squeezed her handAshley “Dotty” Charles is the host of BBC’s 1Xtra breakfast show. Charles, 32, grew up in south London with two brothers and a sister and began rapping at 13. After a brief spell in Los Angeles with her family as a teenager, Charles moved back to the UK, graduated from Kingston University and, in 2012, signed to Virgin Records – the first British female MC to sign a major label album deal in more than a decade. She now lives in Surrey with her wife and their three-year-old son, with another baby on the way. Her forthcoming debut book, Outraged: Why Everyone Is Shouting and No One Is Talking, is published by Bloomsbury.Your book is a swipe at the empty rhetoric of activism that only exists with a hashtag online. It’s timely now, but what prompted it?I was on holiday in Thailand when I checked my phone – I shouldn’t have – and landed on an online feeding frenzy, one of those occasional social media moments where everyone is shouting about the same thing. Wall-to-wall fury. The currency of outrage, to me, was so twisted that I ended up writing about it in the . The feedback was amazing and I felt I’d found my tribe. Book publishers got in touch after that.People have been out on the streets for Black Lives Matter even during a global pandemic. How does it feel to witness?This is such a powerful time. In the book, I talk about “clicktivism” – activism that lives and dies online and is of no consequence because it’s not mobilised. And I think, for the first time, a lot of the people protesting are 18- and 19-year-olds who haven’t engaged at this level before.Do you believe it is a pivotal moment, one that will have lasting effects?Absolutely. You’re seeing tangible change. Police departments in the US are being defunded. The revolution won’t happen online but the power of the internet can change everything. It’s the platform that triggers the dialogue and for young people who are going to shape the future, the ideas for them are sparked there. I don’t want to be hyperbolic about it but it does feel as though this is the moment. There is something in the air.Outrage feels positive in that context but, as you have observed, it’s become wildly overused too. Where Jamie Oliver’s “jerk rice” can provoke as much noise as genuine social injustice…I think we have to be really vigilant in our outrage. We need to realise what is and isn’t worth engaging in. I’m somebody who has also engaged in absolute shit online. We do it because there’s so much in the world that is just insurmountable. And it’s much easier to start slagging off Piers Morgan than it is, as an inidual, to start trying to deconstruct institutional racism. If we can exert that energy collectively on the bigger issues, and bring down the systems rather than the iniduals, we will, as we are seeing now with the Black Lives Matter movement, see real change.You spend a chapter speaking to and deconstructing Katie Hopkins. What did you learn, if anything?That we can suffocate purveyors of hate like Katie Hopkins by disengaging with them.How do we revalue outrage when it is the social currency of our press, politicians, and national debate?It’s so difficult. This book isn’t a manual. It’s not me saying these are the answers and this is what we need to do. For me personally, how I revalue my outrage is that I channel my responses. I’m so mindful of what does, and doesn’t warrant my engagement. I don’t think we realise how much of a toll it takes to be perpetually outraged. So often, we’ll see something awful, like a Daily Mail headline, whether it’s a misstep or a massive atrocity, and then we’ll retweet it and comment how awful this thing is, but you’ve now just shared it to your network. You’ve made it louder than it was a second ago.What has your lockdown been like?The first stage was quite nice, it felt like we were collectively taking a pause. We were having three elaborate meals a day, doing puzzles, we created an at-home nursery experience for our son… Now we’re just watching Netflix and trying to keep our kid out of the washing machine.You’ve smashed 1Xtra’s listening figures with the breakfast show. What’s the secret to your success? I don’t think there is a secret! Broadcasting is all about speaking to people and I think I’m fortunate to be able to have so many great conversations with listeners. There’s nothing I love more than fading up a caller and sharing the airwaves with someone who I might never have met otherwise. When someone from Bristol comes on air to tell you about an awful date they went on or a mother gets in touch to say their kids have ripped the curtains down… I love being invited into people’s lives, it’s a massive honour.Your career has gone to the next level in the phast couple of years. What have the “pinch me” moments been?There have been so many but few compare to meeting Oprah. I interviewed her for my show and was then invited to introduce her at a film premiere the next day. So there we were behind the screen at a central London cinema and I was getting ready to warm the audience up for her Q\u0026ampA when she grabbed my hand.

In Brussels, there is concern that amid the post-pandemic fallout, the generational task of addressing the climate emergency and implementing tough green targets will be put to one side. Europe’s place in a newly multi-polar world, dominated by the increasingly tense rivalry between the United States and China, must be worked out anew. Post-epidemic, there is a new emphasis on economic self-sufficiency, particularly in medical manufacturing and key industries. The European Union’s future trading relationship with Britain needs to be agreed in a matter of months.In a context this formidable, it is the EU’s good fortune that Germany, the largest and most powerful member state, will take over its rotating presidency this week. For obvious reasons of history, Germany has traditionally been reluctant to punch its weight on the European stage. But extraordinary times demand clear leadership. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, appears determined to provide it. Outlining her plans for the presidency recently, Ms Merkel told German MPs that: “Europe needs us, just as we need Europe.” Brexit trade talks are likely to be treated as one dimension of a bigger problem: shoring up the single market during a period of economic turmoil.In an interview with the  and other European newspapers this weekend, Ms Merkel made it clear that her most urgent priority will be to reach swift agreement on a €750bn post-coronavirus recovery fund, to be financed by EU-issued debt and distributed to countries in the form of grants rather than loans.Signing off on this innovation, first proposed by Ms Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in May, would be a landmark moment. The prospect of pooling debt with impecunious southern neighbours has traditionally been anathema to the EU’s more prosperous member states, with the resistance usually led by Germany. A so-called Frugal Four – Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands – will mount a fierce rearguard action to water the plan down. But the searing experience of the last three months appears to have changed perceptions in Berlin of what is possible and desirable.Domestically, a sacrosanct commitment to balanced budgets has been put to one side to allow a gigantic stimulus package and state bailouts. At a European level, Ms Merkel believes a step-change in solidarity is required. She has rightly warned that a failure to take collective action to stabilise Europe’s reeling economies will play into the hands of anti-democratic and authoritarian forces.The tone and approach are strikingly different from a decade ago, when Ms Merkel and her then finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, helped enforce EU-wide austerity measures in the wake of the financial crash. But during her 15-year stint as chancellor, Ms Merkel has demonstrated a peerless ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Before Covid-19 struck, she was viewed as a lame-duck leader, having announced her intention to stand down in 2021. Instead, Germany’s assured handling of the epidemic has enhanced her authority and provided the political capital to take necessary risks in what has become a crisis presidency. Germany has sometimes been criticised for “leading from behind”. For the next six months, Ms Merkel will be leading from the front. For the EU, at a time when the stakes have never been higher, that is good news."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd9b0a20f1bd39278b8d4c6c28ccb948f7b69091/0_146_4407_2645/master/4407.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e0d03c03534caf52bd12e914b9c7bea1","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

In the UK, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, this week told MPs that the government will experiment with hydrogen fuel cells for an entire town’s bus network. Earlier this month, the Department for Transport gave £400,000 to the Hydroflex project, run by the University of Birmingham and rail-leasing company Porterbrook, to bring the first hydrogen train to UK main lines in the next few weeks.Fuel cells function by running hydrogen over a catalyst, often platinum, stripping away electrons that run through an electrical circuit. The positively charged hydrogen ions combine with oxygen in the air to form water as its only emission, while the electricity generated can run the same motors as used in any electric vehicle, giving a fuel source with zero harmful exhaust emissions.Crucially, the hydrogen must be produced from clean sources to be carbon neutral, or “green”. So-called blue hydrogen, created using methane gas rather than electrolysis of water, has attracted significant interest from fossil fuel producers, but it does not come with the same environmental benefits.Carmakers have recognised the potential of the technology for decades. Detroit’s General Motors first tested its hydrogen-powered Electrovan in 1966, but in the UK only 169 hydrogen cars have ever been registered. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, regularly describes “fool cells” as “staggeringly dumb” for passenger cars, given the inefficiencies of using electricity to produce hydrogen rather than directly to power vehicles.Yet many large automotive manufacturers are sticking with it. Toyota, the world’s second-largest carmaker, planned – before the pandemic – to produce 30,000 of its Mirai hydrogen cars in 2020, but larger vehicles are the main aim, said Johan van Zyl, chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe, earlier this year.“We need scale for hydrogen to be successful,” he said. “To find scale I think heavy commercial vehicles and buses will be the first phase of hydrogen application in Europe.”Hydrogen has already been used successfully in large vehicles. Transport for London’s RV1 bus ran for eight years shadowing the Thames, clocking up more than 1m miles. Buses run on regular routes and return to depots, removing the biggest obstacle to mass adoption of hydrogen: the lack of a network of filling stations across the UK.The logic of using hydrogen for buses prompted Jo Bamford, the heir to the JCB digger empire, to buy RV1 manufacturer Wrightbus out of administration in October. The Northern Irish busmaker is working with Bamford’s hydrogen production company, Ryse, on a plan to popularise hydrogen buses, with an early order for 20 from TfL and others in the pipeline.Bamford, whose father is Lord Bamford, the billionaire Tory donor, lobbied for the government to support a hydrogen bus experiment.Bamford estimated that Wrightbus would be able to produce buses at the same cost as diesel at a rate of about 600 buses a year. He expected the firm to be profitable in 2020 before the pandemic struck, and acknowledged that he had spent “millions” of pounds keeping the company afloat after it was forced to stop production.Part of Bamford’s pitch was that the UK could be a world leader in hydrogen, if it invests in infrastructure soon. “We missed the boat on batteries in Britain,” he said. “This is a great British solution.”For rail and vehicle usage – and potentially aircraft – fuel cells have the major benefit of allowing refuelling within minutes, comparedwith the hours of charging required by some battery-powered cars.The flurry of activity has piqued investor interest. Sheffield-based ITM Power has what it claims is the world’s largest factory making electrolysers, the machines that break down water into its hydrogen and oxygen constituents. Shares in the Aim-listed company, backed by chemicals giant Linde, have more than tripled in price since the start of the year.Graham Cooley, ITM’s chief executive, says the revolutionary reduction in renewable energy costs has made hydrogen into a genuine solution across the economy. Solar- and wind-powered electrolysis offers the prospect of carbon-neutral hydrogen production, which could also provide an effective way of storing unpredictable renewable energy.“The market for green hydrogen is expanding exponentially,” said Cooley. “The whole world is moving to net zero.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f71f4e06958cf7363ea03fbadd3fd94bb59fa5de/0_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48f415e42a0f7fd2c1ed679f46fed250","title":"on the record review metoo music doc is essential viewing","story":"Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering’s intersectional approach to exploring sexual abuse in the music industry is candid and empatheticThis essential documentary from Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering offers a much needed recalibration of #MeToo, taking into account race and the additional weight shouldered by black women who decide to come forward with their experiences of rape and sexual abuse.

Never mind the priority of delivering a Champions League finish, which looks on after the impressive Premier League victory over Manchester City last Thursday, his team are now into the last four of the FA Cup.Lampard won the lot as a Chelsea player, including four FA Cups, and how he would love to claim his first piece of silverware as a manager in the final of this competition at Wembley in August.Ross Barkley fired the possibility with the only goal of an absorbing game after being sent on as a second-half substitute. Chelsea had been poor in the first-half but they were much improved after the interval to keep the feelgood factor at the club bubbling.Off the field they have invested £89m on Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech for next season and, on it, they can feel things coming together after the restart of action. Barkley’s finish was a beauty, converted low and first-time from an angle on the right of the penalty area, and it meant more frustration for Brendan Rodgers and Leicester.They were slick in the first half but could find no reward and, after fading in the second, they know that it is three games without a win since the restart and, more broadly, only two wins in the past ten. The attention will now return to the push for a Champions League finish, which would be an incredible achievement, but they can feel the thunder of the chasing pack, with not only Chelsea but Wolves and Manchester United having closed on them.Rodgers had mentioned Leicester’s Carabao Cup semi-final loss to Aston Villa before kick-off, how much that defeat in January had hurt and his players began as if affronted by the memory. There was an easy balance in their 4-3-3 system, pace and bite, and Chelsea had to parry a series of early thrusts.One of the features of post-lockdown summer football are the drinks breaks. It is now a game of four quarters and, although it was debatable whether they were needed on a blustery day at the King Power, Leicester reached the first one in the ascendancy.They pressed onto the front foot and were routinely first to the ball, most notably when Youri Tielemans stepped up to intercept a pass from Billy Gilmour that was meant for Mason Mount. Tielemans advanced and shot low for the corner Willy Caballero got down to turn it behind.Ben Chilwell’s free-kick delivery was a weapon for Leicester. He had picked out the commanding Wilfred Ndidi in the 13th minute only for the midfielder to head straight at Caballero. Ndidi had found space but not as much as Jonny Evans would do on 29 minutes. The centre-half got the run on Antonio Rüdiger to meet Chilwell’s ball only to glance off target. He should have done better.Chilwell caught the eye in the first half, his speed either up the flank from left-back or on the defensive transitions a problem for Chelsea and Leicester had a couple of flickers up that channel before the break. First, Harvey Barnes got the run of the ball after Rüdiger jumped in on Tielemans only to lash high and later Jamie Vardy dragged well wide after running onto a Barnes pass.Lampard made six changes to the line-up that had beaten City – Rodgers made four from the draw with Brighton James Maddison was out with a hip problem – and Chelsea struggled to make any inroads in the first half. However, out of seemingly nothing, they created the clearest chance and only Kasper Schmeichel’s reflexes kept out Christian Pulisic.All it took was a penetrative pass from Mount in the 31st minute and a slicing run from Pulisic inside the area. The American darted from left to right to blow open a seam of space and his rising drive was struck firmly. Schmeichel was equal to it.Lampard addressed his right flank at half-time, replacing Reece James and Mount with César Azpilicueta and Barkley while he also swapped Gilmour for Mateo Kovacic on the left of the midfield three. Something needed to be done and Chelsea were more assertive from the restart, occupying higher starting positions and taking the game to Leicester. Now, the aggression belonged to them.Tammy Abraham had the ball in the net only to be correctly pulled back for offside before Barkley made the difference, stealing in behind Ndidi to sweep in Willian’s centre before Evans could get across. It was Barkley’s fourth goal of the season all have come in the domestic cups.Leicester never looked like finding the equaliser to force extra-time, although Caglar Soyuncu headed at Azpilicueta and wide towards the end after a Caballero flap and Ndidi was off target with a first-time sidefoot. Barkley might have added a second only to choose the wrong option after a four-on-two break in the 89th minute and then see Schmeichel save from him when he got the ball back.

Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Lampard apologies for sounding down, then finishes by saying that he can only say the game as he sees it, and that the young players he took off are going to be big players for Chelsea so shouldn’t be discouraged.Frank Lampard says his team’s second-half performance was “So-so”, saying his team have rarely played so badly and often played worse and lost. He could easily have made seven or eight changes at half-time, he gripes, and that his players were too slow to the ball and too slow on the ball. They’d worked so hard v City, attacking with pace and quality, but that went today he’s glad they can win playing badly, though. Southampton now lead Watford 3-1. Elsewhere, Forest are on the march.In the studio, they’re talking about Ross Barkley, and whether Lampard can help his decision-making. At 26, that seems unlikely to me, but he can certainly give him licence and confidence. Ross Barkley reckons it’s important that Chelsea won today and confides that Frank Lampard likes his midfielders to get into the box. At half-time, Lampard told his players that the effort to that point wasn’t good enough for the badge and that he wanted them to be more vocal on the pitch.Back to Chelsea, what we saw today is what happens when a team has momentum: it doesn’t work so the manager gives other players opportunities, and then it does work.Extremely Mike Goldberg voice: coming up next, Newcastle v Man City. Join Rob Smyth for that one.Chelsea, meanwhile, are on a buzz. They were terrible in the first half but Frank Lampard acted decisively to resolve matters, it worked, and the upshot was another little thing that tells the players things are going for them. Leicester are in some trouble. They’re out of the cup, obviously, but they’re now only three points ahead of Wolves in fifth place and travel to Everton on Wednesday, which is to say that season is in trouble: they’re struggling to score, and struggling to make scoring opportunities. Chelsea go through to the semis, Leicester go out!90+4 min Pedro breaks from halfway and has options, but decides to hang onto possession before finding Barkley when it’s too late. 90+3 min James Maddison’s t-shirt is indeed extremely large, straight out of 1991 large. In a private box, puts his head in his hands. 90+2 min Leicester push Chelsea back, Gray knocking back for Chilwell, who slides across for Ndidi ... but, opening his body to create an angle, he curls his shot wide.90+1 min Leicester started pretty well, but ultimately this has been another poor performance from them. They’ve struggled to create, and when Chelsea turned it up, the identity of the better team was clear.90 min There’ll be four added minutes. 89 min Chelsea break four v two but Barkley is lost in the supermarket, passing behind Loftus-Cheek, who does really well to poke a return back to him. This time, Barkley has a look, then drives hard, and Schmeichel manages to block the ball into the ground so that it sails up and over the bar ... just. 89 min Another good cross from Albrighton and this one flicks a defender before not quite falling for Vardy. 87 min Can Leicester create one last chance? I’m surprised Iheanacho is still sat at the side, but in the meantime Albrighton slings over another fine cross that doesn’t quite pick out a Leicester brow. 85 min Was that the chance? Leicester win a free-kick and even though Tielemans’ delivery isn’t great, Chelsea can’t get it away, so Albrighton sashays inside Emerson, sending him out for a bag of bogroll before flighting a lovely cross towards the back post! But Azpilicueta jumps early and gets a little flick on it, so that Soyuncu’s header is a hard one, hitting him and going over the bar. Excellent defending.83 min After hinting at doing something, Leicester have gone quiet again. Troubling times for them. 81 min Abraham finds Barkley after Evans carelessly sends him the ball, but Barkley can only lash wide. 78 min “If these drinks breaks become the norm,” emails Dave Manby, “why don’t they allow five subs per game as it is but only allow substitutions to happen at the drinks breaks and half time.”Because managers should be allowed to respond if there’s an injury, a goal, or a change in the balance of things. However the breaks do make me nervous – can we really trust the authorities not to call them timeouts, get them sponsored, and sell some more advertising space? 78 min Chelsea make their final change, Pedro on for Willian. 77 min Curious change from Leicester, Barnes off for Gray. It’s a strange one that, as Barnes has looked one of Leicester’s likelier sources of something. 76 min Nice from Barnes, jinking inside and finding Tielemans, who touches a clever ball back out to Chilwell, except it’s too clever for Chilwell. He’s on his heels, and can only bump it over the by-line. 74 min I’m not sure what I think of a final four comprising Man United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Man City. On the one hand, it should guarantee some sort of standard, but on the other, eff eff ess.73 min Another change for Chelsea, Loftus-Cheek replacing Pulisic, who’s done well – I assume he’s being saved for West Ham in midweek, and has a calf situation too, because the physio is applying ice.71 min Better from Leicester, Choudhury into Barnes, who finds a clever pass into Vardy, near the penalty spot, and for a second this looks a good chance. But the time it takes to swivel allows legs to get in the road, and the ensuing shot is blocked by some of them. It’s absolutely caning down with rain now. 68 min And that’s ... er ... drinks. Leicester need to make themselves inspirable, because Brendan is going to do his thing. 67 min Back to the goal, credit to Lampard for not hanging about waiting to make changes – I guess credit to the rich-club favouring five subs rule too – and getting the personnel right too. 66 min Leicester have nothing as Chelsea keep coming, a lush first touch from Pulisic sending him driving towards the box. He lays off to Barkley, opening the angle for him to curl towards the far post, but he doesn’t get enough angle so can only bring it back into Schmeichel’s midriff.That was coming, and coming from that man too! Willian and Azpilicueta exchange passes down the right – gosh, Willian has so much time, ticking away the moments that make up a dull day, fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way – crossing towards the near post area, where Barkley arrives to sweep a caress into the far corner! That was extremely Lampardian. 62 min Chelsea are right on top now and looking especially dangerous down their right, where Barkley and Willian are combining to decent effect. Again, the former finds the latter, whose low cross is aimed at the nearest available set of shins, Antonio Valencia-style. 60 min Brendan Rodgers hasn’t beaten Chelsea in 14 attempts. Sorry, I mean Brendan’s Rodgers’ players haven’t beaten Chelsea in 14 attempts60 min Chilwell bounces down the left and mishits a cross which clips the top of the bar and goes behind. 60 min At Vicarage Road, Danny Ings has given Southampton the lead. 58 min Rodgers has seen enough, replacing Praet and Perez and with Choudhury and Albrighton. I was slightly surprised Praet got in ahead of Choudhury to begin with, and wonder if Pulisic might soon be clutching some part of himself. 57 min Leicester are struggling to get out, but here they come down the right, Justin clipping a cross into the middle that Tielemans collects on the volley, looking to bring it into his stride. But he doesn’t quite connect with the right bit of foot and the ball runs away from him. 55 min And again! Pulisic is taking up some great positions in front of the Leicester back four and again he sticks Abraham him, Abraham swivelling to crack a fine low finish across Schmeichel and into the net. But again, the flag goes up. 53 min Chelsea are moving. Kovacic wins the ball and finds Pulisic, who slides in the Rabbi, but the flag goes up.

Watford are deep in trouble and lucky that everyone else around them is also playing like a drain. Southampton were excellent in all areas and two-goal Danny Ings was deadly. A superb free-kick from James Ward-Prowse capped it all off just when when Watford thought they had a foothold.90+2 min: Watford mount some attacking and then there’s a nasty collision between Deeney and Ings. Both men get up, and Watford have a corner. That’s cleared by a Saints defence that’s excelled aside from Bednarek’s OG, and that was one of those where he couldn’t actually do anything else.90 min: Five minutes added and only Southampton appear capable of adding to their total.89 min: Che Adams burst through, blazing past Dawson and looked on to score his first ever goal for Southampton, only for the ball to come off Foster’s leg and away. That’s followed up by Nathan Redmond rattling the post. Watford torn asunder.86 min: That 9-0 loss to Leicester seems a long time ago for Southampton. Credit due to Saints for keeping the faith, and contrast that with Watford being on their third manager. The momentum Nigel Pearson built up on his arrival is lost on this evidence.85 min: This has been smash and grab from Southampton. Each of their goals has been expertly executed. Their quality has been far too high for Watford.83 min: There is another thunderstorm brewing and it’s called Nigel Pearson, defining the term ‘face like thunder’. There is a thunderstorm brewing, and James Ward-Prowse has the chance to reopen the two-goal lead. In David Beckham style he whips it up, over and into the net. Watford’s comeback lasted less than 180 seconds. Holebas’ cross from the wing came in and Welbeck was ready to score. Bednarek stepped across him only to direct the ball into his own net. Game on. 78 min: Another injury. Stuart Armstrong has been hurt. While he is attended to, a final Watford change. Femenia off, and young Argentinian Pussetto on.76 min: Watford, flush with those changes, try to push on for victory but all that results in is another dangerous Southampton attack. Welbeck has to come all the way back to clear the danger. There was a melee in the Saints box where Walker-Peters looked to have committed an offence but VAR waves that away.74 min: Saints change off goes Shane Long, on comes Che Adams. 73 min: Triple change: Welbeck, Joao Pedro and Holebas on, Masina, Hughes and Pereyra off. They have a mountain to climb. 72 min: Nigel Pearson, perhaps aware the camera is on him, is trying his best to look calm but his blood must be boiling at the way his team have let him down. They have worked hard but been guilty of two disastrous mistakes. 71 min: Danny Ings is just a goal behind Jamie Vardy in the Premier League scoring charts. And he looks red hot at the moment. Two glimmers, two goals. And he’s got time for a hat-trick yet.Straight from the drinks and Ben Foster makes a terrible mistake, launching the ball straight at Danny Ings, who burrows towards goal and smashes. Another fine goal from him, more horrendous defending from Watford.67 min: Southampton have not been great in midfield or attack this half. They are relying too heavily on their defence. And they will be glad of the second-half water break. 65 min: Saints sub: off comes Smallbone who did well in the first 45 for Stuart Armstrong. 64 min: Sarr is wasteful this time. Howls of anguish from his teammates, including most loudly Troy Deeney. 62 min: More Watford pressure and two more corners. Saints are holding up well, back in numbers. Hasenhuttl is doing the organising from his technical area.61 min: Watford corner earned by the ever more prominent Pereyra. The ball comes to Hughes who volleys into a crowd of players. Deeney couldn’t find space for a shot. Then Doucoure has a shot. It flies off for a throw. Deeney is not amused once more.59 min: Nigel Pearson yet to make a sub. His option are sat in the Vicarage Road stand at the moment, none of them warming up. His first XI are pushing on but with not much quality. 56 min: Watford really pushing on, with Will Hughes to the fore. Southampton are sticking to their task, and Walker-Peters intervenes to concede a corner that Pereyra makes a mess of.53 min: Troy Deeney is not amused. Bednar and Vestergaard have dished it out to him and he’s found it hard to dish much back. 52 min: Southampton find a bid of attacking impetus. Hasenhuttl is doing more talking already this half, perhaps recognising the signs of Watford’s improvement. 50 min: Danny Welbeck warms up as Sarr is attended to but the Senegalese forward will be ok to continue, though with something of a limp. 48 min: Correction, that was a goal kick rather than corner. But Watford push on again before Sarr collapses under a heavy tackle from Bertrand. Saints play on and Ings aims at the back stick but Long fails to get there.46 min: Watford start with purpose as if their manager might have said something at half-time. Pereyra takes a free-kick from the right. It comes out to Sarr who his shot blocked. Pereyra and Femenia have crosses blocked. Troy Deeney forces a corner.We are back and Nigel Pearson was one of the last to the dugout. JR in Illinois reports in: “The quieter Nigel Pearson is the scarier he seems to be, and right now he’s looking scary AF. He’s going to want to fight someone at halftime. And he will win that fight. Newcastle should buy Smallbone and put him in midfield with the Longstaff brothers to give them some balance.”Poor from Watford, and very good from Saints. Watford have been unable to put anything together as Southampton have smothered them. Danny Ings supplied the sole moment of class for the goal.45+3 min: A few heads shaking from Watford players. They should be further behind on the balance of play though their defenders, aside from the goal, have done their job well enough.45+2 min: Masina defends a cross well but has to concede a corner to do so. Saints again fail to make much of the dead ball. 45 min: Four minutes added on to a half of plenty of stoppages. 44 min: Troy Deeney is breathing heavily with fatigue and exasperation. It’s muggy out there. And Southampton have done a number on Watford.43 min: Shane Long and Craig Cathcart clash, and there’s a rude word spoken. Long did not like his treatment by the Northern Irishman. 42 min: Sarr continues to be the danger man but decides to try and get a penalty from the referee rather than beating Ryan Bertrand to the byline. Watford’s thinking in attacking situations has not been too good. 40 min: Smallbone, who has been impressive, plays an elegant ball to the left as Saints turn the screw on Watford, who have been poor and look to be hanging on until half-time.39 min: Troy Deeney is down after Vestergaard smashed into the back of him. He gets back up to help defend a free-kick, taken of course by Ward-Prowse but Ben Foster claims well. 37 min: Ward-Prowse the latest in the wars, having been banged in the face. Romeu had to go off and come back on again with his bloody nose. 36 min: Watford have looked like a team missing something, namely perhaps the three wallies who attended a party against the regulations. They are also without Gerard Deulofeu of course.

But I’ve got no recall of being critically ill it because I was in an induced coma. I’m only finding out now how the NHS saved my life while I was in intensive care for nearly seven weeks.The NHS is an incredible feat of the imagination – complete strangers care for you and this means that it is social medicine and social health at its best.My earliest memory is sitting on a beach. I was two and a half. I can remember sitting there, with my legs apart, looking at the sand. It’s hot and I’m not very happy.I’m the child who came after. There was a baby who was born between me and my elder brother, and he died. I only found this out when I was 11. My mother was very protective of me. If my dad or my brother took the mickey out of me, she’d say: “Leave him alone, he’s tired.”I was a massively happy child. My brother and I were given a huge amount of freedom to go off and play outside. Yet my parents were also very concerned, some might say over-concerned – they poured over every detail of our lives, our homework, our hobbies and so on. I felt total unconditional love from both of them.The closest I ever came to death, before Covid-19, was when I was 17. I was walking along the wrong side of an unlit road and a car hit me, breaking my pelvis and my leg. A few inches to the left or right, I would have been a goner. I rolled into a ditch and the driver drove on. Later, he went to the police, who couldn’t find me. They were just about to leave when they heard me talking in the ditch. I was apparently wide awake, talking. But I’ve lost this from my memory. It’s completely gone.Most people would be surprised to learn how much a football match can matter to me. I can watch a match and feel my heartbeat racing. And if Arsenal lose, I can feel completely devastated. It’s pathetic – it can ruin a whole weekend. I’ve been arrested twice. Once was for demonstrating against the Vietnam War in 1968 and pushing against the police in front of the American Embassy. The second time was for occupying a hairdresser’s, because the hairdresser was operating a colour bar and refusing to cut black people’s hair. I was charged with obstruction and had to pay £2 fine.If I could go back in time, I’d visit the period between 1900 and 1914. There was a huge revolution then in ideas and thought around psychology, literature and art. Everyone thought they’d learned from the lessons of the terrible wars of the 19th century, that war in Europe could never happen again. I’d live in the optimism and excitement of that time, just before the First World War.I don’t mind getting older. I’m 74 now, and people keep discovering me, which is very nice.

I didn’t know and couldn’t see that he had the beginnings of septicaemia. Then I went to bed. I was the only one in the house. I can still see that moment I said goodnight to him for the last time, I can see that just in front of me. These moments are split seconds. The fragility of life is recognisable in them.It helps me to think about my son’s death as something that happens to living people and things. I place it in that category, as part of the inevitable biology of us. My feelings about him, my sense of loss… I’ve separated them off.I cried when I was researching my book, The Missing – realising that if my French relatives had just had a few more hours, they would have got on the boat and been safe from the Nazis. I discovered that a teacher in the French village where my uncle Martin was arrested is taking children to a local museum, to show them pictures of Martin. The idea that I’ve contributed to a bit of Holocaust education in rural France is, I think, my greatest achievement.I get arrangementitis. It happens to me when I’ve got so many arrangements, so many timings, so many possibilities of trains and timetables. I can get overwhelmed by that. It’s not the rushing, so much as the thinking ahead about all the many things I’m doing over the next few days, and it just sort of piles up. It can make me feel weary, like I’ve got a mountain to climb. It gives me a funny kind of tired feeling just underneath my eyes.I am an optimist, definitely. There’s no point in pessimism, because all that happens is you feel pessimistic – and then you die. You’ve wasted your life.

That it would have been my first is for me is matter of some regret as I have spent a long career trying to shoot a mix of all things British, and in particular iconic British events. How I managed to miss this festival is almost beyond me, given its significance in the British social calendar. I do have an excuse though, as the last weekend of June is always the AGM of Magnum, the cooperative that I am a member of, and I always felt obliged and keen to attend.So for the 50th festival I had planned to go, but as we all know it was cancelled. However, I thought it would be interesting to tour the site just before the festival would have opened, to see how it looks.I am being taken around by John from the press office, and the first thing to remember is that this is a large, busy and working farm. I photograph Steven, the farm manager, cleaning his tractor, and there are nearby piles of manure, and in front of the skeleton of the Pyramid stage is a large herd of friesian cows where normally you would see many thousands of dancing, waving festivalgoers.The other first impression is that the site is huge. This will not be news to regular attendees, but to this Glasto virgin it amazing to see the scale of it all. We pass the staff canteen, which serves 20,000 meals a day we see assorted landmark sites like the Greenpeace boat and the stone circle. We visit a site called Permaculture, where John picks some raspberries: normally at this time of year it would be a thriving market garden.All around the site are remains of the assorted attractions waiting to be brought back to life in a year’s time. There is a sense of melancholy about the whole site.We go back to base and meet Emily, and a few moments later Michael comes by in his bright red Land Rover. He is a pretty nimble 85-year-old. I explain I have taken his photo a few times and say the last time was when he opened a summer fete at an old people’s home in nearby Shepton Mallet. He says: ‘That’s the sort of thing I do!’ I shoot their portrait in front of the door to one of the farm barns.The tour continues and I go to an area with dozens of skips and many refuse lorries, a reminder that at the festival peak this is a community of more than a quarter of a million people, with all the servicing this entails. There are piles of old oil barrels which are the litter bins, which are freshly painted every year but are now looking a bit sad. I go to the festival workshop barn, where Rob is employed year-round to build and maintain the festival infrastructure.I hope to be back next year, to see the real thing in full operation, but I am grateful to have had this chance to first see the lay of the land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/534572bf1956f2f6e6f6e6b2626bed6e53ce8a3e/0_301_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2b6555f2cf3e6517f54e05945e125af","title":"nadine shah kitchen sink review razor sharp observations","story":"(Infectious)The singer-songwriter’s follow-up to Holiday Destination is a slow-burning joyNorth-eastern singer-songwriter Nadine Shah won acclaim – and a Mercury prize nomination – for her 2017 album, Holiday Destination, in part because she was one of the few artists to actually attempt to address Europe’s refugee crisis. The follow-up is just as political, but this time the focus is more personal, as she considers what it means to be a thirtysomething woman today: is it “wrong” that at 34 she is neither married nor a mother?Any fears that this is going to be po-faced navel-gazing are dispelled by the brass-powered opener, Club Cougar, about a relationship with someone “one year younger – call me a cougar”. A seam of such lyrical boldness runs throughout Kitchen Sink, which is offset nicely by the taut post-punk backing, made once again with longtime foil Ben Hillier. Ladies for Babies (Goats for Love) is a case in point, musically as austere as Rid of Me-era PJ Harvey, but blessed with razor-sharp observations (“He wants his lady To be a lady To care less, be hairless All he wants in fairness Is a baby”) and a very direct chorus. In that respect, it’s something of an outlier – there’s little else here that is as immediate.

Now a new telescope could confirm their belief and change solar system scienceYou’d think that if you found the first evidence that a planet larger than the Earth was lurking unseen in the furthest reaches of our solar system, it would be a big moment. It would make you one of only a small handful of people in all of history to have discovered such a thing.But for astronomer Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, it was a much quieter affair. “It wasn’t like there was a eureka moment,” he says. “The evidence just built up slowly.”He’s a master of understatement. Ever since he and his collaborator Chad Trujillo of Northern Arizona University, first published their suspicions about the unseen planet in 2014, the evidence has only continued to grow. Yet when asked how convinced he is that the new world, which he calls Planet X (though many other astronomers call it Planet 9), is really out there, Sheppard will only say: “I think it’s more likely than unlikely to exist.”As for the rest of the astronomical community, in most quarters there is a palpable excitement about finding this world. Much of this excitement centres on the opening of a giant new survey telescope named after Vera C Rubin, the astronomer who, in the 1970s, discovered some of the first evidence for dark matter.Scheduled to begin its full survey of the sky in 2022, the Rubin observatory could find the planet outright or provide the clinching circumstantial evidence that it’s there.Discovery of the planet would be a triumph, but also a disaster for existing theory about how the solar system was created.“It would change everything we thought we knew about planet formation,” says Sheppard, in another characteristic understatement. In truth, no one has a clue how such a large planet could form that far from the sun.The distant solar system is a place of darkness and mystery. It encompasses an enormous volume of space that begins at the orbit of Neptune, some 30 times further from the sun than Earth, or 30 astronomical units (AU)the , and extends to about 100,000AU. That’s almost one-third of the distance from the sun to the next nearest star.It was in the inner regions of this volume that American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto in 1930. Although Pluto possessed just two-thirds of the diameter of our moon, it was originally classed as a planet.By the end of the century, however, telescopes were bigger and astronomers were beginning to find more tiny worlds beyond Neptune. They were all even smaller than Pluto until 2005, when Mike Brown from the California Institute of Technology discovered Eris. It was at least the same size as Pluto and probably bigger, so, if Pluto was a planet, so was Eris. Nasa hastily organised a press conference and announced the discovery of Planet 10.About a year later, the International Astronomical Union ruled that Pluto and Eris were effectively too small to be called planets and renamed them dwarf planets. So the solar system’s roll-call returned to eight: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. And a cottage industry of finding distant solar system objects really got going.The path towards Planet 9 began one night in 2012, when Sheppard and Trujillo were using the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory’s telescope in Chile. They were finding more and more distant objects, but one in particular stood out. Catalogued as 2012 VP113, they nicknamed it Biden after the US vice-president at the time (because of the letters VP in the catalogue designation). To their amazement, this far-flung world never came closer to the sun than about 80AU. At its furthest, Biden would reach 440AU into deep space, meaning that it followed a highly elliptical orbit. But that wasn’t the most remarkable thing about it.By some weird coincidence, its orbit appeared to be very similar to that of another distant world known as Sedna. This mini-world had been discovered in 2003 by Brown, Trujillo and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. It immediately stood out because of its highly elliptical orbit, which swings from 76AU to 937AU.“Objects like Sedna and 2012 VP113 can’t form on these eccentric orbits,” says Sheppard. Instead, computer simulations suggest that they form much closer and are then ejected by gravitational interactions with the larger planets. The truly odd thing, however, was that the two elongated orbits pointed in roughly the same direction.And the more Sheppard and Trujillo examined the other objects in their catch, the more they saw that those orbits were aligned, too. It was as if something was corralling those tiny worlds, like a sheepdog manoeuvring its flock. And the only thing they could think of that was capable of doing that was a much larger planet.Curiosity piqued, they did some calculations and discovered that the planet their results were hinting at had to be somewhere between two and 15 times more massive than Earth, on an orbit that lies on average somewhere between 250AU and 1500AU from the sun. Their results were published by the prestigious journal Nature in March 2014 and interest in Planet 9 began to sweep the astronomical world.The next big leap came in 2015 when Sheppard and Trujillo were among the scientists who discovered 2015 TG387. They nicknamed this one the Goblin. It’s the third most extreme object behind Sedna and Biden and it, too, lines up, reducing still further the idea that this alignment is a random coincidence.In 2016, Brown and his collaborator Konstantin Batygin, also of Caltech, published their own analysis of the data. Agreeing with Sheppard and Trujillo about the size and distance of the planet, they even suggested an area of sky where they thought it might be found.But not everyone is convinced.Pedro H Bernardinelli, a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, realised that Sheppard’s data wasn’t the only place one could look for distant worldlets. So he turned to some initial data from a cosmological survey that was designed to measure the way in which the universe is expanding by looking at far-away galaxies. He searched the data for the celestial equivalent of a photobomb, looking for distant solar system objects that just happened to get in the way of the camera. He found seven.At first sight, it looked as if these worldlets were also aligned as expected, but the more rigorously Bernardinelli analysed the data, the weaker he felt the alignment became. “We don’t think we see the signal in our data,” says Bernardinelli, although he admits the he can’t yet definitely rule out the planet and has yet to run the analysis on the full survey data. “Our answer might change the next time we do this,” he says.These days, Sheppard can regularly be found using Japan’s Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, patiently scouring the sky for more evidence of Planet 9, maybe even hoping that he sees the planet itself. The scale of the task is enormous. It really is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The planet – if it is even there – is very faint and the sky is very large. But help is on its way in the form of the Rubin observatory.Rubin is a monster that will devour the sky. Whereas most telescopes would take months or years to survey the whole sky, Rubin will do it in just three nights. Then do it again and again and again to see what’s changed and so catch the moving objects.Construction is nearing completion, and the telescope is set to open its giant eye for the first time later this year. Commissioning and tweaking will then take another couple of years.“That survey is going to change solar system science as we know it,” says Sheppard. And if Planet 9 is out there, Rubin should see it.“We can detect an Earth-mass planet at around 1000 AU,” says Meg Schwamb, of Queen’s University Belfast, who co-chairs the Rubin observatory’s solar system science collaboration. That puts Sheppard’s world easily within its sights. “If others haven’t seen Planet 9 before our survey starts then, I think, all eyes are on the Rubin observatory,” says Schwamb.Even if the telescope fails to see the planet directly, it will detect many more distant mini-worlds that can all be use to triangulate the planet’s position more precisely, thus helping to narrow the search area. And if Planet 9 really is out there, then the consequences will be huge. Astronomers think that the solar system formed in a disc of matter surrounding the sun. That matter condensed into smaller bodies, which then collided to form larger ones. At the end of this process, the planets were born. But the matter in this disc thins out further from the sun, meaning there is not enough raw material to form a large planet in the distant solar system.To rescue the standard theory, some suggest that Planet 9 was once destined to become a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn and so was forming alongside them. However, a gravitational interaction stunted its growth by hurling it out into the dark.But Jakub Scholtz of Durham University is sceptical. “It’s possible,” he says, “but it actually requires quite a lot of coincidences.” That’s because a single gravitational interaction can’t do the job. Instead, a series of interactions is needed to place it in an orbit that never brings it back to where it formed.Scholtz has a more exotic idea. Together with collaborator James Unwin, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, he has suggested that the object corralling these distant worldlets is not a long-lost planet but a black hole.If so, not even Rubin will be able to see it, because black holes emit no light whatsoever – they simply swallow light and anything else that happens to cross their path. It is a tantalising possibility because Scholtz’s black hole would have to be part of a long-suspected but never-proved population of black holes that were formed shortly after the formation of the universe.But for the time being, most other astronomers seem more than content with the idea that there’s a large planet out there in the darkness, just waiting to come into view in the next few years.And if Planet 9 really is there, then perhaps the first time Sheppard sees it through a telescope, he will finally experience something akin to a eureka moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e32ad6a9c080e341b7a07f4d31221f61822718/0_38_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd0fc58f648d2312c27a85c352d26f85","title":"black trans lives matter march in london in pictures","story":"Thousands of transgender people and supporters gathered in London to raise awareness about the discrimination and prejudices the black transgender community faces.

That is why the actor turned politician is leading a push for the government to save the sector, which he said was weeks from oblivion.“I’ve worked in pretty much every theatre in the country, not once but on several occasions,” he said. “In 55 years of being a touring actor, you take it all in. But all these wonderful theatres, cultural centres, which bring the performing arts to the people – we are in danger of losing them, and we are in danger of losing them now.”Watling, who also worked as a director and theatre manager before becoming the MP for Clacton in 2017, has met Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, to make his case for an emergency rescue package.The government has published a “roadmap” to get theatres and other live venues running again after coronavirus, but it contained no promises of new money to tide the sector over.With even some larger venues such as the Theatre Royal Plymouth and Newcastle Theatre Royal planning likely wholesale redundancies, Watling argued a rescue plan was ideally needed within days rather than weeks.“We need an announcement of some serious support for the theatre sector,” said the MP, who has also written to Boris Johnson. “We just need to know that something’s coming so that people keep going through these very hard times. Because there are theatres closing.“A second thing we really need to know is a date, a plan for opening our theatres. If nothing is done by August, then the panto season goes. And, as we all know, the panto season is something that puts money into theatres and supports the rest of the arts.”Becoming a politician was something of a late career change for Watling, 67, who along with his theatre work is probably best known for a regular role in the 1980s BBC sitcom Bread, and is almost certainly the only politician to have to quit a touring production of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, to fight a byelection.Starting out as a child actor on the ITV police drama Gideon’s Way, Watling spent many school holidays on the road with his father, the actor Jack Watling. He later spent a period in the 70s and 80s running the tiny Frinton Summer Theatre, based in a hall just up the coast from Clacton, describing it as “a hand-to-mouth operation” even at the best of times.“You get out and sell the advertising in the programme, you put on the best plays you can for the money available,” he said. “And you pray that the audience is coming. It still has a very loyal audience, but it just will not survive without help.”It is, Watling noted, a long way from big London theatres: “I suspect the West End will survive. It’ll be impoverished, but it will come through. You have the Palladium with 2,000 seats. If you have 1,000 people, and you charge a little bit more – and they will pay in the West End – you can probably make it.”Watling is urging ministers to consider the long-term cultural impact of losing theatres like that in Frinton, where actors including Antony Sher made their debuts, as well as the economic boost from overseas cultural capital.“Under the late Derek Nimmo, I toured the world,” he said. “We played to packed houses everywhere we went, and they were looking at British theatre, British values. It’s extraordinarily valuable, much more valuable than £13.7bn it’s worth on paper.”Watling, who met Dowden on Wednesday, said he hoped ministers were listening: “People are beginning to understand just how valuable this is, and how how much in danger it is. And how historically important it is. Ever since the time of Shakespeare, we’ve been exporting the English language and English values across the world, through our theatre. And we’ve now come to a point where Rome is burned around us – the theatres are closing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39042ea1e52c6d2add0daca9a0b3844772e1609a/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ca105f5514f20dd82ec108aa09e3cdee","title":"the big picture girl in the dust somerset","story":"For photographer Dave Watts, it’s as if family life has gone back in time a little since the pandemic hit…During lockdown, family life has sometimes established a different time and space. Dave Watts took this photograph of his daughter Minna, five, on the daily walk he and his wife, Frances, a landscape artist, have taken with their three young children. Watts and his family live on the edge of a town in Somerset, where he works as a commercial photographer, but when jobs dried up in April and the kids were home from school the days took on a less predictable, sometimes magical shape, one he has tried to capture.“There is a network of footpaths and we fell into doing the same route every day,” he says. “Probably about a mile and a half, always quite a leisurely pace. The children got into the habit of stopping in the same places to play. Because it was at the end of such a long dry spell, this place was dusty and Minna loved that she throws herself into being busy and messy.”In some ways, shrinking horizons have perhaps taken children across the country back in time a little – with not much traffic on the roads, and long days to fill.Watts started his career as a travel photographer based in London, before moving back to Somerset, near his childhood home, when his eldest child was born. The weeks of relative confinement have been a bittersweet time, he suggests – the fears and liberation of an empty schedule. The family has been sustained in part by Frances selling some work through the Artist Support Pledge. “To start with there was a lot of anxiety, with the pandemic and the lack of income, but then there were also these lovely sunny days outside with the kids,” Watts says.

For Jason Chambers, an associate professor of advertising at the University of Illinois, this question has driven his life’s work.As reckonings around racism in the US grow, a new focus has emerged: decolonizing the American supermarket. Last week, a bevy of multinational food and drink conglomerates, including PepsiCo (which owns Aunt Jemima) and ConAgra Foods (which owns Mrs Butterworth’s), announced major changes to brands that many shoppers have long felt uncomfortable supporting. These include Aunt Jemima, who many have long argued is a racist “mammy figure”, the “happy black cook” figurehead on Uncle Ben’s rice (owned by Mars Inc), and the perceived racist packaging of Mrs Butterworth’s. Cream of Wheat has also announced a review of its mascot.But what about the other legacy entities in America popularized through harmful images? Land O’Lakes butter retired its indigenous maiden character in April, but will the Washington Redskins change their mascot? Here, Chambers, the author of Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry, addresses branding built on harmful stereotypes and what needs to happen next.What was your reaction to the news of Aunt Jemima changing its name and packaging? My immediate reaction was relief. It’s an absolute shame that it took them this long.The racist ideologies and caricatures embedded in Aunt Jemima have long been criticized. Why do you believe PepsiCo was so resistant to the change?Quite honestly, they’ve had the money and the brand visibility to withstand it. Until now. When you’re talking about changing a brand name or trade character, you’re talking about magnitudes of change. Things companies have spent decades and tens of millions of dollars establishing. So who wants to be the first person to walk into the room and say, ‘You know the decision I think you should make for social or humanistic reasons?’ Then, with this current movement, PepsiCo saw that maybe the brand wouldn’t withstand the current sociopolitical conversations happening.Did you think other brands, including Uncle Ben’s and Mrs Butterworth’s, would follow as quickly as they did?Once the biggest domino has fallen, the one that’s the most visible, people will then gradually move down the food chain and ask, “What other brands are conveying similar racist imagery?”Is there historical precedent when it comes to a high-selling brand making large-scale changes to become less “problematic”? The one my mind jumps back to immediately – when discussing parallels of trade characters – is the Frito Bandito character PepsiCo had from 1967 to 1971. Frito Bandito played into these stereotypes of a sombrero-wearing, Mexican cowboy who robbed people of their Fritos. Mexican American activists spoke out against Bandito and it took about four years for the character to finally be retired. There were some strong similarities between Frito Bandito and Aunt Jemima in that both were recognizable, popular, and a success in the eyes of the advertising and marketing sectors.Why does the food sector in particular have such a race problem?I call it “ethnicity as authenticity”. If you consider a stereotype as something being based in a perception such as “black people aren’t good at anything but music, cooking, and sports”, there is a certain authenticity that comes with that perception. So you take the myth of the south and the happy black woman cooking for the white family, and suddenly you have a product that gains more “authenticity” through that image and, as a result, sells more.Is there another product or brand that should be nervous right now? I hope a sports team like the Washington Redskins will stop standing behind a line like, “Well, this is what we’ve always been called.” That they look at these other brands and see they can withstand a name change. No one is going to forget you are based in Washington or what you’ve been named. But you can be called something else. My question is, why fight it any longer? Why not get on the right side of this discussion and be held up as an example of a company or organization that finally listened to consumers?Various brands have posted statements in support of Black Lives Matter. Do you view this as a positive development? I hope the words of these companies are matched by their deeds. And by that I mean doing more than donating money. It’s about opening up opportunities for recruitment, retention, promotion within the company and asking hard questions of yourself. Otherwise, the statements are just empty words. So if you post a statement, you better be prepared to make changes within your organization. Should black consumers be wary of Black Lives Matter being co-opted by brands in a similar fashion to Pride?I hope the movement stays organic to activists and the people who have been part of it from the very beginning. Having these companies join the conversation helps, in a way. It normalizes the argument of the movement. It shows we are united on this topic and that there is a problem regarding the problem of race and policing.But after posting a viral statement is when the hard work starts. When I tell you, OK, to change this, this is going to cost a lot of money and cause a cultural change and be a lot of hard work – now how do you feel about it? That’s when we’ll see if real change takes place or not.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3b0650cc3243a187e152bb76abc783696cb5b0/0_0_3424_2054/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e6bf965809b0d50b793250ea8f40968","title":"republican democratic conventions 2020 us election florida","story":"Democrats announced a mostly-virtual national convention but Republicans are attempting not to sacrifice spectacle in the toss-up stateEvery four years, Democrats and Republicans stage their national conventions, huge primetime events at which presidential nominations are formally bestowed amid cascades of balloons, in front of cheering crowds.On 20 August, a little more than two months before election day, Joe Biden will duly accept the Democratic nomination in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A week later, Donald Trump will be crowned by Republicans in Jacksonville, Florida.Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, almost everything else will not proceed as usual. But the two parties will follow radically different paths.This week, as the US death toll passed 124,000 and cases surged in many states, Democrats announced a slimmed-down convention, mostly online and with physical events staged under guidance from public health experts. Biden’s speech, for example, has been moved to a smaller venue.Republicans have also made big changes, but for a different reason. Despite the pandemic racing through America, they are attempting not to sacrifice spectacle in the name of public safety.The Republican convention was set for Charlotte, North Carolina. But Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor, would not allow what is in effect a huge campaign rally – crowds packed tight in a sports arena – in the shadow of Covid-19.As a result, party business will be conducted in Charlotte with public health restrictions but Jacksonville will now host made-for-TV events not subject to mandatory social distancing, mask-wearing or other measures.In Wisconsin, Democrats are working with Tony Evers, a governor from their own party who has sought to prioritize the fight against the virus. In Florida, the governor, Ron DeSantis, is a prominent Trump supporter who has championed economic reopening.Tara Setmayer, a Republican operative and Trump critic, told the : “The simple version of why lots of people will be brought into Jacksonville in the middle of a pandemic is this Republican need to appear committed to reopening and not to mandate safety measures.“Everything that the Republican party does now is a play for the base. There’s no other logical explanation because the Democrats have had enough sense to make the proper adjustments and go virtual, to adhere to the government’s own standards for social distancing and things like that.“There’s a lot involved logistically to control a national convention. It costs tens of millions of dollars. You bring in multiple police agencies to coordinate. It’s a Herculean effort.”“So the Democrats understood it’s not worth risking the health and exposure of all these people and the logistical nightmare you would create. Whereas Donald Trump and the Republican party seem not to give a damn about the health and safety of the people involved. And that is incredibly self-centered and politically craven.”But it may be politically necessary for Trump. Heralding the decision to go to Jacksonville, the Republican National Committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, cited the economic benefit to the city but also pointed to the hard political realities that govern any choice of convention location.Florida, McDaniel said, “is crucial in the path for victory in 2020”.Four months out from the election, the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia rates four states as toss-ups between Biden and Trump: Arizona, North Carolina, Florida and Wisconsin.Trump won them all in 2016 and in all likelihood will have to do so again. Much can change but by the UVA count, excluding the toss-ups, Biden has 268 likely electoral college votes to 204 for Trump. A candidate needs 270 to win.“Florida’s a must-win but so’s North Carolina,” said Larry Sabato, director of the UVA Center for Politics. “Lose either, and Trump’s probably lost the election.”The Democrats’ choice of venue was governed by similar political concerns, but their outlook now looks much brighter.“Wisconsin looked like the pivot state,” Sabato said. “There’s always one. If it goes one way then Trump wins, if it goes the other way, then Biden wins. So that’s why the Democrats put it in Wisconsin. It was one of the great shocks of 2016. They figured they could get Michigan back without doing a convention there and I think they were right, and the same with Pennsylvania.“Wisconsin was the tough one – they thought.”Such concern can hit turnout. Last weekend, Trump returned to the campaign trail in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city and state badly hit by Covid-19. The rally attracted a small crowd and staffers tested positive.Setmayer and other observers point to the insensitivity of such timing. However, Dr Michael Binder of the University of North Florida noted that conventions are by their nature “polarizing events” and said that “under the backdrop of a global pandemic that appears to have come more fervently to Florida, the opposition to this event being hosted locally seems much more concerning”.The two would-be presidents are not the only people who will be watching the polls into August. Sabato said polling in North Carolina showed support for Cooper in his confrontation with Trump. Setmayer pointed to a fall in support for Jacksonville’s mayor, Lenny Curry, since the Republicans announced they were coming to town. DeSantis is widely said to be eyeing a presidential run in four years’ time.Last month, Politico reported on how Trump attended George HW Bush’s nomination in New Orleans in 1988, saw how Republicans lionized him as, as Sabato put it, “a hero of history”, and told friends: “This is what I want.”In Jacksonville, he will demand such a spectacle. McDaniel, the party chair, has promised “a packed arena” and all the trimmings: balloons showering from the ceiling, bands, chants of the candidate’s name and the familiar mantra: “Four more years!”As public health officials continue to warn against large gatherings, particularly indoors, McDaniel has also promised “to make sure the convention-goers are safe”.But case numbers continue to surge in Florida. On Friday, DeSantis both announced a record daily caseload and finally ordered a pause in reopening. It is hard to see the situation being much better by August.“I just really don’t see the upside in the long term for Donald Trump,” Setmayer said. “He’ll personally get his adulation fix, but that’s all it’ll be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e8b124c4c0a2ca15314d9248bab2be500ecd6d/240_177_4553_2731/master/4553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a374cedb3f8b75408c07ec0794818a8c","title":"lgbt marches from london to new york call for end to racism","story":"Minorities claim that they are seen ‘as second-class citizens’ within their own communitiesAs thousands of people marched in support of Pride and racial justice globally this weekend, many demonstrators called for an end to often-overlooked racism within the LGBT+ community.Pride events to celebrate LGBT+ rights are held globally throughout June – although most were cancelled or moved online this year because of the coronavirus pandemic – but the emergence of protests over racial injustice spurred a series of live events.Studies show that LGBT+ people of colour are more prone to violence and poverty. And a 2018 StonewallYouGov survey also found more than half of Black, Asian and other minority LGBT+ Britons had experienced discrimination from members of their own community.“It’s still definitely pretty prevalent,” said Kwamina Theo Amihyia, joining a Black Trans Lives Matter march in London.“As far as we’ve come, a lot of the strides made have been for white members of the (LGBT+) community and we’re still seen almost as second-class citizens.”Racial inequalities globally have come under the microscope following the death of George Floyd, 46, in police custody in the United States on 25 May.Many LGBT+ groups released statements in support of protests after Floyd’s death, pointing out the radical origins of the LGBT+ rights movement at the Stonewall Inn in New York 51 years ago that emerged to fight police brutality.“As a queer person myself, I face racism from the queer community – and it’s time we stamped it out,” Patrick King said as he marched along one of central London’s main thoroughfares with car horns blaring. London’s Black Trans Lives Matter march was one of several events planned this weekend to support Black Lives Matter.With the debate over systemic racism also hitting LGBT+ businesses this month, Gay dating apps Grindr and Scruff removed ethnicity filters in response to protests for racial justice.College student Donald Arrington, 19, who was due to take part in an informal Pride march in Los Angeles on Sunday, said he had been rejected on LGBT+ dating apps because he was black.“It’s always, ‘Hey sorry, you’re good looking, but unfortunately, I don’t date black guys’,” said Arrington,On Sunday, thousands of people are expected to attend New York’s Queer Liberation March, an event moved online due to the coronavirus but then back to the streets after the protests against police brutality and racism after Floyd’s death.“There needs to be the element of people in the streets and popular revolt and outrage,” said Natalie James, co-founder of the Reclaim Pride Coalition, which is hosting the march. “There’s not really a substitute for it.”But Ed Brockenbrough, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the move by Pride organisations to adopt Black Lives Matter issues did not go far enough to address racism in the LGBT+ community.“Activism in black and brown queer communities has been happening for a long time without full buy-in from white gatekeepers of queer resources,” said Brockenbrough, whose research focuses on the challenges of LGBT+ people of colour.For Ted Brown, a veteran of Britain’s Gay Liberation Front (GLF) marching in London on Saturday, not enough has changed since he was out on the “scene” in the 1970s.“If you look around here, for example, I’m one of the few black people here … The LGBT+ community needs to look at themselves and find out how they can become more erse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa46964a5381954eb1d6962f5ecf28e84debbcbb/0_242_4824_2896/master/4824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b0c45ac7d269d3a0bda2bd0a57c0006","title":"coronavirus leicester england local lockdown","story":"Priti Patel confirms support is being provided to city after coronavirus flare-upsLeicester could be the first place in England to face local lockdown measures after a rise in coronavirus cases, as the home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed more support for the city.Around 650 people were found to have had the illness in the first two weeks of June, a quarter of all cases in the city so far. There have been outbreaks at food production facilities and five schools have closed.The Department of Health and Social Care has deployed four mobile testing units to the city and made thousands of home testing kits available. The local authority is asking people to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres and to wash their hands regularly.Asked on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show if Leicester would be the first place to have fresh measures applied, Patel said: “That is correct. We’ve seen flare-ups across the country in recent weeks. Just in the last three or four weeks in particular.“There was the example of a flare-up in one particular hospital over infection control. That is why we have a new mechanism, a joint biosecurity centre, which is very much geared up and is being developed to address local flare-ups.”“There will be support going into Leicester.”She said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had been in touch with cabinet ministers over the weekend to explain additional support on testing and more resources for the local authority.She said: “With local flare-ups it’s right that we have a localised solution in terms of infection control, social distancing, testing and many of the tools actually within the Public Health England space that will come together to control the virus and stop the spread.”The prime minister has said the government would pursue “whack-a-mole tactics” to try and curb the virus in specific places as the rest of the country comes out of lockdown.A report in the Sunday Times said the latest outbreak in Leicester followed reports of large crowds gathering outside takeaway restaurants.Prof Keith Neal, a professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said the messaging on local measures needed to be very clear.People “inside of the lockdown need to understand why they have been included”, he said, as well as the exact geographical boundaries if there is to be a distinction between a specific city and region.“Urban sprawl has allowed towns and cities to expand resulting in these areas often joining other areas who identify differently and do not see themselves as part of the expanding town or city,” he said.“Locking down at the regional level would be seen as unfair or worse as Leicester city has really very little to do with rural Lincolnshire. People do not identify with their regional boundaries and many would not actually know where they are.”Patel also took aim at the recent mass gatherings, including the Black Lives Matter demonstrations and celebrations for Liverpool FC wining the Premier League. They they should not have gone ahead, she said, because they risk spreading the virus.“Congratulations to Liverpool for winning but, even so, fans want to celebrate but they did not need to go to the football ground and congregate outside the stadium,” she said.“As much as people do want to be out right now, the weather is amazing, stick to the rules, follow the guidance. We’ve made it quite clear that six or more people … no one should be gathering with six or more people … but also when it comes to protests there are other ways people can explain their views and opinions.”She said the Black Lives Matters protests had legitimate opinions and the government did want to “right the wrongs”, but that protesting in the current situation would not help the country control the virus’s spread."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c6ab96e8aec91434d88f2f3a18996e8b8f5037/165_0_4387_2634/master/4387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dafce409bfd762df48590c561de1b2e","title":"french revolution remains discovered in walls of paris monument","story":"Experts believe up to 500 people guillotined in period may be buried in Chapelle ExpiatoireExperts believe the remains of up to 500 people guillotined during the French Revolution may be buried in the walls of a listed monument in Paris.The discovery blows apart the accepted historical account, which suggests the bodies of famous guillotinés, including Louis XV’s mistress Madame du Barry, Olympe de Gouges and Maximilien Robespierre, revolutionary architect of the Reign of Terror, were moved to the network of catacombs under the city.Now researchers are to examine the walls of the Chapelle Expiatoire, a classified monument near the Grands Boulevards dedicated to King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, after the discovery of bones in the wall cavities.Aymeric Peniguet de Stoutz, the chapel’s administrator, turned historical detective after he noticed curious anomalies in the walls between the columns of the lower chapel. Anxious not to damage the building’s foundations, the French authorities called in an archaeologist, who inserted a camera through the stones in the walls.In his report, archaeologist Philippe Charlier confirmed Peniguet de Stoutz’s hypothesis: “The lower chapel contains four ossuaries made of wooden boxes, probably stretched out with leather, filled with human bones,” he wrote. “There is earth mixed with fragments of bones.”The discovery has deepened the mystery of what really happened to the remains of les guillotinés. The Chapelle Expiatoire was built in the early 19th century at the site of the old Madeleine cemetery, a stone’s throw from the Place de la Révolution – now Place de la Concorde – where the guillotine was frequently used.The cemetery, closed in 1794 when it reportedly ran out of space, was one of four established in Paris to dispose of the victims of the guillotine.When Louis XVIII became king in 1814, he ordered the remains of his brother Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to be removed and interred at the Saint-Denis Basilica and commissioned the chapel in their memory.Peniguet de Stoutz has now requested further research at the Chapelle Expiatoire. “Until now, the chapel served only as a monument to the memory of the royal family, but we have just discovered that it is also a necropolis of the revolution,” he told Le Parisien."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c659d2a713e64c788a47de0e1e56c22f51bfde8a/0_300_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=94e59eb0c6656bbcd4d67e81d2765b61","title":"new zealands covid 19 isolation facilities under extreme stress review finds","story":"Country records biggest coronavirus case jump in two months after four returning travellers diagnosedA review of New Zealand’s managed isolation and quarantine facilities has found that the system is under “extreme stress” as more and more Kiwis return home. It came as four more returnees tested positive to Covid-19 in the biggest one-day jump in cases in two months.The review found “resources required to support the managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) function have failed to keep pace with the increased volume of returnees”.“The team found that the system, whilst not broken, is under extreme stress and is not readily able to respond to the increasing demands being placed upon it,” the review found.“This has resulted in a very dedicated team having to confront immediate issues with limited capacity to plan ahead,” the review said, adding that this was “impacting on staff wellbeing and the confidence that returnees have in the process”.The review was ordered by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, after reports of people mixing in isolation facilities and others leaving quarantine without having been tested for Covid-19.This included two women entering from the UK who were allowed to leave their accomodation on compassionate grounds without being tested. They drove from Auckland to Wellington before testing positive to Covid-19 and were the first positive cases in the country following the lifting of all restrictions except those on the border.The review said that sometimes the first people knew about mandatory quarantine on entering New Zealand was during their health check on arrival at the airport.“There is currently no written information provided to returnees prior to entry or a process to record their acknowledgement that they will be required to enter into the MIQ system,’’ the review said.On Sunday the country recorded its worst day for new Covid-19 infections in two months, announcing four positive tests.Health officials said the new cases had arrived from India and Nepal, with one transferred to hospital for care.“While today’s news that one of our recent cases is in hospital may be concerning to some, it is something the health system in New Zealand has remained prepared for,” the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said.“I want to reassure the wider community that this person is receiving good treatment from the team at Auckland City Hospital, who have previous experience of managing positive cases.”On Monday New Zealand introduced stricter measures to strengthen its border because of the volume of returning citizens, in what Ardern described as “this dangerous new phase”.This included renewing the health order mandating 14 days of quarantine, and ensuring that people arriving in New Zealand must have a negative Covid-19 test before leaving quarantine, and may be required to take multiple tests.New Zealand has closed its border to all but citizens and regular residents and now has 20 active cases, each of whom have been quarantined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41f1e82011aa21cd4e5c22fe0ed27d2b4d2853bf/0_329_4991_2996/master/4991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1414e60df80aa8da4cef0db55200b0cf","title":"voting begins poland presidential election as race tightens","story":" Conservative incumbent Andrzej Duda faces main challenge from liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafał TrzaskowskiVoting is under way in Poland’s presidential election, with the incumbent, Andrzej Duda, up against a field of challengers including the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski.Duda, who campaigned on a deeply conservative social agenda that was often laced with homophobia, is allied with Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which since coming to power in 2015 has clashed with Brussels over eroding the country’s rule of law. Opponents hope that if Duda is defeated, the legislative agenda of PiS could be stymied by presidential veto, and a new era of Polish politics would begin.A run-off would take place in two weeks time, and polls suggest a race between Duda and Trzaskowski would be extremely close, with no clear favourite.People were mostly voting in person, although they were required to wear masks at polling stations. In one region where coronavirus numbers are still high, people were ordered to vote by post. Poland has had about 34,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, significantly fewer than in many western European countries, and life in the country has largely been back to normal for the past month.“I voted for Trzaskowski of course. Why? For democracy, the judiciary and respect for minorities,” 66-year-old Joanna Ugniewska told Agence France-Presse, after casting her ballot in Warsaw. Much of Duda’s support comes from smaller towns and villages, which are traditional PiS strongholds.Duda’s campaign drew controversy for using homophobic rhetoric in an attempt to rally this conservative PiS base. He made a pledge to “defend children from LGBT ideology”, and compared the LGBT rights agenda to communism. He also sought to gain a last-minute boost with a visit to Washington on Wednesday for what was in effect an endorsement from Donald Trump. He did not, however, return with the concrete US commitments on increased troop numbers stationed in Poland he had hoped for.Trzaskowski has been a supporter of LGBT rights during his time as Warsaw mayor, but has tried to sidestep the issue during the campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse.

Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong.

I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

So I descended the northern cliff for a closer look at them.“I was not put off by its precipitous plunge and the boiling of the sea below, but made my way down cautiously, kicking my boots well in at every step. At about a hundred feet down I found myself at the flight-level of the puffins.“These gay little auks fly in wide ellipses between cliff and sea, seeming without purpose and indefinitely, but it is not easy to follow an inidual puffin for their whole circuit of a teeming merry-go-round.“They were flying so close to me today, within a yard or so, that I could see them glance at me as they passed. Their flight is quicker than one thinks for all its apparent whirring clumsiness, so that trying to note the permutation of their bill colours was like trying to read the title on a revolving gramophone record...”That was me, a mere half-century ago, a solitary young eccentric camped on a Blasket island and pursuing this trivial and risky impulse. Why not stay on the clifftop, lying among the sea-pinks, to watch them perch outside their burrows in the evening sun? I must have forgotten my binoculars. Puffins, one of many of the world’s declining seabirds, are receiving much more necessary and serious attention. Like others – petrels and shearwaters, for example – who visit land only to breed, nesting in burrows and crevices and using darkness to dodge their predators, they invite challenging questions. How many are there, where do they go in winter, and what threatens their populations?The latest report on our breeding seabirds, from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, speaks of the “cryptic breeding ecology” of this 20 per cent of burrow-nesters and waits on the results of ongoing surveys.In the last big census attempt, Seabird 2000, many Irish islands proved too hard to land on or were beyond the capacity to organise. Puffins, in particular, were nesting on dangerously steep slopes and inaccessible clifftops. Playing tapes of recorded calls brought responses from most of the “apparently occupied burrows”, numbering more than 16,000.Since then, more intensive and hi-tech surveys by researchers at University College Cork suggest that some population figures for burrow-nesters have been gross underestimates. UCC’s Gavin Arneill and a fieldwork team found almost 4,000 pairs of storm petrels nesting on High Island, off Connemara, compared with the Seabird estimate of 22.UCC’s Dr Mark Jessop, an Australian zoologist, has worked with colleagues to track the winter travels of Irish puffins, their bright summer colours dulled or discarded. Tagging dispersing birds with GPS locators, he found puffins from Skellig Michael flying the Atlantic as far as Canada and Greenland to feed on shoals of oil-rich capelin.In 2017 came an international study, led by Oxford University and involving UCC, that had tracked 270 birds from 13 puffin colonies in North America, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Ireland. While US puffins migrated several hundred kilometres at most, birds from Ireland travelled up to 4,700km on return flights across the Atlantic.This, Jessop says, could leave the puffins too tired to breed when they arrive, barely able to lay one egg and forage food for a single chick. This could help to explain falling numbers at many Irish colonies.Floating on the tidesAnother recent study, by UCC researchers and the Zoological Society of London, found that puffins from colonies at the Saltee islands, Co Wexford, use strong tidal currents to float, rather than fly, between areas where they could e most successfully for sand eels. This saves them substantial energy.On the Great Saltee Island – a special area of conservation for birds – predation by rats has reduced breeding puffins from 2,000 to 50 birds. On the more remote and rat-free puffin cliffs, the main predators of eggs and chicks are the great black-backed gulls, breeding elsewhere on the island.Storm petrels and shearwaters return from fishing to feed their chicks under cover of darkness. But puffins bring beakfuls of sand-eels to the burrow by day and roost offshore at night. The single chick, however, takes its crucial first journey to the sea under darkness, having been left alone to get hungry.A witness to this was the Welsh ornithologist Ronald Lockley. In his classic Letters from Stockholm (1947), he told of measuring the period of the parents’ desertion by pushing matchsticks upright in the mouths of marked burrows.At length, in late July or August, several days after the last flattening of the matchsticks, the chicks emerged at night “to blunder onwards and downwards until they could at last flutter over the cliffs to the sea”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revolt"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: RAFPA WireThe Government is considering the purchase of military jet aircraft that would have the capacity to intercept high-altitude planes and fully police Irish skies. A new five-year Defence Forces investment strategy document has said that “future projects at a preplanning stage” include the potential for “air combat interceptors”. Such aircraft are designed to scramble quickly when there is a need to intercept unwelcome or unidentified planes which could include foreign military or hijacked airliners. Although no decisions have been made on whether to pursue such high-end military hardware, it would require a major financial commitment potentially running into hundreds of millions of euro.Expensive ground radar equipment would also be required to detect encroaching traffic in Irish airspace.“Consideration of Air Combat Interceptors would be dependent on additional funding,” the Defence Forces – Equipment Development Plan 2020-24 document, published on Friday, states. High-speed aircraftUnlike most EU countries, Ireland does not have the capacity to fully secure its airspace by intercepting high-speed aircraft. A Defence Forces spokesman said “such a capability is being kept under review, and is based on threat assessment, but budget has not been allocated for this at this time. Such an aircraft would be capable of policing all airborne craft in Irish sovereign airspace, particularly those that are fast moving.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Defence said it is a “proposal that needs to be developed and scoped out”. “The assessment would consider the demands that may be made of such interceptors and the military capabilities it would be expected to be able to supply, together with the associated technical specification and capability requirements.“This utility would have to be assessed against the significant investment of public funds, in respect of the initial investment and ongoing operational costs.”The Air Corps has previously used both the De Havilland Vampire, a British jet fighter, and the French-designed Fouga Magister jet trainer aircraft. It also continues to operate the Ministerial Air Transport Service jet aircraft however, the type of plane under consideration would represent a major upgrade in technology. Earlier this year Maj Gen Ralph James, who retired as head of the Air Corps in 2015, said the State would need about 16 jet fighters with three crews each to implement a full air-defence capability. CertificationHe said each pilot would need up to 400 hours behind the controls of the jet before earning fast-response certification. A jet programme of this kind would likely cost well in excess of €1 billion.Any such cost would impact the decision-making process – particularly given the cost to the State of the Covid-19 crisis. However, the question of airspace security is not academic. Last March, a number of Russian Tupolev TU-95 “Bear” bombers, also used as long-range maritime patrol planes, entered Irish airspace. In response, six Royal Air Force Typhoons were scrambled from bases in Scotland and England and headed towards counties Derry and Donegal to intercept, forcing them to alter course. Quick-reaction aircraft from Nato allies Norway and France also took part in the response.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290928.1593364646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kilkenny priest eager to get back among his flock","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Fr Liam Cashin at St Brendan’s church in Hugginstown, Co Kilkenny. Photograph:  Patrick BrowneFor months 71-year-old Fr Liam Cashin has said Mass in a small room in the parish house in Hugginstown in Co Kilkenny. From today he is eager to get back amongst his flock, officially.The cocooning months were hard. “For those first three or four weeks you’d only be allowed out around the garden. It was crap,” he laughs. Once he was able, he moved out.Once he held a Mass in the parish church for a parishioner facing a major operation in Dublin. “He asked me to pray for him. The man is now recovering well back in the parish. I had no inhibitions about it. I had masks in the car, rubber gloves, visors, sanitiser I knew if I got a call anytime, if someone needed a help, I was going, and I would deal with the consequences afterwards. Hugginstown has been spared a Covid-19 loss: “We had a death about a week or two before the virus struck, and the next death we had was only last weekend.”However, he lost a close cousin, Fr Jim Cashin, two weeks ago. “ I was with him in Kieran’s, we grew up together. He was in Thomastown and I was in Inistioge – there was just a valley between us.”Simple things helped – household chores, the “very green views of Barnadown” out the back of his house, along with regular deliveries of parishioners’ freshly-baked brown bread.People even called out to find out how he was doing for money.: “They were offering to pay money directly into the parish account. Even thinking in that line was amazing, I thought.”Others reached out too, including a message from a Jehovah’s Witness man. “What’s in it is private. He wished me well in it. It was a nice thing to get, of course it was.” Another religious group dropped in a lockdown mental health survey. “How we coped, that sort of thing. There was a question at the end of it: ‘Was there anything positive that you could say about it’. I thought for a while before I answered it. Then I put down that it was the first time in my life that I wasn’t dictated to by a diary or a watch.” Different rulesIf the virus returns he believes different rules will have to be applied to country and smaller churches. “We were treated the same as city churches. We’d have no problem social distancing. The most that’d be at our daily Masses would be seven or eight. We could have had that all along. If I was allowed to bring six people into the house here for a gathering, there’s no reason why I couldn’t have had six people in the church.”If the virus does come back in force Hugginstown could go back to using the parish’s now unroofed late 17th century church. “It is normally used for graveyard Masses every July, but it may see other uses. I could say Mass on the steps, and people could even listen from inside the grounds or from their cars. “I see no problem in doing that. We have a loudspeaker. On a nice Sunday morning if the sun is shining, there’d be nothing better.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290768.1593350738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new department of children to be responsible for direct provision","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters outside Leinster House in May call for the end of direct provision. Photograph: Nick BradshawResponsibility for the Direct Provision system, which will be abolished by the end of the Government’s term, will transfer from the Department of Justice to the recast Department of Children.Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration Roderic O’Gorman of the Green Party will now take responsibility for the system.It had previously been assumed that Direct Provision would remain within the auspices of the Department of Justice but Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, the Minister for Climate Action, Communication Networks and Transport, said it will be transferred.The abolition of the Direct Provision system was one of the key goals of the Greens during the coalition negotiations and Mr O’Gorman, who was previously his party’s justice spokesman, is credited with pushing the issue.The Programme for Government commits the new Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Green Party coalition to “ending the Direct Provision system and will replace it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not for profit approach”.The change will be made over the lifetime of the next Government and a white paper on the way forward for the international protection process will be drawn up by the end of the year. It will be informed by the current review into the system being carried out by Catherine Day.Speaking on RTÉ’s Week in Politics, Mr Ryan said it will take the lifetime of the next Government to fulfil the pledge to abolish the system, and that will be a matter for Mr O’Gorman’s department.“The justice department was actually a huge department, probably too big for any one minister,” Mr Ryan said. “So I think it has actually made sense to split a variety of functions within that and yes, in this new Department of Children, Disabilities, Equality and Integration: that is where it will reside.“It will be challenging. It will be up to Roderic O’Gorman as the minister responsible to manage the change.“He’s going to have a challenging job as every member of Cabinet is. That is one of the benefits of a Programme for Government is that this has been agreed. There is common purpose in this so it is a matter now of doing it. It will take time. It will take the full time of the Government.”Mr Ryan said Irish people themselves “agree that the current system affects people’s mental health, “restricts their ability to integrate into this country if they are here to stay”. He also said the decision making around those seeking international protection will be speeded up.“That all actually makes sense. I think there is broad agreement around it in the political system. It will not be easy to make the change but we are going to start and be consistent and steady and show leadership in doing that.”The three parties also agreed a number of short term measures for Direct Provision system, such as extra resources to help speed up the application process and reducing the time asylum seekers must be in the country to be eligible to work from nine months to six months.There will also be greater access to driver’s licences to asylum seekers, better training for management in Direct Provision centres, improved mental health services and better vulnerability assessments for those in the system.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290680.1593365329!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nine women among taoiseach s 11 appointees to seanad","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTraveller rights activist Eileen Flynn is one of Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s 11 appointments to the Seanad.  Photograph: Nick BradshawTraveller rights activist Eileen Flynn is one of Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s 11 appointments to the Seanad – the only non-party figure among the nominations.Ms Flynn, from Ballyfermot in Dublin, ran unsuccessfully in this year’s Seanad elections. She grew up on the Labre Park Traveller housing site. Since 2018, she has lived in Donegal, having married a local “settled” man, Liam White. The Fianna Fáil choices are unsuccessful Dáil candidates, former Clare TD Timmy Dooley former senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee and Dublin councillor Mary Fitzpatrick. Louth councillor Erin McGreehan also wins a nomination. Fianna Fáil currently has no Dáil seat in Louth and will be hoping that Ms McGreehan can use the Seanad as a platform to become a TD.Fine Gael has chosen Emer Currie, who was Tánaiste Leo Varadkar’s Dublin West running mate last time former minister for social protection Regina Doherty, who lost her seat in Meath East Galway councillor Aisling Dolan, who ran in the general election in Roscommon-Galway and South Dublin councillor Mary Seery-Kearney. For the Green Party, Kildare councillor Vincent P Martin has also been appointed. Mr Martin, a senior counsel, is a brother of Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin. He ran in Kildare North at the last general election and will hope to win a seat there next time. Clare councillor Róisín Garvey, who is seen as loyal to Eamon Ryan, has been chosen, too. She ran for the Greens at the last election. LegislationThe appointments mean that the Seanad is now fully constituted and can pass required legislation. including the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act, that had been held up for months.The Seanad, which meets today, also needs to pass legislation proposed by the last government to assist businesses through the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis.Speaking on Sunday, Ms Flynn said her nomination was “phenomenal”, adding that she wanted to work for all marginalised groups, but would never presume that she could be their voice.“I can’t speak for black people because I am not black,” she said. “‘Nothing about me, without me’ is something I have always said . . . But I’d like to work with and bring people into the Seanad and let people speak for themselves.”The number of women chosen is “positive, said the director of the National Women’s Council, Orla O’Connor, especially since just 22.5 per cent of TDs were women and 30.6 per cent of elected senators were women. “And of course we are absolutely delighted by the nomination of Eileen Flynn, who has been such a strong, important activist on issues that affect women predominantly – like housing, poverty and disadvantage.“Eileen will be an important voice on ersity. But we are disappointed that there remains no woman of colour in the Oireachtas at a time when we know racism is so present throughout society.”Human rights commissioner and founder of Akidwa – the migrant women’s network – Salome Mbuga said she was “disappointed an opportunity to make the Seanad more erse, has been missed.The lack of a Northern Ireland-based candidate breaks with decades of practice, too, though Cllr Currie is a daughter of former Fine Gael and SDLP politicians, Austin Currie.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fail lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent re-organising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016 Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fail’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fail negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fail spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fail out of government. The intense five-weeks campaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011.As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working Minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB accommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fail’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of state for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Leo Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio taoiseach Enda Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Eamon Ryan and deputy leader Catherine Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fail, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290938.1593365355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new coalition faces criticism over lack of regional balance in senior cabinet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe new Coalition has faced a barrage of criticism over the lack of regional balance in its senior Cabinet with no senior Minister from West, the North West or the South East. Photograph: MaxwellsThe new Coalition has faced a barrage of criticism over the lack of regional balance in its senior Cabinet with no senior Minister from West, the North West or the South East.Ministers were yesterday forced to defend and explain a Cabinet with 12 members from Dublin, the East Coast and Cork. There is no senior Minister from Connacht.Fianna Fáil TDs, in particular, expressed surprise at the omission of the party’s deputy leader, Mayo TD Dara Calleary, from the senior Cabinet. He has been appointed the Government chief whip, a ‘super junior’ role but was not one of the five senior Ministers appointed by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.MapThe Independent Deputy for Galway-Roscommon Michael Fitzmaurice held up a map of Ireland during the sitting of the Dáil on Saturday with counties on the western seaboard coloured red. Challenging the Taoiseach, he said:“I am baffled when you look at this map in the (red) area, you see there is not one senior minister from the top of Donegal to the bottom of Limerick,” he siad.“I am baffled that the West of Ireland will not have a senior minister. I am throwing down the gauntlet to you. It is your job to have equality in all parts of the country.“There are 1.2 million people there, the same as in the city of Dublin where you have six senior ministers,” he added.All three senior Green Ministers are based in Dublin constituencies. Its leader, Eamon Ryan, said it was difficult to get geographical spread when there were three different parties.“I think each leader was cognisant of getting gender balance and regional balance,” he said.He and several other Ministers made the argument that the three “super junior” Ministers were equal members of the Cabinet. They are: Mr Calleary Hildegarde Naughton (Galway West) and Senator Pippa Hackett, who is based in Offaly.“Every one in Cabinet has a real role. You do not look at the 15 (senior ministers). It is one cabinet and one group around the table who make collective decisions. Not having a vote is not the significant thing because Cabinets do not vote, they agree by consensus.”‘Good geographical spread’Minister for Social Protection and Rural Affairs Heather Humphreys argued there was a “good geographical spread”. “There has been a lot of talk about no senior minister on the western seaboard but the fact is that two senior people from the west will sit at the Cabinet table,” she said.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly argued that every Minister was a national minister and praised Mr Calleary’s competence, saying he and Ms Naughton would represent Mayo and Galway.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the geographical spread was problematic. She said that “neither geography nor gender trump competence but it’s not as if all the talent exists in Dublin, Cork and the East coast,” she said.There was a substantial reaction on social media in relation to the regional distribution of senior ministers, with ided views between those who contended the West had been forgotten, and those who argue that the home base of a politician should play no part in considering their merits for higher office."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290727.1593340672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sweeping changes as new cabinet unveiled","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre.

Some may be named Minsters of State next week.Announcing the names of the new Cabinet members in the Dáil on Saturday evening the Taoiseach, who earlier accepted his seal of office from President Michael D Higgins, also said Paul Gallagher would be the new attorney general.“In the coming week I will propose further deputies to serve as Ministers of State and outline a series of special responsibilities to be assigned to them. These will be focused on delivering specific priorities,” he said.The new Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party Cabinet was approved in the Dáil by 91 votes to 66 with one abstention, two fewer than supported the appointment of Mr \u0026nbspMartin as Taoiseach.Some TDs\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspcriticised the failure to appoint more Ministers from the western seaboard.

Photograph: Callaghan O’HareThe New York TimesFive US states hit record daily highs for coronavirus cases on Saturday, and American vice president Mike Pence cancelled planned campaign events in hard-hit areas.The number of confirmed US cases of the virus rose to more than 2.5 million on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally. More than 125,000 Americans have died of Covid-19, the highest known death toll of any country in the world.Florida on Saturday morning reported 9,585 new infections in the last 24 hours, a record for a second day, while Arizona recorded 3,591 new cases, matching its prior record on Tuesday.Mr Pence cancelled planned events to campaign for president Donald Trump’s re-election next week in Florida and Arizona out of “an abundance of caution,” campaign officials told Reuters.Meanwhile, Nevada on Saturday disclosed 1,099 new cases, double its previous record, while South Carolina and Georgia reported 1,604 and 1,990 new infections, respectively, also marking new daily highs.The surge in cases has been most pronounced in a handful of southern and western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively, serving as a warning to the potentially illusory nature of any perceived progress in controlling the virus.For the third consecutive day, new US cases rose by more than 40,000 on Saturday. The United States has now seen 2.52 million cases since the pandemic began, according to the Reuters tally.The worsening contagion in some parts of the United States has created a split-screen effect, with New York and its neighbouring Northeastern states, which were hit hardest initially, reporting declining cases and forging ahead with reopening plans.Kami Kim, director of the Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine at the University of South Florida, said her state’s leaders claimed victory too soon after lockdowns were lifted starting in early May, while giving off conflicting messages on face coverings by not wearing masks themselves.“It was just complete denial by a huge swath of the politicians,” she said, predicting that the state may need to shut down again. “Unfortunately, our community still isn’t taking it very seriously. People aren’t wearing masks.”Washington state governor Jay Inslee said on Saturday that his state would pause moving into the next stages of opening its economy as cases there rise.In Texas, a state that was on the vanguard of letting people get back to work, Texas governor Greg Abbott ordered bars across the state to close and required restaurants to limit indoor seating, acknowledging that in hindsight he had opened bars too soon.Despite skyrocketing case numbers, both Mr Abbott and Florida governor Ron DeSantis have not bowed to pressure to issue statewide mandates on wearing masks, opting to leave that decision to local municipalities. Both Mr Abbott and Mr DeSantis are Republican. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290857.1593357391!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how the world missed the silent spread of the coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Camilla Rothe and her team prepare for a shift at Munich University Hospital earlier this month. Photograph: Laetitia VanconNew York TimesDr Camilla Rothe was about to leave for dinner when the government laboratory called with the surprising test result. Positive. It was January 27th. She had just discovered Germany’s first case of the new coronavirus.But the diagnosis made no sense. Her patient, a businessman from a nearby auto parts company, could have been infected by only one person: a colleague visiting from China. And that colleague should not have been contagious. The visitor had seemed perfectly healthy during her stay in Germany. No coughing or sneezing, no signs of fatigue or fever during two days of long meetings.She told colleagues that she had started feeling ill after the flight back to China. Days later, she tested positive for the coronavirus.Scientists at the time believed that only people with symptoms could spread the coronavirus. They assumed it acted like its genetic cousin, Sars. “People who know much more about coronaviruses than I do were absolutely sure,” recalled Rothe, an infectious disease specialist at Munich University Hospital.But if the experts were wrong – if the virus could spread from seemingly healthy carriers or people who had not yet developed symptoms – the ramifications were potentially catastrophic. Public awareness campaigns, airport screening and stay-home-if-you’re sick policies might not stop it.More aggressive measures might be required: ordering healthy people to wear masks, for instance, or restricting international travel.Rothe and her colleagues were among the first to warn the world. But even as evidence accumulated from other scientists, leading health officials expressed unwavering confidence that symptomless spreading was not important. In the days and weeks to come, politicians, public health officials and rival academics disparaged or ignored the Munich team.Some actively worked to undermine the warnings at a crucial moment, as the disease was spreading unnoticed in French churches, Italian football stadiums and Austrian ski bars. A cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, would become a deadly harbinger of symptomless spreading.Semantic debateInterviews with doctors and public health officials in more than a dozen countries show that for two crucial months – and in the face of mounting genetic evidence – Western health officials and political leaders played down or denied the risk of symptomless spreading.Leading health agencies including the World Health Organisation and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control provided contradictory and sometimes misleading advice. A crucial public health discussion devolved into a semantic debate over what to call infected people without clear symptoms.The two-month delay was a product of faulty scientific assumptions, academic rivalries and, perhaps most important, a reluctance to accept that containing the virus would take drastic measures. The resistance to emerging evidence was one part of the world’s sluggish response to the virus.It is impossible to calculate the human toll of that delay, but models suggest that earlier, aggressive action might have saved tens of thousands of lives. Countries such as Singapore and Australia, which used testing and contact tracing and moved swiftly to quarantine seemingly healthy travellers, fared far better than those that did not.It is now widely accepted that seemingly healthy people can spread the virus, though uncertainty remains over how much they have contributed to the pandemic. Although estimates vary, models using data from Hong Kong, Singapore and China suggest 30 per cent to 60 per cent of spreading occurs when people have no symptoms.“This was, I think, a very simple truth,” Rothe said. “I was surprised that it would cause such a storm. I can’t explain it.”Even now, with more than nine million cases around the world and a death toll approaching 500,000, Covid-19 remains an unsolved riddle. It is too soon to know whether the worst has passed or if a second global wave of infections is about to crash down. But it is clear that an array of countries, from secretive regimes to overconfident democracies, have fumbled their response, misjudged the virus and ignored their own emergency plans.It is also painfully clear that time was a critical commodity in curbing the virus – and that too much of it was wasted.Mild symptomsOn the night of Germany’s first positive test, the virus had seemed far away. Fewer than 100 fatalities had been reported worldwide. Italy, which would become Europe’s ground zero, would not record its first cases for another three days.A few reports out of China had already suggested the possibility of symptomless spreading. But nobody had proved it could happen. That night, Rothe tapped out an email to a few dozen doctors and public health officials. “Infections can actually be transmitted during the incubation period,” she wrote.Three more employees from the auto parts company, Webasto, tested positive the following day. Their symptoms were so mild that, normally, it’s likely that none would have been flagged for testing or would have thought to stay at home.Rothe decided she had to sound the alarm. Her boss, Dr Michael Hoelscher, dashed off an email to the New England Journal of Medicine. “We believe that this observation is of utmost importance,” he wrote.Editors responded immediately. How soon could they see the paper? The next morning, January 30th, public health officials interviewed the Chinese businesswoman by phone. Hospitalised in Shanghai, she explained that she had started feeling sick on the flight home. Looking back, maybe she had had some mild aches or fatigue, but she had chalked them up to a long day of travel.“From her perspective, she was not ill,” said Nadine Schian, a Webasto spokeswoman who was on the call. “She said, ‘okay, I felt tired. But I’ve been in Germany a lot of times before, and I always have jet lag’.”When the health officials described the call, Rothe and Hoelscher quickly finished and submitted their article. Rothe did not talk to the patient herself but said she relied on the health authority summary. Within hours, it was online. It was a modest clinical observation at a key time.Just days earlier, the World Health Organisation had said it needed more information about this very topic. What the authors did not know, however, was that in a suburb 20 minutes away, another group of doctors had also been rushing to publish a report. Neither knew what the other was working on, a seemingly small academic rift that would have global implications.Similar conclusionsThe second group was made up of officials with the Bavarian health authority and Germany’s national health agency, known as the Robert Koch Institute. Inside a suburban office, doctors unfurled mural paper and traced infection routes using coloured pens.Rothe had written that patients appeared to be contagious before the onset of any symptoms. The government team had written that patients appeared to be contagious before the onset of full symptoms – at a time when symptoms were so mild that people might not even recognise them.The Chinese woman, for example, had woken up in the middle of the night feeling jet-lagged. Wanting to be sharp for her meetings, she took a Chinese medicine called 999 – containing the equivalent of a Tylenol tablet – and went back to bed. Perhaps that had masked a mild fever? Perhaps her jet lag was actually fatigue? She had reached for a shawl during a meeting. Maybe that was a sign of chills?After two lengthy phone calls with the woman, doctors at the Robert Koch Institute were convinced that she had simply failed to recognise her symptoms. They wrote to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, casting doubt on Rothe’s findings.Editors there decided that the dispute amounted to hairsplitting. If it took a lengthy interview to identify symptoms, how could anyone be expected to do it in the real world? “The question was whether she had something consistent with Covid-19 or that anyone would have recognised at the time was Covid-19,” said Dr Eric Rubin, the journal’s editor. “The answer seemed to be no.”The journal did not publish the letter. But that would not be the end of it.That weekend, Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian health authority, called Hoelscher of the Munich clinic. “Look, the people in Berlin are very angry about your publication,” Zapf said, according to Hoelscher. He suggested changing the wording of Rothe’s report and replacing her name with those of members of the government task force, Hoelscher said. He refused.The health agency would not discuss the phone call. Until then, Hoelscher said, their report had seemed straightforward. Now it was clear: “Politically, this was a major, major issue.”‘Complete tsunami’On Monday, February 3rd, the journal Science published an article calling Rothe’s report “flawed”. Science reported that the Robert Koch Institute had written to the New England Journal to dispute her findings and correct an error. The Robert Koch Institute declined repeated interview requests over several weeks and did not answer written questions.Rothe’s report quickly became a symbol of rushed research. Scientists said she should have talked to the Chinese patient herself before publishing and that the omission had undermined her team’s work. On Twitter, she and her colleagues were disparaged by scientists and armchair experts alike.“It broke over us like a complete tsunami,” Hoelscher said. The controversy also overshadowed another crucial development out of Munich. The next morning, Dr Clemens-Martin Wendtner made a startling announcement. Wendtner was overseeing treatment of Munich’s Covid-19 patients – there were eight now – and had taken swabs from each.He discovered the virus in the nose and throat at much higher levels, and far earlier, than had been observed in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). That meant it probably could spread before people knew they were sick.But the Science story drowned that news out. If Rothe’s paper had implied that governments might need to do more against Covid-19, the pushback from the Robert Koch Institute was an implicit defence of the conventional thinking.Sweden’s public health agency declared that Rothe’s report had contained major errors. The agency’s website said, unequivocally, that “there is no evidence that people are infectious during the incubation period” – an assertion that would remain online in some form for months.French health officials, too, left no room for debate: “A person is contagious only when symptoms appear,” a government flyer read. “No symptoms  no risk of being contagious.”As Rothe and Hoelscher reeled from the criticism, Japanese doctors were preparing to board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A former passenger had tested positive for coronavirus. Yet on the ship, parties continued. The infected passenger had been off the ship for days, after all. And he hadn’t reported symptoms while on board.Semantic distinctionImmediately after Rothe’s report, the World Health Organisation had noted that patients might transmit the virus before showing symptoms. But the organisation also underscored a point that it continues to make: Patients with symptoms are the main drivers of the epidemic.Once the Science paper was published, however, the organisation waded directly into the debate on Rothe’s work. On Tuesday, February 4th, Dr Sylvie Briand, the agency’s chief of infectious disease preparedness, tweeted a link to the Science paper, calling Rothe’s report flawed.With that tweet, the WHO focused on a semantic distinction that would cloud discussion for months: Was the patient asymptomatic, meaning she would never show symptoms? Or presymptomatic, meaning she became sick later? Or, even more confusing, oligo-symptomatic, meaning that she had symptoms so mild that she didn’t recognise them?To some doctors, the focus on these arcane distinctions felt like whistling in the graveyard. A person who feels healthy has no way to know that she is carrying a virus or is about to become sick. Airport temperature checks will not catch these people. Neither will asking them about their symptoms nor telling them to stay home when they feel ill.The WHO later said that the tweet had not been intended as a criticism.One group paid little attention to this brewing debate: the Munich-area doctors working to contain the cluster at the auto parts company. They spoke daily with potentially sick people, monitoring their symptoms and tracking their contacts.“All you need is a pair of eyes,” she said. “You don’t need rocket-science virology.” But she remained confident. “We will be proven right,” she told Hoelscher.That night, Rothe received an email from Dr Michael Libman, an infectious disease specialist in Montreal. He thought that criticism of the paper amounted to semantics. Her paper had convinced him of something: “The disease will most likely eventually spread around the world.”Startling callOn February 4th, Britain’s emergency scientific committee met and, while its experts did not rule out the possibility of symptomless transmission, nobody put much stock in Rothe’s paper.“It was very much a hearsay study,” said Wendy Barclay, a virologist and member of the committee, known as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. “In the absence of real robust epidemiology and tracing, it isn’t obvious until you see the data.”The data would soon arrive, and from an unexpected source. Böhmer, from the Bavarian health team, received a startling phone call in the second week of February.Virologists had discovered a subtle genetic mutation in the infections of two patients from the Munich cluster. They had crossed paths for the briefest of moments, one passing a saltshaker to the other in the company cafeteria, when neither had symptoms. Their shared mutation made it clear that one had infected the other.Böhmer had been sceptical of symptomless spreading. But now there was no doubt: “It can only be explained with presymptomatic transmission,” Böhmer said. Now it was Böhmer who sounded the alarm. She said she promptly shared the finding, and its significance, with the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Neither organisation included the discovery in its regular reports.A week after receiving Böhmer’s information, European health officials were still declaring, “We are still unsure whether mild or asymptomatic cases can transmit the virus.” There was no mention of the genetic evidence. WHO officials said the genetic discovery informed their thinking, but they made no announcement of it.European health officials said the German information was one early piece of an emerging picture that they were still piecing together. The doctors in Munich were increasingly frustrated and confused by the WHO. First, the group wrongly credited the Chinese government with alerting German authorities to the first infection. Government officials and doctors said the auto parts company itself sounded the alarm.Then, the WHO’s emergency director, Dr Michael Ryan, said on February 27th that the significance of symptomless spreading was becoming a myth. And Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the organisation’s technical lead on the coronavirus response, suggested it was nothing to worry about.“It’s rare but possible,” she said. “It’s very rare.” The agency still maintains that people who cough or sneeze are more contagious than people who don’t. But there is no scientific consensus on how significant this difference is or how it affects the spread of virus.And so, with evidence mounting, the Munich team could not understand how the WHO could be so sure that symptomless spreading was insignificant. “At this point, for us it was clear,” said Wendtner, the senior doctor overseeing treatment of the Covid-19 patients. “This was a misleading statement by the WHO.”Silent spreadersThe Munich cluster was not the only warning. Chinese health authorities had explicitly cautioned that patients were contagious before showing symptoms. A Japanese bus driver was infected while transporting seemingly healthy tourists from Wuhan, China. And by the middle of February, 355 people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship had tested positive. About one-third of the infected passengers and staff had no symptoms.Public health officials saw danger in promoting the risk of silent spreaders. If quarantining sick people and tracing their contacts could not reliably contain the disease, governments might abandon those efforts altogether.In Sweden and Britain, for example, discussion swirled about enduring the epidemic until the population obtained “herd immunity”. Public health officials worried that might lead to overwhelmed hospitals and needless deaths. Plus, preventing silent spreading required aggressive, widespread testing that was then impossible for most countries.“It’s not like we had some easy alternative,” said Libman, the Canadian doctor. “The message was basically, ‘If this is true, we’re in trouble’.”European health officials said they were reluctant to acknowledge silent spreading because the evidence was trickling in and the consequences of a false alarm would have been severe. “These reports are seen everywhere, all over the world,” said Dr Josep Jansa, a senior European Union health official. “Whatever we put out, there’s no way back.”Looking back, health officials should have said that, yes, symptomless spreading was happening and they did not understand how prevalent it was, said Dr Agoritsa Baka, a senior EU doctor. But doing that, she said, would have amounted to an implicit warning to countries: What you’re doing might not be enough.While public health officials hesitated, some doctors acted. At a conference in Seattle in mid-February, Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University professor, said his research suggested Covid-19’s rapid spread could be explained only if there were infectious patients with unremarkable symptoms or no symptoms at all.In the audience that day was Steven Chu, the Nobel-winning physicist and former US energy secretary. “If left to its own devices, this disease will spread through the whole population,” he remembers Shaman warning.Afterwards, Chu began insisting that healthy colleagues at his Stanford University laboratory wear masks. Doctors in Cambridge, England, concluded that asymptomatic transmission was a big source of infection and advised local health workers and patients to wear masks well before the British government acknowledged the risk of silent spreaders.Spreading the diseaseUS authorities, faced with a shortage, actively discouraged the public from buying masks. “Seriously people ? STOP BUYING MASKS!”, surgeon general Jerome Adams tweeted February 29th.By early March, while the WHO continued pressing the case that symptom-free transmission was rare, science was breaking in the other direction. Researchers in Hong Kong estimated that 44 per cent of Covid-19 transmission occurred before symptoms began, an estimate that was in line with a British study that put that number as high as 50 per cent.The Hong Kong study concluded that people became infectious about two days before their illness emerged, with a peak on their first day of symptoms. By the time patients felt the first headache or scratch in the throat, they might have been spreading the disease for days.In Belgium, doctors saw that maths in action as Covid-19 tore through nursing homes, killing nearly 5,000 people. “We thought that by monitoring symptoms and asking sick people to stay at home, we would be able to manage the spread,” said Steven Van Gucht, head of Belgium’s Covid-19 scientific committee. “It came in through people with hardly any symptoms.”More than 700 people aboard the Diamond Princess were sickened. Fourteen died. Researchers estimate that most of the infection occurred early on, while seemingly healthy passengers socialised and partied. Government scientists in Britain concluded in late April that 5 per cent to 6 per cent of symptomless health care workers were infected and might have been spreading the virus.In Munich, Hoelscher has asked himself many times whether things would have been different if world leaders had taken the issue seriously earlier. He compared their response to a rabbit stumbling upon a poisonous snake. “We were watching that snake and were somehow paralysed,” he said.As the research coalesced in March, European health officials were convinced. “Okay, this is really a big issue,” Baka recalled thinking. “It plays a big role in the transmission.”By the end of the month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was rethinking its policy on masks. It concluded that up to 25 per cent of patients might have no symptoms. Since then, the CDC, governments around the world and, finally, the WHO have recommended that people wear masks in public.Still, the WHO is sending confusing signals. Earlier this month, Van Kerkhove, the technical lead, repeated that transmission from asymptomatic patients was “very rare”. After an outcry from doctors, the agency said there had been a misunderstanding.“In all honesty, we don’t have a clear picture on this yet,” Van Kerkhove said. She said she had been referring to a few studies showing limited transmission from asymptomatic patients.Contact tracingRecent internet ads confused the matter even more. A Google search in mid-June for studies on asymptomatic transmission returned a WHO advertisement titled “People With No Symptoms – Rarely Spread Coronavirus. ”Clicking on the link, however, offered a much more nuanced picture: “Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus. It is not yet known how often it happens.” After the New York Times asked about those discrepancies, the organisation removed the advertisements.Back in Munich, there is little doubt left. Böhmer, the Bavarian government doctor, published a study in the Lancet last month that relied on extensive interviews and genetic information to methodically track every case in the cluster. In the months after Rothe swabbed her first patient, 16 infected people were identified and caught early. All survived.Aggressive testing and flawless contact tracing contained the spread. Böhmer’s study found “substantial” transmission from people with no symptoms or exceptionally mild, nonspecific symptoms.

The country has had the biggest percentage drop in weekly cases of 45 countries, according to one analysis, and this week announced a major relaxation of its “intelligent” lockdown.Sex workers, often unable to access government support because of how they are registered, have been keen to restart work. Unions had even sent the government their own protocol of measures from “don’t shake hands” to banning positions in the client’s “moist breath zone”.In the red light district in Amsterdam this weekend, window brothels are being spruced up ready for work. The Red Light United union expects sex workers to wear gloves and avoid oral sex, and André van Dorst, director of the VER union for relaxation businesses, told The Sunday  safety would come first: “There are already public health institute hygiene protocols, which were no problem to introduce in the industry and are in general complied with. The same thing will happen with corona because nobody trusts this virus – everyone is in safety mode.”The Netherlands was one of the earlier countries in Europe to show mass infections, and on March 16 started what Rutte called an intelligent lockdown: schools, bars, restaurants, gyms and contact professions were shut and people asked to keep a distance and work from home. Later, the government imposed a limit of three adults meeting and €390 personal fines, but actually gave out very few personal or business fines.Rutte has always appealed to people’s common sense rather than taking a top-down approach. “From the beginning, we have tried to talk adult to adult to tell Dutch society of the facts and what the world’s best virologists are advising,” he said this week.However, faced with an economic contraction of 6 per cent, the Dutch experts now recommend broad-scale reopening, with limits especially inside and 1.5m distancing (or facemasks). Loes Hartman, a spokeswoman for the RIVM, said they had now also weighed up the \u0027social costs\u0027 of lockdown: “This means the extent to which children will be behind if schools are closed, economic damage, psychological impacts and a broad spectrum of effects that are often negative.”Not everything has gone right. There has been some criticism that many corona deaths went uncounted due to limited testing before June, and officially the country of 17 million has the 15th highest number of deaths internationally. Economist Mathijs Bouman told The : “Economically, we have managed it quite well but of course we have a rather high death rate, especially in nursing homes, and a lot of that was probably preventable. Our laid-back approach, especially in testing, was clearly not the right one so we lost the game in the first couple of weeks.“We are going to the boundaries of what’s possible at the moment – but since one third of our money is earned abroad we are still a cork floating on a wild international sea.”The sex trade could be at the coalface of whether the bold Dutch approach will provoke a second wave of infection – for those that did, indeed, stop.Sex work activist and webcam and pornography performer Yvette Luhrs told NOS Radio 1 that the reopening was a relief, tinged with bitterness. “It took too long for a colleague who ended it all earlier this week,” she said, “but also for people who have been evicted from their homes, and for the sex workers who just had to carry on working and were at risk.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"algae coated seal prompts animal rights controversy santander","story":"Animal rights activists in Spain have called for the closure of a council-run zoo after disturbing images of a dead sea lion half-covered by a plastic bag and a grey seal completely covered with algae drew heated criticism on social media.They say the Santander visitor attraction is a “throwback” to the bad old days of unhappy animals in small concrete pens.After thousands of people commented on the pictures of bored-looking penguins and inert seals in tiny, shallow pools at the mini-zoo on Santander’s Magdalena peninsula, local Left-wing opposition parties unsuccessfully tabled a motion before the city council demanding the site be closed.“Those pictures convey an image of inconceivable and disgraceful treatment of animals when we see things like the sea lion pen with no water,” said Socialist Party councillor Daniel Fernández.“This would be unacceptable anywhere in the world, but it is even more surprising in a city that wants to position itself as a tourist attraction”, Mr Fernández added.More than 25,000 people have signed an online petition on Change.org to close the Magdalena mini-zoo, built in the 1980s, and animal rights group AnimaNaturalis says more than 6,000 have signed its letter of protest to Santander council.Santander Mayor Gema Igual denied that there was any mistreatment of the animals at the mini-zoo, however, and the motion was defeated at last week’s council meeting.Ms Igual, of the conservative Popular Party, said images of a listless grey seal had been taken out of context.“That photo was of a sleeping animal, and the dead sea lion was not in a place people could see it because it was known to be ill.”Aïda Gascón, leader of AnimaNaturalis in Spain, said that the seal covered in green algae “seems to be letting itself die”.Opposition councillors said they could not understand why the seals’ pools were so stagnant and algae-filled, with seawater from the Atlantic available just metres from the zoo.  Having met with local authorities and inspected the zoo, Ms Gascón said she believed it should be closed gradually, with immediate action taken to improve the welfare of the existing animals. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beach goers new brexiteers remainer snobs","story":"On Wednesday night there was a riot at the end of my street and I slept right through it what I supposed to be a dozen youngsters having some wholesome fun as I drifted heedlessly into the arms of Morpheus was described in the tabloids the next day as “pure mayhem”.An eyewitness told our local paper the Argus: “There were ten police cars and about two thousand kids were walking around shouting at police like football chants – it was a stand-off.” Predictably “litter was left scattered across the grass, with alcohol bottles, juice cartons, a football and clothing being just some of the items left behind.” (Lady Bracknell voice: ‘A football?’)I couldn’t get myself into a state about it, though some locals were fuming that such antics should take place within sight of the Queen Victoria statue at the bottom of a street a friend once only half-mockingly referred to as “the Champs Elysee of Hove”. Why couldn’t they have desecrated dirty Brighton just a few yards down the road, Hovians tutted, which as Keith Waterhouse memorably wrote “always looks as if it’s helping the police with their enquiries” anyway.Apparently for many of the youngsters it would have been their prom night after completing their GCSEs. I felt slightly complicit, remembering what I wrote in this newspaper last month: “If I was in charge, I’d let teenagers out first so they could have a lovely weekend when the streets belong to them, meeting up in parks and on beaches.”If they were brandishing copies of the Sunday  at the rozzers, surely my status as The Voice Of Youth would at last be restored in my sixtieth year?But by the time I ventured out the following noon, the Lawns were pristine, because that’s what a seaside town is geared up to do – get messy and smarten itself up again. It’s how the hospitality trade makes the money which sees us through each long cold winter.The beach too was gorgeous, with water so clean that a fisher caught a bream from a groyne while my friend was bitten by a luscious-looking crab while paddling. Here were lots of jolly families taking their ease at sensible distances and only my husband and myself letting the tone down as we chugged cocktails from cans.It made us smug to read of genteel Bournemouth and the Dante’s Inferno-esque descriptions which were filtering out like bulletins from a war zone, with police declaring the beach itself “a major incident” as an allegedly half a million degenerates descended to defile the cowering watering hole. Gridlock, illegal parking, anti-social behaviour, overnight camping and overflowing bins were just a few of the nightmarish aspects of this degenerate Dorset re-imagined by Hieronymus Bosch.Of course we won’t be sniggering if there’s another spike due to our fun in the sun – but let’s try a bit of perspective here.As William Goldman once said of Hollywood, “No one knows anything”. We can’t keep the youth caged up indefinitely so that we who’ve already had our fun can sleep safe in our blameless beds. Every festival is cancelled and all music is silenced everywhere this summer seaside towns are by far the best places to let off steam.The sea definitely makes people more pleasant. It’s all well and good seaside councils from Blackpool to Cornwall begging people not to rock up and make merry, but the staff in the beachfront bars tell a different story.And there’s already an unpleasant aspect to the reporting of the people determined to enjoy a few hours in the sun after three months of being shut up in a surreal half-world.These are the people who voted for Brexit, you can hear the self-styled great and the good sniff every Lady Muck and namby-pamby is having a field day with this new stick to bash the “gammons” with. It’s a new angle on what I named The Big Sulk (“La Grande Boude”) of the populist-hating Establishment.No one is saying that seaside councils can’t be practical put up roadblocks if you must, work the one-in one-out system with cars as shops do with customers.

As a teenager, Pugh wore tight braids, which originate from African culture.“She began to explain to me what cultural appropriation was, the history and heartbreak over how when black girls do it they’re mocked and judged, but when white girls do it, it’s only then perceived as cool,” Pugh wrote to her 1.5million followers.She also explained that at the time, she was defensive about the issue, which she said she now recognises as an indicator of her own “white fragility”.In her statement she also revealed that one of her fans criticised her on Instagram for appropriating Rastafarian culture as a 17-year-old.“At the time I honestly did not think that I was doing anything wrong,” she said. “Growing up as white and privileged allowed me to get that far and not know.”Her comments come at a time when businesses are being rebranded and historic monuments and statues are being reconsidered in light of their controversial links to the colonial past.Pugh also explained how she befriended a shop owner when she was eight-years-old who taught her how to apply henna.“There wasn’t a summer where I didn’t henna my hands, feet, my family’s hands and feet, my friends – I was obsessed,” she wrote.However she went on to write that in 2017, when henna and bindis “became a trend” she was annoyed that “a culture was being abused for profit”.“And here’s the problem. I wasn’t actually being respectful in how I was using it. I wore this culture on my terms only, to parties, at dinner. I too was disrespecting the beauty of the religion that had been taught to me those years ago.”Pugh ended her statement with another apology: “I cannot dismiss the actions I bought into years ago, but I believe that we who were blind to such things must acknowledge them and recognise them as our faults, our ignorance and our white privilege and I apologise profusely that it took this long.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"orwellian double think woke elite blinds ridiculousness","story":"With the Archbishop of Canterbury urging ecclesiastical iconoclasm with a vim not seen since the days of Thomas Cranmer, one could almost think the culture war’s excesses had lost their ability to shock. Yet last week produced two examples so blatant, so deranged and so shameless as to astonish even the most cynical observer.First, Cambridge University’s defence of Dr Priyamvada Gopal, a lecturer in postcolonial literature who sparked a (not unreasonable) public backlash after tweeting that “White lives don’t matter. As white lives”. Amid calls for her dismissal, Cambridge released a supportive message, apparently condemning “cancel culture” in all its forms:“The university defends the right of its academics to express their own lawful opinions which others might find controversial and deplores in the strongest terms abuse and personal attacks”.Noble sentiments indeed, but it also happens to be a lie – and one so barefaced that it would almost be funny if it weren’t so tragic.Under a “progressive” new vice chancellor, Cambridge has led the way in appeasing the outrage mob. It has singularly failed to defend conservative academics such as the sociologist Noah Carl – summarily dismissed after an open letter from faculty members accused him of racism. It took university authorities just 48 hours to rescind Jordan Peterson’s visiting fellowship, while the students’ union claimed his “work and views” were “not representative of the student body”. Curiouser and curiouser. In claiming to value free speech (but only for certain opinions) Cambridge is guilty both of double standards, and double-think.Similar sleight of mind can be seen in the tragicomical conduct of Booker Prize organisers, who sacked their long-time patroness Baroness Nicholson as honorary vice-president for the “crimes” of voting against gay marriage in 2013, believing in biological sex and “misgendering” someone on Twitter. An equally Orwellian statement followed:“We deplore racism, homophobia and transphobia, and do not discriminate on any grounds. Literature is open, plural and questioning. We believe every author’s work should be approached by readers in the same spirit.”No satire could match this delicious declaration of support for openness and plurality of opinion, while sacking someone people disagreed with. Like adults who wear Crocs in public, they seem to have forgotten that we can see them.The double-think is as unsurprising as it is flagrant. Once-niche “critical theory” has infiltrated contemporary discourse, with its rejection of logic, reason and objective reality. And revolutionaries always become what they claim to abhor, like the French radicals who repressed formal religion and ended up worshipping an amorphous Cult of Reason, and replaced the judiciary with “people’s courts”. Today, we are similarly discovering what atrocities may be committed under the guise of the Rights of Man.Dominating every major wing of cultural life, small wonder that the Left feels so comfortable in its exquisite hypocrisies. Influential appointments have the ring of a cosy, quasi-incestuous club, a conveyor belt of Left-wing opinion linking  editorships, heads of Oxbridge colleges, public health quangocrats and more. Readers may recall the popular game “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon”, in which film buffs challenge each other to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and the prolific Bacon. A colleague suggests a version for the quangocracy “Six Degrees of Shami Chakrabarti”.For how long can this state of affairs continue? Being obliged to parrot propaganda and declare the sky is pink to retain your livelihood is emotionally draining. Neither is it healthy for our institutions to be so consistently out of step with public opinion, overseen by a detached cultural elite that is only occasionally roused from its perch by a disobliging election or referendum result. Few of us wish to inhabit a monoculture, and the quality of artistic output is already suffering take the Booker Prize’s own deterioration in the literary landscape.Worst of all, it will destroy genuine progress. In liberal California, presumably to pave the way for “affirmative action” measures, the legislature has just voted to strike anti-discrimination commitments from its constitution – a development that should terrify all thinking people. Britain is never far behind America and already ours is a topsy-turvy world, in which bullies feign victimhood, discrimination masquerades as social justice and “feminist” activists use the mantle of progressivism to hound women with impunity.

The president\u0027s broad support - coupled with alleged vote-buying and ballot irregularities - is likely to be enough for a comfortable victory.A graduate of the city\u0027s most prestigious law school, Mr Putin made a career in the KGB but swiftly joined the office of the reformist St Petersburg mayor after the fall of the Soviet Union.The 67-year old leader was born in then Leningrad, less than a decade after the deadly siege of the city during the Second World War, and grew up in a rough-and-tumble neighbourhood in the former imperial capital that grew shabby and destitute by then.In the two decades under Mr Putin, the city of 5 million people got an expensive facelift, with boutique hotels, local designer shops and organic food cafes at former warehouses popping all over town.St Petersburg now boasts not only world-class art at the Hermitage museum but also contemporary art venues, sailboat tours and fine dining at glitzy restaurants dotting its iconic canals.But the lockdown that began in March threatens to wind back the clock in Russia’s second-largest city, famous for its spectacular palaces and the so-called White Nights in summer when the sun barely goes down.Hundreds of thousands of people reliant on the hospitality industry were largely left to their own devices in the absence of any significant government aid.Mr Konovalov, who witnessed the boom of Russia’s economy in the 2000s, has now lost faith after promises of help in the middle of the epidemic turned hollow.“I can’t stand all these lies: He used to say he wouldn’t run again, and now he’s canceling the (presidential) term limits,” the businessman said.On the city’s web of rivers and canals, typically thronged with boats, it is eerily empty this year at the height of the travel season.  Nikolai Predtechesnky, 33, who has been running a company which owns 120 boats and smaller yachts, said the lockdown and the lack of government aid has changed attitudes to Mr Putin to the worse.“My friends, my own grandmother, my acquaintances who work for the government… everyone is beginning to understand that this system is broken,” he said. “Society needs profound changes.”The amendment that resets the clock on term limits for the sitting president is one of a myriad of constitutional changes that is up to vote including a pledge to keep increasing state pension payouts and boost the protection of the environment and the Russian language.Many voting in this week’s nationwide vote are likely to be unaware that they would be essentially allowing Mr Putin to rule for life since state media and election officials have been touting the amendments promising better living standards but have largely stayed away from discussing Mr Putin’s potential rule for life.Mr Putin\u0027s current term expires in 2024, and analysts say the Russian leader of 20 years has become irritated by Kremlin insiders who started looking for a possible successor.Opposition activists have unearthed videos of Mr Putin’s remarks from as much as a decade ago when he vehemently pledged that he had no intention of breaking the law or re-writing the Constitution to suit his needs.“Putin would have been genuinely shocked if someone had shown to him back in 2000 what he would be up to this year,” said Ms Stanovaya at the Moscow Carnegie Center.“But people change, and 20 years is a long time. The closer he gets to the end (of his term), the scarier it is to leave.”Veteran political analyst Lilia Shevtsova who rang the alarm about the former KGB officer’s uncontrolled rise to power two decades ago now warns about the danger of letting Mr Putin stay in office as long as he pleases.“By cementing its authority today, the Kremlin is planting a bomb under the future,” she wrote in a blog. “The state is merging with the leader whose potential departure should evoke a threat of annihilation in people’s eyes.”The vote was postponed in view of the growing Covid-19 epidemic and is now scheduled to run for a week, ending on 1 July. Coronavirus has claimed nearly 9,000 lives and infected more than 600,000 people, according to official statistics, but critics fear the real numbers are far higher.The vote is going to be held under new, lax rules, criticised for leaving much room for rigging, analysts say.Reports of potential vote buying as well as numerous complaints from public servants and state firms’ employees about being coerced to vote in the middle of the ongoing epidemic materialised as soon as the vote began on Thursday when several journalists documented how easy it was for them to vote twice - in person and in electronic voting.An opinion poll conducted by Russia’s only independent pollster Levada Centre showed that 44 percent would support the amendments, and 32 percent would vote against. But many people are hesitant about going to polling stations, which would benefit Kremlin supporters.Boat owner Mr Predtechensky, a graduate of the St Petersburg law school like President Putin, has no illusion about his vote making a difference but he still intends to cast his ballot:“I’ll have to put on a mask, latex gloves, bring a sanitiser and some cognac to get over this monstrosity.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"regional lockdowns unenforceable could lead significant disorder","story":"“We believe that are several reasons why it would not be suitable for implementation in the UK and that it could a) undermine the consensus that has been built on the need for restrictive measures and b) lead to significant issues of disorder,” the experts wrote.“The measures as proposed would entail the use of state power in an unprecedented way that could be perceived as discriminatory. “A consensus has evolved in the UK over the last weeks concerning the need for restrictive measures which suggests that support for restrictive measures is contingent upon a sense of equality of sacrifice (i.e. we are all in together).

It\u0027s the sword\u0027s right of the conquest,” said AK party chairman Numan Kurtulmuş, referring to an ancient tradition where the largest temple in a city is turned into a mosque after it has been conquered. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/04/14/jay-z.jpg","title":"beyonce black is king trailer disney plus the lion king watch","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Visual album is described as ‘a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience’Disney Plus has announced a new film from Beyoncé, which was influenced in part by her work on Disney’s reboot of The Lion King.

The lost item posed no risk to the astronauts, spacewalk or the station, Nasa said.Nasa renaming headquarters in honour of first black female engineerSpacewalking astronauts wear a wrist mirror on each sleeve to get better views while working. The mirror is just 5 inches by 3 inches, and together with its band has a mass of barely one-tenth of a pound.Cassidy and Bob Behnken, who followed him out without mishap, were conducting the first of at least four spacewalks to replace the last bunch of old station batteries.Once the six new lithium-ion batteries are installed, the orbiting lab should be good for the rest of its operational life, according to NASA. The big, boxy batteries — more powerful and efficient than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries coming out — keep the station humming when it\u0027s on the night side of Earth.The battery replacements began in 2017, with previous crews putting in 18 lithium-ion batteries, half as many as the old ones replaced.Cassidy and Behnken have six more to plug in before the job is complete. It\u0027s cumbersome work: Each battery is about a yard (meter) tall and wide, with a mass of 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Their spacewalks are expected to continue through July before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

I was stressed.\u0026nbspWhen I tried to tell them I had been tortured, the interviewer didn’t ask me any other questions about it or try and find out about what had happened to me,\u0027 says asylum seeker Isaac“As soon as we got into the room I felt as though I wasn’t welcome,” says Isaac*, an asylum seeker from Central Africa, as he remembers his interview with the Home Office three years ago. The young man, who was claiming asylum on the grounds that he was tortured in his home country for attending anti-government protests, had been nervous before arriving at the interview. He quickly discovered the process was even more nerve-racking than he had feared.“It wasn’t an interview – it was an interrogation,” he says. “To me, an interrogation is just when you are interviewing a criminal, and someone who has committed a crime.“The Home Office caseworker asked Isaac more than 300 questions over four hours, yet he recalls that he wasn’t offered any water: “My throat was dry. I was stressed. I’m not used to cold, and it was cold at the time. All of these things definitely had an impact on my interview.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIsaac, who is in his early thirties and and was a businessman in his home country, was subsequently refused asylum, and is now awaiting a decision on his appeal.He is one of 30 survivors of torture whose asylum case files have been reviewed as part of new research into the experience of the asylum interview for torture survivors seeking asylum in the UK. The report, by charity Freedom from Torture, concludes that the Home Office repeatedly breaches its own guidelines during asylum interviews and “lets down many of those it is supposed to protect”.Surge in asylum seekers waiting longer than half a year for decision Home Office contractor admits it put vulnerable asylum seekers at riskMore than half of immigration and asylum appeals are now successful, official figures show, with more than 23,000 people seeing their refusals overturned after appealing decisions in the 12 months to March last year, prompting concern about asylum decision making – and the quality of the interviews.Transcripts of Isaac’s interview, seen by The Independent, show that he brought up his experience of torture a number of times, but that the caseworker didn’t follow up on these disclosures.At one point, on being asked where he was taken after being arrested, Isaac said: “Everyone started beating and started asking questions and telling me I was the one who was inciting, propagating insurrection” – but the caseworker proceeded to ask only how many people were present. Later on in the interview, Isaac stated that he “received torture and beating” while detained, and then goes on to explain that someone helped him clean the wound he obtained from this, but the caseworker at no point in the interview asked for further detail about his experience of torture.Describing the line of questioning, Isaac says: “When I tried to tell them that I had been tortured, the interviewer didn’t ask me any other questions about it or try and find out about what had happened to me.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It makes it impossible to give the right information that they need.”The findings of Freedom from Torture’s report, based on reviews of transcripts of asylum interviews carried out by the Home Office in 2017 or 2018 and a series of focus groups and interviews involving 25 torture survivors who had attended asylum interviews, shows they were often prevented from giving a full account of their experiences or denied the opportunity to explain their evidence.Majority of immigration appeals against Home Office now successfulThe report states that some Home Office case workers were found to employ “poor questioning technique” and were “likely to default to disbelieving the survivor” during the interviews, with sensitivity and professional approach to claimants “not always maintained”.One excerpt from a transcript included in the report reveals that a caseworker asked a claimant whether they were raped, to which the claimant responded: “Yes beaten and raped and left naked, I don’t like to think about it,” and started to cry. The caseworker then immediately asked the asylum seeker: “How many times were you beaten and raped over the five days?” In other cases, asylum seekers spoke of male interpreters being allocated when a female interpreter had been requested, or allocation of an interpreter who spoke the incorrect dialect or poor English, making it more difficult for them to explain their account fully to the caseworker.Ahmad, from the Middle East, meanwhile describes having to explain being tortured for freedom of expression in his home country through an interpreter who he said couldn’t speak a high standard of English.“Imagine trying to explain that there had been a massacre, and your translator having to search for the appropriate word on google,” he says. “I can speak some English, and when I heard the interpreter translating my words wrong, I would try to speak for myself, but the interviewer kept on telling me to answer in Arabic for the translator.Windrush report finds“I tried to explain that I needed to speak for myself as the interpreter was not saying what I was saying, but I was silenced. Worse yet, between the agonising misinterpretations – they didn’t even get to the bottom of my story.”Ahmad was initially refused asylum, but was granted on appeal. He has now completed a master’s and plans to become a pharmacist.He adds: “My application was denied because of the issues with my interpreter. When I saw what the Home Office thought my story was, it was completely wrong. The interpreter had mistranslated my story into a different version of the truth.”Sonya Sceats, chief executive of Freedom from Torture, said the report’s findings shone a light on the Home Office’s “culture of disbelief” in the wake of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review – which attributed the Windrush scandal in part to a “culture of disbelief and carelessness” in the department – and called for fundamental culture changes in the system.“It is yet another illustration of how a system corrupted by a culture of hostility and exclusion contributes to the misery and desperation of people in need of help. There have been glimmers of light and an acknowledgment of the need for change. But strong action is essential,” she said.“In the context of a powerful movement for race equality and in the face of evidence showing the harmful impact on vulnerable people, the Home Office can no longer turn a blind eye to the injustice and hostility hardwired into the asylum system.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protest for Justice for Shukri Abdi on Trafalgar Square in London, following a raft of Black Lives Matter protests  across the UKPolice at the scene of an incident at the Park Inn Hotel in central Glasgow.

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline. Former Love Island contestant Joshua Ritchie, who was allegedly among those who turned up at the beach, was seen carrying a large speaker with friends in a video.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman declined to comment on particular scenes on beaches, but told reporters: “The prime minister and the government’s scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.“It is only due to the public’s hard work that we have been able to bring the virus under control, and if the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will have to look at having to reverse some of the easements that have been put in place and I don’t think anyone in the British public would want that to happen.”There were hundreds of kids grouped up on the Roath Park Rec earlier this evening. They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We have seen flare-ups across the country already over recent weeks,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“Just in the last three or four weeks in particular, there was the example of a flare-up in one particular hospital over infection control.“There will be support going into Leicester, and in fact, the health secretary was in touch with many of us over the weekend explaining some of the measures, the support on testing, resources that are going in for the local authority as well.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyBritain’s potential first local lockdown could happen “within days”, The Sunday Times first reported.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been examining legal aspects of the shutdown after 658 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in the Leicester area in the two weeks up to 16 June.Mr Hancock was reported to be considering “all options”.Leicester’s mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, told the Leicester Mercury that the city was still looking at which “interventions” might be needed.“We know that the number of hospital admissions is going down locally and mercifully so is the number of deaths. That is the only firm data we have,” Sir Peter added. He said the city council had received information from the government on Thursday to help them understand “which parts of the city might have a particular issue with transmission”.The council would work through the data over the weekend, he said, adding: “Until we have done that we do not know what interventions might be required.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This advice is there to protect communities and save lives.”The Sunday Times said Leicester’s rise in cases follows an outbreak in food production plants in the area and reports of large crowds gathering outside takeaway restaurants.Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said defining the lockdown area would be “one of the biggest problems” as well as making it understandable for people.He said: “Local authority boundaries can run down the middle of the street with one side in one local authority and the opposite another.“Urban sprawl has allowed towns and cities to expand, resulting in these areas often joining other areas who identify differently and do not see themselves as part of the expanding town or city.“Locking down at the regional level would be seen as unfair or worse as Leicester City has really very little to do with rural Lincolnshire.“People do not identify with their regional boundaries and many would not actually know where they are.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The project manager from Colindale felt “guilty” about sitting at home while supported by taxpayer money through the furlough scheme. “I wanted to help others,” he said. He and his girlfriend signed up to work one day a week at OneStonegrove.He said: “We have spoken about doing this when it’s all over. It’s great to help out.”Readers have just three more days to bid for a piece of Sir Peter’s Blake’s pop artwork, Our Fans, to raise money for Help The Hungry. The auction of the giant mural – which echoes Sir Peter’s design of The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album and was draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel during its 2017 renovation – closes at midnight on Friday.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.The task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The new coalition government in Ireland is facing criticism for its failure to bring in voices from Northern Ireland, despite a commitment towards building a ‘shared island’.After being elected Taoiseach on Saturday, Micheal Martin had the opportunity to nominate 11 personal choices to the Seanad – Ireland’s upper house. But despite expectations, no one from Northern Ireland made the cut.Whilst there is no obligation for such representation, the apparent oversight is particularly jarring because of the new coalition’s promise to improve cross-border integration. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe programme for government agreed by Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Greens outlined plans for a new unit within the office of the Taoiseach “to work towards a consensus on a shared island,” in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement.The move can be read as a response to growing demand across the island of Ireland for a discussion about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland, particularly in the wake of Brexit – which will leave the region more closely aligned to Dublin and the rest of the EU on trade. The coronavirus pandemic has also shown the importance of all-island co-operation on such matters.Micheal Martin becomes Ireland’s Taoiseach as new coalition is formedThe ‘shared island’ move also comes after Sinn Fein pledged to create a junior minister for Irish unity during an election in which that party made significant gains. While Mary Lou McDonald has called for a referendum on reunification within the next few years, an office planning for closer integration is much more in keeping with the ‘slow and steady’ approach to unity favoured by Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.While the Taoiseach’s appointment of new senators offered an early chance to begin cross-border outreach, critics have expressed disappointment at his failure to choose anyone from Northern Ireland – nationalist or unionist.Emma DeSouza, a Derry woman who has led a legal battle for the EU rights of citizens in Northern Ireland, had been among those considered for a post. She has expressed her disappointment on Twitter, saying, “the row-back on a Northern nomination immediately undercuts the concept of a shared island and will reignite fears that we in the North will be left behind, again.”Northern Ireland will have representation through elected Sinn Fein figures Elisha McCallion and Niall O’Donnghaile.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr O’Donnghaile said that the new Taoiseach’s appointments were a “missed opportunity and perhaps an insight into the credibility of the Gov’s “shared island” proposals that no one from the unionist tradition was nominated to the #Seanad.”He added, “I may have an entirely different view but I believe their voices are necessary \u0026amp important.”In 2018, Leo Varadkar was praised for appointing Armagh farmer and politician Ian Marshall to the Seanad – the first unionist to be represented there since the 1930s – but Marshall is now out, and no one from the unionist community has been selected to fill that spot. Jane Morrice is a unionist who was an architect of the Good Friday Agreement as part of the Women\u0027s Coalition, and later became Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. She has told The Independent that she contacted leaders in the Republic of Ireland offering herself to represent the North in the Seanad.I was hoping for a tap on the shoulder, says Morrice, but I failed to get any substantive replies.Given the unique moment in politics on the island, particularly with the emerging conversations on the Republic\u0027s relationship with the North, an opportunity has been missed to put into practice the Shared Island commitment. Instead, the 11 people chosen to join the new Seanad by the Taoiseach are largely failed Fianna Fail and Fine Gael candidates from February’s general election. However, the majority of choices were women, and the inclusion of activist Eileen Flynn – the first women from a traveller background ever to take such a seat – was roundly praised. “This is a historic day for Traveller women, for Travellers and Irish society,” said the Women’s Council of Ireland. “You will be an excellent voice for women’s rights and social justice.”The discussion around this issue in the past 24 hours is an indication that whatever the new Dublin government has planned for the ‘shared island’ element of this administration, it will be scrutinised carefully not just by Sinn Fein in opposition – but by nationalists and supporters of island-wide integration on both sides of the border.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left.

But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning.

Consider it your solemn duty.THE survey saying a quarter of furloughed workers will lose their jobs is horrying.Nine million are being kept afloat by the bailout. But that ruinous cost will end. At which point more than two million will be added to the dole queue.That will be a bitter blow for many who have enjoyed the lockdown — some packing the beaches yesterday on what would ordinarily be a working day.The bailouts’ end in October spells devastation in particular for the young and low-paid. And it falls to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to recreate the jobs boom of the last decade.At least, post-Brexit, he will have even more tools with which to do it.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Dame Judi Denchs warning that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention this week – and it worked.Launching an impassioned plea to Oliver Dowden to “safely open” ballroom dance studios on my talkRADIO Drivetime show, the Strictly Come Dancing judge teased: “If Oliver is out there, I don’t even mind having a cha-cha-cha with him to show him it is possible to social distance.”Clearly the power of the Queen of Latin remains undiminished.Within hours, Oliver had tweeted: “Shirley, as a Strictly fan, I’m happy to talk about how we can get dancing going safely again. Great offer on the cha-cha-cha – I’ll get practising.”Expect dance studios to be back in business imminently, then.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Being from the UK, it’s one of those gigs I think everyone wants to do. Hopefully next year.“But no f***ing way am I camping. No way. I’d have to build a house for it to work.“I’ve been to so many festivals with my mates but I’ve not done any camping stuff.“I’ve got the worst OCD so I wouldn’t be camping at all. That’s probably why I don’t have crazy stories from festivals.”Essex-born Jonas, whose real name is Guy James Robin, has cemented himself as one of the biggest names in dance music in the past five years, selling more than million records.Today he’s back with summer anthem Naked, featuring US singer MAX, but it won’t be part of a bigger collection after he decided releasing full albums is no longer for him.Jonas said: “I’m not going to be doing an album any time soon. I really enjoy doing singles. I can move quickly with them, especially in the world that I’m in, because the trends are forever changing.“I’m not planning to saturate the market with loads of records, it’s just about putting Naked out and that being my biggest record to date, I hope.”Jonas hopes the song will be “uplting” for people as we come out of lockdown. But as someone who knows nightclubs better than anyone , he insisted there is no chance they can reopen anytime soon.He explained: “Clubs will not work, how can you tell , drunk people to stand a metre or two metres apart  It’s never going to f***ing work.“It wouldn’t work with meI’d had a few drinks. I wouldn’t even know what two metres is at that point.”SHE is usually a Glasto regular and it’s a good bet you will find her partying into the early hours, but Rita Ora will have to make do with her back garden this weekend.The How To Be Lonely singer shared this photo on Instagram while sunbathing at home in her bra in the scorching temperatures.But she didn’t put as much thought into what she’d be wearing as she would have doneshe was heading to Somerset.She captioned the snap: “Can’t find my bikini.”It must have been a welcome relief for her to get outside though, having spent lockdown working hard on new music.She posted another photo of her home studio, where it was C, and wrote: “Hope you are all having fun outside enjoying the sun, meanwhile we’re cutting vocals with no air con.”Just think about all the tunes you’ll have to perform by the time you hit Worthy Farm next year, Rita.The superstar had said her album would be coming in September but her manager has now confirmed it is being pushed back, partly because the coronavirus crisis prevented her from finishing it.Jonathan Dickins said: “It isn’t coming in September. It’ll be ready when it’s ready.“We’re all in the same boat. You’re doing stuff and then suddenly the world stops.“It’ll come when it’s ready. We have music but we’re still working.”It’s been five years since her third album  was released, while January will mark a decade since her breakthrough record  which sold million copies to become one of the biggest records of all time.If Adele has taught us anything with her music, it’s that it will certainly be worth the wait.LITTLE MIX’s Jesy Nelson probably wouldn’t get very far across Worthy Farm in these shoes.She showed off slippers made to look like her pet pooches on Instagram, amid hopes the girl group could be signed up for next year’s festival.They are expected to have released their sixth album by then and could be a perfect signing for a team eager for more female artists.Jesy said in : “We would love to do Glastonbury, it would be incredible for us to do that. I think we’d be able to get a new audience that maybe we don’t have, people who aren’t too sure about Little Mix. We could prove them wrong, change their mind.”The singer, whose song Blue Jumper is out today, was picked up while supporting the band on tour but almost didn’t get to play for a music boss in the crowd.She said: “I’d gone over a little bit on my set. I was about to do my one hit and the stage director said, ‘You need to finish now’.“The head of Universal had just arrived. Richard ran over and was like, ‘No, let her play another’.”FOO FIGHTERS’ incredible  headline set is among a load of performances stream-ing through iPlayer over the weekend. You can also see Beyonce, David Bowie, Blur, George Ezra, Arctic Monkeys and more.THIS year’s festival was due to be the biggest yet but organiser Emily Eavis has insisted ticket holders are in for a bumper event when it s next year.She said they are hoping to roll over much of this year’s line-up, but had already booked loads of acts for , which may even mean making the festival longer.Emily said: “We’re rolling two festivals together for . We’ve got a hell of a lot of surprises and things that we were planning for the thand we’re going to try to get those things going for next year.“Logistically it’s a little bit complicated because we’d already pencilled in many of the acts for . It was one of those very unusual years where you’re quite far ahead, two years ahead, on the line-up. So we’re trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.“We’ve had lots of amazing letters from people with ideas of how we could make it into like a two-week holiday or run over three weekends. There’s lots of ideas going.”Taylor Swt Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney were due to headline this weekend and Emily is hoping they will all be back, especially Beatles legend Paul.She said on BBC  Music: “I really hope he’ll be back next year singing it from the Pyramid and we’ll all be in tears, going, ‘It’s happened, we’re back’.”Me too.SIMON BOYLE - COLDPLAY : THEIR fourth time as headline act and they proved to be one of the greatest ever. CHRIS MARTIN and co won over even the most sceptical festivalgoer and had people in tears with their performance, complete with confetti, light-up bracelets and fireworks.JOE KASPER - DAVE : IT wasn’t just his fantastic performance but meeting his fan Alex Mann, who he got up from the crowd to rap his song Thiago Silva. It was enough to convert workmates I had dragged along to become fans of the Mercury Prize winner and, dare I say, grime.HOWELL DAVIES - LORDE : AT only , she proved to be a cut above when she delivered a standout set, partly from within a huge glass box suspended on stage. The Kiwi’s rousing tracks were lapped up and her visuals included dancers, lasers and clouds of smoke.ELLIE HENMAN - LEWIS CAPALDI : THE moment he swaggered on dressed as Noel Gallagher, I knew this set would be my highlight. At the end he told the massive crowd: “If you haven’t enjoyed it keep it to your f***ing self.” Safe to say, everyone loved it.KESHA has released a tribute to Marc Bolan of T.Rex, who headlined the first Glasto in .

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mukupirnas remains are some of the oldest fossils ever found in Australia.The animal has been classed as an entirely new specices and is a member of a group of animals called Vombatormes.The family also includes creatures such as koalas, modern wombats and their ancient relatives. Scientists have said the discovery increases our understanding how wombats developed digging and burrowing behaviour. Its teeth shows it only ate plants and its arms suggest it would scratch for food on the ground,such as when looking for roots.Despite its massive size however, its not even the biggest wombat-like creature every found.Diprotodon has that honour, weighing in at an impressive ,kg - two tonnes - and surviving until at least , years ago.Dr Robin Beck, from The University of Salford, who led the study, said: Koalas and wombats are amazing animals.But animals like mukupirna show that their extinct relatives were even more extraordinary, and many of them were giants.He added: It tells us a lot about the evolution of wombats, koalas and their relatives.It is remarkable for its large size - this was clearly an impressive, powerful beast.The bones were discovered after drought and strong winds blew the surface of the dry salt lake bed.The freak conditions uncovered the remains of animals that died after getting stuck in the mud millions of years ago.Archaeologists used an acupuncture method to find the bones, pushing metal rods into the soft mud until they hit something hard before digging it up.Mukupirna is now the closest known relative of modern wombats, yet it is still so dferent scientists have given it its own family of creatures - mukupirnidae.It is likely the mega wombat vanished during a global climate sht which saw its scrubby rainforest home vanish.Lusher and more erse forests followed, which will have lead to climate conditions not suited for the mukupirnids.Professor Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales, who was part of the team that first uncovered the bones which have only just been identied in ,hailed it as a mysterious new beast.Julien Louys of Grfith University, who co-authored the study, said: The description of this new family fills a crucial missing piece to the ancient bestiary of Australia.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old from Halax - whose case is being mounted by law firm Leigh Day - had to switch from disability benefit ESA to its replacement Universal Credit when she moved accommodation last year. Unlike most students, those who have “limited capability for work” are able to claim Universal Credit. But Sidra was told she could not undergo a fit-for-work test - because she is a full-time student. That meant she couldn’t be labelled as “limited capability”, so couldn’t get UC. She said: “When I went to the Jobcentre they said I should go to my MP because it’s a loophole that a lot of people get stuck in. “You can’t be eligible until you have the assessment - butyou’re a student, you can’t be assessed. It’s so frustrating.” Sidra, who is studying a Masters in Psychology at University of York, is now applying to the High Court for permission for judicial review. She will argue the policy is unlawful after she was left paying for food, clothes and travel from the separate disability benefit PIP, and forced to borrow money from family. Sidra told the Mirror she has the progressive eye condition retinitis pigmentosa, can barely see out of one eye and cannot see at all out of the other. She is also diagnosed with anxiety and depression, she said. She said: “A lot of my friends have part-time jobs and that’s not something that would be feasible at all for me. “I pay for taxis and transport, assisted tech and it all adds up. “In my studies, everything takes longer. It can take me hours to do what might take someone  half an hour.”The group Disability Rights UK believes the legal action,approved by the courts, could help up to , disabled students in a similar position. Campaigners argue there has been a major loophole in the system since at least . Full-time students in “advanced” education cannot claim UC except in some circumstances, including disability or having a child. A  document confirms full-time students who have “limited capability for work” can get UC - but onlythey’ve “already” been given that status. If they haven’t completed a fit-for-work test by the time they start studying, they can’t claim Universal Credit, the government paper says.  Ken Butler of Disability Rights UK said: Disabled people face additional costs than those without a disability - on average it amounts to £ a month. And unlike their non-disabled peers, disabled students are less likely to be able to find and undertake work. It is only appropriate and fair that disabled students should be able to claim universal credit.” Sidra believesshe qualied for UC, she would get £ to £ a month.

Four mobile testing units have been deployed to the city in recent weeks and thousands of home testing kits have been made available. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is examining the legislation needed for a shutdown after the city reported  new cases in the fortnight to June , the Sunday Times reports.A source has told the paper Mr Hancock is considering all options to bring the flare-up under control. Home Secretary Priti Patel confirmed there will be support going into Leicester, including mobile testing and resources for the council, but did not comment further on what will happen next. It comes after food manufacturer Samworth Brothers confirmed that a handful of staff at its Leicester sandwich factory had contracted the deadly bug. Other cases have been reported at a Sainsburyaposs supermarket, according to the Sun, while five schools have also closed. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, said it was unavoidable for the government to look at ways to slow the spread of the virus in Leicester. Unfortunately the fact that the government is having to contemplate specic measures to control the spread of the virus in Leicester is now unavoidable in order to protect the rest of the country, he told the Sunday Times. Shadow Health Secretary and Leicester MP Jon Ashworth demanded clarity from the government. He told the Mirror: People in Leicester are deeply anxious. We need clarity from ministers about what is planned and locally we need resources to ensure everyone who needs a test can access one quickly. It’s take a whole week for ministers go provide the council with local data. This simply isn’t good enough. Speed is of the essence when dealing with this virus.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had already voiced concerns about the spike in cases in Leicester more than a week ago. He said on June : “Outbreaks are currently taking place in Leicester and Kirklees, where we have sent in mobile testing centres and we are working closely with local councils.” It is understood concerns have mounted in recent days amid a rise in new cases presenting in hospital. Concerns are centred around food processing plants and reports of crowding around some takeaways. One official did not rule out the city imposing local lockdown measures - but indicated they hoped any action would be more tightly targeted at the source. For example, outbreaks in Enfield and Weston-Super-Mare led to GP surgeries and the hospital closing rather than a widespread new lockdown. Itaposs understood a decision is yet to be taken. So far local action has been taken to lock down inidual hospitals and GP surgeries where there has been an outbreak but this situation is more serious than that, although no decision has yet been taken,” a source told the Sunday Times. And one local source suggested the city council knew nothing of a possible local lockdown until reading speculation from central government yesterday. Leicester’s elected City Mayor, Peter Soulsby, said yesterday the current reports of where the outbreak might be were “far too vague to be of any real use.” He added: “There are many dferent communities and neighbourhoods in that local government ward, and we have no way of knowing whichany of them are being adversely affected by the virus. “We’re getting that data now, we’re beginning to crunch that information, and hopefully within the next few days, we’ll be able to know what’s going on there -anything - andwe need to, intervene in the right neighbourhood with the right communities.” It comes as the number of deaths from coronavirus in the UK increased by  yesterday - the lowest Saturday increase in lockdown.

Layla Moran said she struggled with her weight throughout her childhood until she reached ft in - but weighed almost  stone. The Lib Dem leadership candidate said matters came to a head when she broke her leg and was wheelchair-bound for three-month, ballooning in weight. Her stomach was stapled in a process called a sleeve gastrectomy, where a large portion of the stomach is removed leaving only a sleeve for food. The MP, now , told the Sunday Times: It was a really hard decision. And I recognise that in order to be my best self, that is what I needed to do. Iaposm not convinced that I would necessarily have had the confidence to do what I do nowI hadnapost had that boost in my early twenties. In an interview with the newspaper, Ms Moran said she is now down from a size  to a happy size . The surgery came after years of dieting and exercise in which she found it was just really hard for me to lose weight. Ms Moran has previously revealed how she was bullied at school for her weight - and called on public figures and the media to be careful in the obesity debate.  She wrote inlast year: Losing weight, even with the help of the operation I had, remains the hardest thing I have ever done – and the thing I am most proud of. It is unacceptable that others should be put off from making positive choices about their own bodies by the judgment of our media and the lack of empathy in our society. Ms Moran is battling rival Ed Davey to lead the party - with the pair winning the support of three MPs each. Nominations close on July , new members can join by the same date, and ballot papers will be sent out from July . The new leader is set to be confirmed on August .

The Home Secretary made the claim after  MPs united to condemn comments she made on racism in the House of Commons. The MPs said her claim not to take lectures on racism was gaslighting - manipulating someone to doubt their own experiences. But Ms Patel, born to a Ugandan-Indian family in London, claimed the MPs didnapost like that she is a BAME Tory woman adding: That in itself is racist. It comes after Ms Patel was confronted earlier this month by the black Labour MP Florence Eshalomi. The Vauxhall MP had urged Ms Patel to act now on structural inequality, discrimination and racism and askedshe actually understand[s] the anger and frustration felt by people across the UK. But in an exchange that went viral online, Ms Patel replied: It must have been a very dferent Home Secretary who as a child was frequently called a P*** in the playground. A very dferent Home Secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husbandaposs in order to advance her career.  So, when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance for social justice, I will not take lectures from the other side of the House. A group of  Labour MPs later wrote to Ms Patel accusing her of gaslighting them by dismissing their experiences on the basis of her own. Their letter said: We write to you as black, Asian and ethnic minority Labour MPs to highlight our dismay at the way you used your heritage and experiences of racism to gaslight the very real racism faced by black people and communities across the UK. Our shared experiences allow us to feel the pain that communities feel, when they face racism. They allow us to show solidarity towards a common cause they do not allow us to define, silence or impede on the feelings that other minority groups may face.

Ministers wrote to town halls in England today calling on them to reopen any loos that are still shuttered to stop the spread of Covid-. Toilets in parks and other public places were closed from March to prevent transmission of the virus. But that has left many people in a tight spot as parks reopen to social groups of up to six people - but many toilets do not. Local government minister Simon Clarke and environment minister Rebecca Pow wrote to council chiefs today urging them to reopen loos. They said: Councils should consider the harm to public health and the local environment caused by people relieving themselves in public. The ministers warned the situation has got worse as the weather heats up. And people with bowel conditions have told of avoiding trips outdoors altogether due to anxiety about where to find a toilet. They added: Public hygiene is of the upmost importance, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, and enabling residents to access toilets safely is vital. Handwashing is an important activity to help prevent the spread of the virus.  Closed toilets may also impact disproportionately on certain groups who for health reasons rely on access to public toilets to be able to leave their homes. They can also make le dficult for young families and people who work outside. If you have toilets that are still shut, then we strongly urge you to refer to advice on measures that can be taken to open toilets in a safe way.

Jodie Leah Foulger, , and her partner Andy, , decided to make their own workout space after finding out it would cost them up to £, to have it done professionally.The couple, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, despaired when gyms closed in March as part of the coronavirus lockdown, the Daily Star reports.Andy was desperate to keep training and Jodie wanted to get ready for their wedding. Jodie said: “We decided to build the gym because my partner Andy is a huge gym fanatic! Do you have a similar story to share  Email webnews@mirror “When lockdown hit, and the gyms were closed, he was not pleased. So I said – let’s build one... “I also wanted to use the gym for our pre-wedding build up. “We were meant to be getting married in Greece in July , but unfortunately our wedding was postponed until next year.” It took the couple between two and three weeks to build, as Andy does sht work. They fit the DIY job around their regular work patterns, working from home and schooling their six-year-old daughter. Jodie wrote on Facebook : “Neither of us are in the trade.“But, we designed and built the whole lot with no help at all. “It is a custom size and shape to fit into our garden. “We are really pleased with it. The materials the couple used included wood for the entire structure and frame which were X from the couple’s local wood yard. They got the wooden ship lap cladding from the same place. Jodie and Andy picked up some second Hand UPVC windows and French doors for £ from the local scrap yard. The mum added: “The paint for outside of the summer house is  Cuprinol Dusky Gem. “And, the UPVC windows and doors are painted in  Rustoleum universal paint in Slate Grey.“The damaged windows were covered with D- C Fix vinyl window covering. Jodie bought the large mirrors for inside the gym from Ikea online, the garden lights from screw fix and the rugs from Aldi and Lidl. Her outdoor furniture was also from Aldi. The couple designed the gym around the height of the gym equipment that Andy had purchased.  Jodie said: “There wasn’t really a huge drawn out plan. “We discussed it and came up with a plan – we measured as we worked. “Team work was certainly important and thank goodness he’s strong.” She added: “Andy has a really good eye for design and I deal with all of the details. “Together we agreed on the size and height and we made it fit specically to our garden.” If the couple had tried to buy a similar structure they would have been set back between £, and £,.

Amjad Butt, , and his -year-old we Tina splashed out £, last year on the luxurious timber building in their garden in Iris Close, Bournville, Birmingham. But they have now been told the summerhouse contravenes local planning restrictions of the Bournville Village Trust as, at three metres tall, it is one metre too high. The couple now face having to take down the building - which they claim adheres to national planning laws - or radically slash its height and design. Tina, a retired nursing manager, said: We spent £, on the summerhouse, labour, paint and plants and now we don’t know what to do. We can’t enjoy it. The BVT said its aim was to work with householders who want to submit applications for alterations to their homes”. It added the couple had been invited to appeal against the summerhouse decision but had declined to do so.  Retired chartered accountant Amjad and his we had moved to Bournville from London six years ago to enjoy their retirement. Last year they bought the wooden summerhouse from manufacturers Forest and the building was erected at the bottom of their garden. Amjad said: Thelaw says a summerhouse can be four metres high and single storey and we have done everything to communicate with the Trust. It has been manufactured according toplanning laws. The law gave the permission to the industry for the dimensions that it can be four metres high. The manufacturer has used all those dimensions to manufacture it.  All you have to do is check a couple of things, for example the summer house must not take more than  per cent of your garden. So our garden is  feet, and this summer house has taken only  feet of the garden. The couple claim they thoroughly researched the planning laws around outbuildings and believed the trustaposs Bournville Design Guide rules related only to the main house. The BVT launched an investigation after receiving a complaint about the summerhouse from a neighbour.  Two officials made a site visit in October and the couple were later told the structure was one metre too high and contravened strict planning rules of the Bournville Design Guide. Amjad said he understood the BVT was there to protect the heritage of the area and ensure nothing is distorted or tampered with without the permission of the Bournville Trust. He said: That is their main role. But we have not touched our main house, the building.  It is only a summer house, or you could say a gloried shed at the back of the garden which has been put up strictly according to the law. Arthur Tsang, Director of Communities at Bournville Village Trust, said: We are sorry that Mr and Mrs Butt are unhappy with the handling of their application for a summerhouse. Our aim is always to work with customers who want to submit applications for alterations to their homes to make sure they meet the guidance in the Bournville Design Guide and are therefore successful. The Design Guide is partly in place to help manage the balance of buildings and green space that the area and people who live in Bournville enjoy and benefit from.

That means that I’ve had a coronavirus infection and survived because my body responded to Covid- by ­manufacturing antibodies. Antibodies that neutralised the virus. The antibody test I had wasn’t the prick test but the hardcore blood sample from a vein. I had the blood taken at pm on Friday night and the result was ­available at am Saturday morning. Twelve hours. That’s how quickly we need results of swab tests to make the track and trace programme work and set us free from lockdown.  At the present time, NHS results can take anything from  hours to five days, sometimes  days. No tracing system can work with such delays. Contacts have escaped. We’ll never get out of lockdown at that rate. I didn’t seek the antibody test. I had to attend a clinic for something  and I was offered one.

Warren Crossan was shot a number of times in St Katharineaposs Road in west Belfast on Saturday. Police described the murder as callous and reckless. Mr Crossan, who had signicant links to dissident republicans, was followed through streets packed with people and motorists before being killed. His father Tommy Crossan was a prominent dissident republican and was shot dead at a fuel depot in Belfast on Good Friday in . Detective Chief Inspector Darren McCartney said links to organised crime have not been ruled out and it is too early to speculate on a motive. He said: This is a callous and reckless killing. Bringing firearms out into residential streets of west Belfast in broad daylight just beggars belief. The gunmen did not give any thought to the risk this posed to the residents and members of the public carrying out their everyday business in the area. One of these shots struck a vehicle belonging to a local resident and that just goes to show the callousness that these gunmen had.  While it is too early to speculate on a motive for the murder, links to an organised crime element have not been ruled out. However, I must state that the investigation is at a very early stage. It will take its course and I will follow the evidence wherever it takes my team over the coming days.  It is understood one of the potential lines of inquiry is a link to the recent murder in north Belfast in April of Dubliner Robbie Lawlor. Lawlor, , was gunned down outside a house in Etna Drive in Belfast in April. Lawlor had previously been linked with the murder of teenager Keane Mulready-Woods in Co Louth in January. Askedpolice are co-operating with Gardai in the Republic of Ireland about this potential link, Det McCartney said: It is a very early stage in the investigation but I am ruling absolutely nothing out at this time.

In a touching message, Jamie Barrett, captain of Gresley Football Club, said he is so proud of the woman I married.Jamie, , and Leanne, , met  years ago during a night out, Derbyshire Live reports.He said: It was a rollercoaster especially towards the end. You never quite realise how devastating cancer is until it happens to someone you love. I just want everyone to know how proud I was of the woman I married. The couple, who lived in Rolleston, married in  and had daughter India-Lily, who is now six. But shortly after Leanne fell pregnant with the couple’s second child, a son called Beau, the recruitment consultant was diagnosed with lung cancer in October . Jamie added that his we had an infectious personality. He said: When she walked in the room she would start up the conversation and she was chatty, bubbly, outgoing, obviously beautul but very caring as well.  She loved her family, she liked fitness and was always a member of the gym and she liked spending money, mainly on handbags and shoes. She was just a fun, happy person. After receiving the devastating news the couple did not knowtheir son would live and it was Leanneaposs strength and courage throughout her battle that made him love her even more, he has said. Being pregnant when she was diagnosed was a double blow but she protected our son for as long as she could, even though she was in pain.  It was hard for us dealing with the diagnosis and having a newborn. We didn’t knowhe would survive but she was always trying to be positive for our little girl. The last  months were horrendous. The only thing that kept us going was our children. Leanneaposs cancer spread to other parts of her body and she ended up spending time at St Giles Hospice in Whittington where staff helped manage her pain, but even then she did all she could to put her family first.  Jamie said: The cancer kept outsmarting all the treatment she was having and she gradually got worse through lockdown and ended up going to St Giles so they could manage her pain. Leanne died on June  leaving Jamie heartbroken, but he says her legacy will live on in their children. Now Jamie said he is battling on and would like to thank everyone for their support during Leanneaposs illness and after her death including those who donated to a fund-raiser which helped towards Leanne’s treatment.

And today, as millions have piled on the lockdown pounds, we focus on resetting your diet again...  From banana bread to sourdough and burger sauce, the list of ­lockdown food trends has been long. So it’s no surprise the ­pandemic has had a ­signicant impact on our ­eating habits. Research conducted by Slimming World showed a third of UK adults are eating more sugary foods , nearly one in fiveare consuming more fatty foods, and % are drinking more sugary drinks. Around a fth are eating less fruitand % less veg. Thankfully, there is some good news. Slimming World’s Health and Wellbeing Study of , people also revealed that % said they were finding home cooking more enjoyable than before lockdown, and halfsaid they’re ordering less ­takeaways. Lots of us will be thinking we don’t want to end this time heavier than when we started it. But don’t worry, that doesn’t mean sales of lettuce leaves and celery sticks are about to go the way of toilet roll and yeast – in fact, Slimming World says going hungry is not the route to go downyou want to lose weight. Slimming World’s ­dietitian Carolyn Pallister says: “We might think we need to be overly strict when losing weight, but this approach leaves us more hungry. This is one of the reasons many people ‘fall off the wagon’ and this can leave us feeling guilty, often leading to yo-yo dieting.” Research by ­Slimming World and the University of Leeds showed a diet based on low energy dense foods – foods that contain fewer calories per gram – such as fruit and veg, lean meat and rice, allows people to reduce calories while eating more, not less, and is more effective for weight-loss than calorie-counting. Carolyn adds: “By filling up on low energy dense foods, people can feel more satisfied and lose weight so they are able to stay on track.” These delicious recipes show how, with Slimming World’s Food Optimising plan, you can lose weight and not go hungry. Explaining energy density Gram for gram, low energy dense foods contain fewer calories than high energy density foods, so people are able to eat a larger volume of food for the samecalorie intake, leading them to feel much fuller. For example, someone would have to eat around g of carrots to consume  calories, whereas it would take just g of chocolate to achieve a similar calorie intake, yet the greater volume of carrots is likely to make you much fuller.

Tricia Scoullar was surrounded by friends and family when she sadly died, with relatives saying she fought until her last breath to stay with them. Daughter Clare has paid tribute to her much-loved mum, reports the Liverpool Echo. Mum and nan Tricia was just  when she suffered a seizure which lead to the discovery and diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multorme- the most aggressive form of cancer that begins with the brain. Clare, of Woolton, began fund-raising alongside the rest of the family to try and gather money for experimental treatment. Since her mumaposs seizures and subsequent cancer diagnosis, Clare and the rest of the family devoted much of their time to looking after Tricia and trying to improve her quality of le. The tumours on Triciaaposs brain lead to her having some issues with her speech a bit like a stutter and becoming confused when speaking. But towards the end of her le, Tricia could only say yes or no. Clare, , and her family fund-raised for experimental treatment in Mexico to try and prolong her le, while improving the quality of her condition too. But Tricia died on June  leaving her entire family grappling with grief. Clare said: Itaposs just heartbreaking - people tell you to prepare for the worst but how can you prepare to lose your mum  We got the money for the treatment, we went to Germany - we were meant to be going to Mexico but she couldnapost do the flight. Itaposs  hours so it was too much for her so we went to Germany instead. Her blood marker was really high, you have a cancer blood marker that tells you how much cancer is in your body and hers was higher than a normal cancer patientaposs - it came down a bit when we were in Germany and we were going for walks and getting out and about, then we came home and were on  lockdown. We couldnapost do anything but we never gave up hope and she fought until her last breath.  Tricia battled her cancer for  months and was surrounded by close family, including Clareaposs brother Paul and their dad, Michael, when she died. Clare added: There was about seven or eight of us close family in the room when she died. She didnapost want to leave me and our Paul and our dad. By the end, she couldnapost talk or walk - she could only say yes or no and even then, she got them confused. Itaposs just heartbreaking, thereaposs not enough research into Glioblastoma - when you give donations to the likes of Marie Curie, Macmillon or Cancer Research, only % goes directly to brain cancer research so you need to donate directly to brain cancer. People donapost live  months with it but she lived  months, sheaposs done amazing. She didnapost want to go, she loved her grand-kids and she was very family orientated and that kept her going. But it felt like she was being eaten from the inside and she was trapped in her own body in the end. It was absolutely heartbreaking - I think Iaposm just on autopilot at the moment. Clare and her family are planning a funeral, though with a limited number of attendees to comply with government guidance, and have been making banners in Cadbury purple, which was Triciaaposs favourite colour. Clare said: The first day she had the seizure, my entire le changed and the whole family just tried everything. We had the charity night on the st of February and thataposs people who havenapost got anything and they still helped us. Or businesses and companies that donated prizes, it was just amazing. Clare and her mumaposs story touched many people, with strangers reaching out to contact the family to offer their support and condolences. Clare said: I put it on Facebook that she had passed and you should see the comments - I havenapost been able to read them all yet because itaposs so overwhelming but Iaposve gone through and liked them all because Iaposm not ignorant. Iaposll read them properly later, when itaposs not too much. Itaposs incredible though having strangers messaging me saying how my mum touched their lives - she was loved by so many people.

But George is aposa little grumpyapos about the fact Louis is winning, Kate revealed. Kate gave the insight into how her family have been keeping occupied during lockdown while she was helping to create a new garden for a childrenaposs hospice. The keen gardener joined families from East Angliaaposs Childrenaposs Hospicesto plant a garden at The Nook, one of Eachaposs purpose-built hospices near Norwich, on Thursday. Using plants bought during a visit last week to Fakenham Garden Centre near her Norfolk home of Anmer Hall, Kate worked alongside a volunteer gardener, staff and two families to help create a new horticultural design for a large patio area. Marking the end of Childrenaposs Hospice Week, Kate taught Star Pope-Saunders, , her brothers Hudson, eight, and six-year-old Sonny how to loosen the plants from their pots to replant them. As she planted sunflowers with the children, she revealed that Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are having a sunflower-growing competition, with the youngest sibling currently in the lead. Kate, dressed in a summery floral dress, said: The children are really enjoying growing their sunflowers, Louisaposs is winning so George is a little grumpy about that! The sunflower has been adopted as the emblem of hospice care, a symbol of joy with the seeds representing patients and the surrounding petals as love, care and compassion.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was the Pope-Saunders familyaposs first time at The Nook with Sonny, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour shortly after his birthday in February.His mother Kelly Pope-Saunders, from Norwich, said after the royal visit: She said they are having a sunflower-growing competition and Louis is winning, much to Georgeaposs annoyance. It was so nice to see her - and in such a lovely dress too - getting stuck in.Kate earlier told the family: Iaposm always so blown away by families like yours, particularly having to go through all of this in lockdown. You show such resilience and bravery. Youaposre such an inspiration to us all. More people in the country should meet families like you, thereaposs a huge amount of change for you all to take on and you have coped fantastically. Kate also met Liam and Lisa Page, whose three-month-old son Connor was born with severe brain damage on March . The duchess said: Going through lockdown at the same time, when you canapost see your loved ones, you canapost share with people - there arenapost other families necessarily here that you can share your experience with.  Kate and the families worked with sensory plants such as lavender, bay and rosemary, and the garden also contains strawberry plants, herbs, geraniums and hydrangeas in a calming lilac colour scheme. Tracy Rennie, Eachaposs acting chief executive, said Kate wanted to create a patio garden and was given a brief to include plants with smells and bright colours. Ms Rennie added: She was absolutely prepared to get her hands dirty - she didnapost need the gardening gloves we offered her - and even plunged her hands into the earth with that massive engagement ring on. The duchess also re-potted a large sunflower that she donated to Each in memory of nine-year-old Fraser Delf, who died in January this year at the Milton hospice in Cambridge.  Kate and the Duchess of Cornwall recently spoke to Fraseraposs family on a video call. In a message about Childrenaposs Hospice Week, Kate said: This Childrenaposs Hospice Week, Iaposd like to thank the amazing staff for all the work that you do in childrenaposs hospices around the UK.

The Village Bar Cafe at Killay Precinct, Swansea, opened at reduced hours on June , allowing people to buy takeaway drinks. But local residents have expressed their concerns after noticing anti-social behaviour at night.The issue has intimidated residents and made pensioners scared to go shopping, Wales Online reports.  The baraposs owner, Martyn Jenkins, said the venue operated within the current coronavirus guidelines and that local authorities and businesses supported their decision to open.He said the trial opening aimed to bring le in the area and the business back to normal. However, following the concerns raised by local residents about the number of people gathering in Killay Square, Mr Jenkins said the trial opening has not turned out as we planned. The bar has now stopped trading at weekends. One local resident said he saw no social distancing when he was around the area with his daughter at around pm on Friday, June . He said: I was walking past Killay Square with my -year-old at around .pm on Friday. There must have been hundreds of people talking and drinking beer. Many of them were in their s and unlikely to be from the same family. There was no social distancing at all. It was quite a scary experience for my daughter. On a normal day during lockdown youaposd see three or four people at the square max. I feel for the older people trying to get essentials at the Co-op. The queue for the shop, because of social distancing, backs onto the square. Another resident said she saw men urinating on walls in the area and said it was not very pleasant for adults or children in the area. Councillor for Killay South, Jeff Jones said he will be taking part in discussions with local businesses and PCSOs to seeanything more can be done to allow businesses to trade without impacting negatively on locals. He said: We have been inundated - absolutely inundated with complaints. They reopened a few weeks ago and there were problems from the start. The police have attended every week. The Village has confirmed it is operating within the guidelines. The issue is that with it, there are repercussions.  There is still supposed to be social distancing, but people might be standing too close to each other. It is also the only bar in the area to have opened, so they may be getting customers from other venues. Killay is a lovely area with a very low level of crime. There are a lot of elderly people in the area and the last thing they want is to squeeze past lots of people who are drinking to get where they need to go. The other problem is, when there is drinking, people need to urinate. There are no public toilets open and people might instead urinate on the street. We understand that venues might need to operate so we will be discussing how we might be able to improve the situation. Owner Mr Jenkins apologised to anyone who felt uncomfortable following the baraposs opening despite their efforts to encourage social distancing and to keep disruption to a minimum. The bar had been opening for three hours between pm and pm on Thursdays and Fridays and for four hourson Saturday to prevent crowds and anti-social behaviour at night. [On Friday, June ] we took the decision not to re-open as a take-away and have advised licensing. We are a small independent family business and it was not our intention to cause an adverse effect on our local community and we apologise to anyone who while using the precinct has felt uncomfortable, said Mr Jenkins. In addition to local authorities, we notied the owners of the precinct itself and local shop keepers - all were supportive as they recognised the benefit of having people use the precinct. We display clear signage regarding social distancing, advise everyone who purchases a drink to comply with this, regularly walk around the precinct to enforce distancing and clear away any mess.

The number of worldwide coronavirus cases has now passed  million since the start of the pandemic, new figures confirmed today. But there were no confirmed deaths from the virus on Friday or Saturday north of the border, officials announced. However, the biggest problem in keeping the current infection levels is an open border with England. She told the BBC: If Scotland was an island - like New Zealand - I would say going for zero cases would be completely feasible. I think Scotland is on track to eliminate coronavirus by the end of the summer by looking at the rate of the decrease in new cases. But we are going to see little bumps, so itaposs a question of how small can you keep those bumps. She added: July is a crucial month for people to follow the rules and guidance, and be sensible because the virus is still around and can still increase quite fast within days and weeks.

After going through gruelling cancer treatment, she had just a  per cent chance of conceiving – but conceive she did. Then husband Daniel caught Covid-, and in the final two weeks of pregnancy Kate fell ill with the virus too. Two weeks after their baby was born, the little mite also succumbed. Today we are delighted to report that mum, dad and baby Ostara are fully recovered. We are also pleased to offer a glimmer of hope that the disease might be weakening.

And he amassed a legion of followers after his proud daughter Julianna tweeted his journey and the MTV style video. In the clip, Ed stretched out his arms and jokes “welcome to my crib” as he starts the tour. Ed takes viewers on a tour of his gorgeous café complete with desk, chairs and an extensive drinks menu. A few weeks ago Ed had told his family: “Yeah I think I’m gonna build a coffee shop in the backyard.” They all thought he was joking but after three months of hard work, La Vida was open for business in their back garden. Ed is a contractor and had squirrelled away old materials and items others would deem as rubbish which he repurposed to create his coffee shop.  This included the building structure, doors and the front window.As shown in the video, the mini cafe is kitted out with tables, chairs. Thereaposs even little succulent plants for decoration and tea lights for when it gets dark.

It was set up by Kimaposs father, Kim Jong-il, in . Without it, the North Korean dictator would not be able to live his le of luxury while the rest of the population faces poverty and famine.  David Maxwell, a former US Army Special Forces colonel and expert on North Korea, told the New York Post : “Where do you think Kim gets his cognacs, Mercedes and Rolex watches “All the money to buy that stuff comes from Office .” And Sean King, an Asia specialist at Park Strategies in New York, told the newspaper: “The Kims are like an organized crime family masquerading as the leaders of a country.” He said North Korean embassies around the world are set up like a multinational criminal enterprise. It is claimed that slave labour, counterfeiting, gold smuggling, drug dealing and selling arms are just some of the illicit activities Office  is responsible for.  Earlier this year rumours spread that Kim had died during heart surgery, only for him to re-emerge weeks later in a blaze of publicity. But he has been quiet of late, with speculation mounting that he is hiding out in the coastal resort of Wonsan, possibly trying to keep himself safe from Covid-. The secretive Office  is said to have a base in capital Pyongyang, and diplomats are dispatched around the world to carry out illegal activities.

Police discovered the child during an animal rescue operation on Thursday in Henry County, Tennessee. The childaposs mum Heather Scarbough, , his stepdad, Thomas Jefferson Brown, , and his grandfather, Charles Brown, , were arrested and are facing multiple charges. Henry County Sherf Monte Belew told a press conference on Friday the tot was found among eight snakes,  dogs,  rabbits,  chickens, one gecko, four parakeets, three cats, one pheasant, three sugar gilders, and  mice, rats, and hamsters. He said: In the living room youaposve got a kid caged, youaposve got  snakes and youaposve got the snakes feed butted up against the childaposs cage. Eight snakes in the same room, then mice running everywhere. Mr Belew added that it was evident the child spent most of his le in the cage.  He added: It was heartbreaking to see the conditions this child was living in. There was nothing for that baby in the entire house outside of the cage he was in. All his toys were in there with him. There were no other toys, no crib, no blankets for him. It appeared he spent mostnot all his time in the cage, and the ammonia smell that came up when we lted the cage and the bugs that were under it makes it appear ashe stayed in there a lot.  Officers described the kitchen as unliveable after spotting “thousands of cockroaches and maggots.The entire property was in disarray with rotting food and rubbish scattered around the grounds. Mr Belew added: “There was trash and food on top of the cage . “And you can tell when a child is starving and hungry, and he was starving.  “He needed to be out of there, and the animals did, too.” The child is now in the custody of the Department of Child Services. Police also found  marijuana plants and seventeen guns at the property.

not even those who waited for  minutes without waterproofs.Teachers did their best to shelter some of the smaller ones under umberellas and raincoats.Bedraggled Union flags and Lion Rampants were used by some children to cover their heads.The children got their reward when the Queen passed and gave them a beaming smile on the way to Camperdown Works which was for a time the world’s largest jute works, boasting  power looms,  hand looms and more than , workers.The greatest landmark at Camperdown Works was the -foot high brick chimney Cox’s Stack which was built by James MacLaren in  and modelled on Italian bell towers.The chimney stalk could be seen from almost any point in the city.The Cox family built it to ensure smoke from the furnaces was carried well above the nearby workers’ houses.The Queen and Prince Philip were given a tour of the weaving factory by Sir William Walker, chairman and joint managing director of Jute Industries Limited.From a  in the lower factory the Queen and Prince Philip saw the impressive sight of  looms in one floor all working below them.The royal couple went down to speak to the workers including -year-old Margaret Cooper whose family had strong connections to Camperdown Works.Mrs Cooper had been there for  years and also serving in the same department were her four daughters who were all weavers and the husbands of three of the daughters who were tenters.Four-year-old Ann Bonar, who was the “oldest sitting tenant” of the works’ nursery having been there since she was six months # was chosen to present the Queen with a bouquet of cream roses before her departure.“They all look very sweet,” said Prince Philip to the nursery’s matron.The royal couple moved on to Dundee Royal Infirmary afterwards to open the new radio diagnostic department.The matron Annie O’Dey offered the Queen a pair of embossed silver scissors in a blue padded case before the ceremony.“I hope they will cut,” she said.One snip was enough to sever the broad white silk ribbon across the double doors.Dr Cecil Pickard, consultant radiologist and chief of the department, and Dr George Grant, consultant radiologist, conducted the royal couple on a -minute tour of the new facility.The rain had thinned the crowds by the time the pipes and drums of the  th Battalion of The Black Watch led a guard of  to the City Square.Shortly before .pm the royal couple arrived to cheers from the crowd to have lunch in the City Chambers.The couple left afterwards along Riverside Drive before a final visit to Queen’s College which would go on to become the University of Dundee.mdash UoD Archives  RMJune , Four undergraduates provided a ‘Walter Raleigh’ touch to proceedings.The Queen and Prince Philip were walking to their car when the students laid down their gowns on the wet road between the door of the college and the car.The Queen smiled her thanks.The couple left for Edinburgh following the visit.The city of Dundee has been graced with numerous visits from the Queen.The Courier’s earliest photograph of the Queen in Dundee is of Princess Elizabeth shopping with her grandmother, the Countess of Strathmore, at Webster’s Toy Shop in Whitehall Crescent in the s.Following her visit in  she continued to show an interest in Dundee’s industry when she ed to the city in , taking in Douglasfield Works and The NCR Gourdie Factory.In , she wowed onlookers with a stunning outfit as she left aat the City Chambers.The Queen’s jubilee visit also including planting a tree at Camperdown and meeting a group of Sea Cadets.Prince Philip famously stopped at the Windmill Bar in the Hilltown during the visit and pointed up at the windows before acknowledging the cheers of the regulars.In the evening, after the visit, staff and regulars agreed to send a letter to the duke about the bar.They produced three poems which were copied out on the back of a print of the bar and handed in to the Queen’s bodyguard at Dundee City Chambers.They were amazed some days later to receive a poem in reply, simply titled The Windmill Bar and signed Philip, thanking the regulars for their welcome.In  the Queen received an enthusiastic welcome in Dundee.During her visit she opened WL Gore, went on board the Discovery and greeted the crowds who came out to meet her in City Square.The s saw the Queen make two trips to the City of Discovery, the first in  to visit Expo  and the second to open the University of Abertay in .In , the Queen arrived in the city wearing a striking red coat and hat, which she wore when visiting the University of Dundee Chaplaincy and The Shore, while accompanied by Prince Philip.The couple ed to the city in  and officially opened the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at Dundee University.They also met apprentices working at the Michelin tyre factory in Baldovie before the Queen visited the waterfront and opened Slessor Gardens.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor. Just find some space, make some tasty treats and connect with friends and family online.Although we are all still respecting social distancing and cannot meet in groups, we can still share experiences together and create happy memories.  And when lockdown finally ends we can do it all again, but this time in person.To find out more and to get your free pack, visit the Family Action website.David Holmes CBE, Family Action Chief Executive Officer, London"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll golf clubs tee off as lockdown eases","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs across the region are planning to re-open on a limited basis on Friday May , following the latest Scottish Government guidance.Lochgilphead Golf Club#s course will be open to members only in the first instance and members must pre-book tee times in line with Scottish Golf guidelines.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

infected person will pass the virus to on average.Coronavirus has an estimated reproduction number of three, meaning an infected person will likely pass the virus on to at least three other people.A

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

withthe UK Government set to announce so-called air bridges to popular destinations.Since March , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised British nationals against all but essential international travel.Now, a number of short-haul flights to European countries are expected to resume from next month in a bid to kick-start the tourist economy.This is what you need to know about air bridges and travelling abroad.What are air bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trialling thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures of arriving passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending machines selling four masks for pound.Pre-booked airport security slots are being trialled at Manchester

especially for those with undiagnosed or asymptomatic illnesses.ldquoYoung people who are abusing it are taking huge risks themselves and for their friends as well.ldquoOne of the problems is that there are legitimate uses for the capsules, especially in the catering industry.ldquoThere needs to be a well-rounded approach to tackling this latest trend, involving education, support from the police and responsible vendors.Mr Gray was similarly keen to see the issue tackled and encouraged anyone with information to contact the police.He said: ldquoThere have been widespread reports of large numbers of these discarded canisters being found in areas across the UK over recent weeks.ldquoThe fact that so many were found in one place here suggests that this is also a problem locally and one that will undoubtedly be of concern to parents.ldquoIrsquom pleased to see that a multiagency response is being pursued to help tackle the issue, and would certainly echo what has been said about parents discussing the potential risks with their children and reporting any relevant information to the police.Ch Insp Mitchell urged parents, writing in his Courier column: ldquoPlease do all you can to talk to your children, discuss the dangers of these canisters and of the impact of anti-social behaviour.ldquoEventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has been and please

Some pupils may have learnt new skills and may be rethinking their path because of new experiences and we look forward to hearing about those experiences.ldquoMore importantly, we look forward to welcoming our children back to school and are excited to see them again in August.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos wellbeing, praised the efforts of parents, carers and teaching staff during lockdown.She said: ldquoStaff across our schools especially our headteachers have been working tirelessly and around the clock to pull together plans based on government advice.ldquoMany parents and carers will be pleased to hear that schools will be going back full-time in August.

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise.

weve pulled together alist of the best on-screen locations across the country to visit once lockdown eases.Harry PotterWhere: Glenfinnan, Highlands,The famous Glenfinnan Viaduct features in both the second and third Harry Potter films ndash with the Hogwarts Express even calling at Glenfinnan station.Tourists flock to the area every year for the stunning scenery surrounding the railway ndash perched ft above the ground.SkyfallWhere: Glen Etive, HighlandsJames Bondrsquos epic Skyfall experience saw him in Istanbul, a skyscraper in Shanghai and an abandoned island in Japan.But it was the breath-taking scenes in Glencoe that captured the eye of  fans across the globe.TrainspottingWhere: EdinburghAn iconic film based right in Scotlandrsquos capital, itrsquos almost dficult to NOT find yourself near one of the sets for the Trainspotting films.Almost half the scenes of T were filmed right in the city ndash from Renton and Spudrsquos run around Holyrood Park and Arthurrsquos Seat, to the epic escape from the nightclub through Edinburghrsquos Old Town.And who can forget the original opening scene ndash with drug-afflicted Renton sprinting down Princes Street to the sound of Iggy Pop.Outlaw KingWhere: VariousDiving deep into the legends of one of Scotlandrsquos most important historical figures, it makes sense for a film about a travelling outlaw to be set across ious dferent locations in Scotland.From the Catheral in Glasgow, to Scone Palace just outside Perth ndash there is plenty of Robert the Bruce history to keep you occupied on a tour of the country.Full details of Outlaw King locations can be found here.Avengers: Infinity WarWhere: EdinburghOnce again the capital played host to a major blockbuster film ndash Marvelrsquos Avengers: Infinity War ndash back in .And as the only location outside of a studio to be used in the film, Edinburgh is truly a star of the film.Cockburn Street in the cityrsquos Old Town first appears when Scarlet Witch and Vision stand outside a fast-food restaurant.The Royal Mile then became a thrilling backstop in the film, with convincing explosions and breath-taking action scenes.Avengers: EndgameWhere: St Abbs, BordersOne of the most successful films of all time, Avengers: Endgame also used Scotland as the location for some of its scenes.The fishing village of St Abbs in the Borders was renamed lsquoNew Asgardrsquo, and saw movie star Chris Hemsworthdescend on the town to film some scenes.According to the local leboat, who have jokingly said the village is now lsquotwinnedrsquo with the fictional village, the filmmakers Marvel made a ldquogenerous donation to the leboat.World War ZWhere: George Square, GlasgowIn ,  cast and crew ndash including Brad Pitt ndash descended on the streets of Glasgow city centre to film the zombie blockbuster World War Z.American cars and street lights were brought in to resemble Philadelphia, the filmrsquos setting.George Square can be seen from  seconds in this trailer here:Where: Govan Graving Docks, GlasgowOscar and Bafta-award-winning war epic  is one of the newer films to be shot in Scotland -

Perhaps with all of the usual white noise of le stripped away, something deep-rooted in my memories has stirred and bubbled to the surface.I was less than a year old at my first gala day in . While I dont remember it, I know from photographs that my gran pulled out all the stops. The outside of her house and garden was beautully adorned with colourful bunting and decorations.This was a tradition that continued throughout my childhood. As I got older, I would excitedly jump from our old Datsun and go tearing in through the front gate, imagining the impressed faces of the judges as they scored the best-dressed house competition.The day itself followed a set routine. The parade was first, and without fail I would be cajoling everyone to make haste down the steep hill from my gran and grandpas house to the main street, my heart thudding in my chest with fear we might miss it.:Susan Swarbrick: Pondering the le lessons of dirty laundryI could already hear the skirl of bagpipes and thump of a bass drum at the far end of the village. Id listen as they steadily grew closer, craning my neck to catch a glimpse of the first float.My gran saved up coppers all year in an old Epsom salt jar, which gave them a dusty sheen that felt gritty and sometimes sticky as I grabbed a handful to throw into the passing collection bucketsAfter the parade, came the park. There would be stalls and races. This was also where you would collect the hallowed gala day box containing a gluttony of treats: a cold pie or sausage roll, a Mars bar, crisps, an iced cake and a plastic carton of juice.Id be allowed to eat one thing because a banquet awaited back at the house, my gran serving up dish after dish, just like she had when in service at a big house in Glasgow many years before.Usually by then the gala day committee would have been round to do the judging and a small piece of card would be proudly taped to the living room window, denoting a placing in the contest for best-dressed house. She even won one year.Rounding off the day was a visit to the shows, where we would eat candy floss, hook a duck, ride the carousel, tear around on the dodgems and take a spin on the waltzers until I was either feeling sick or had run out of pocket money.:Susan Swarbrick: Ill brave the midges this summer ndash our tourism sector needs usThere are no gala days this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, although I hope that, like me, in villages and towns across Scotland, there are others who are fondly reminiscing.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Every single one of our  local authorities has had cases of trafficking or exploitation. In , there were over  cases of people being trafficked or exploited in Scotland. That number looks set to rise this year. And without question there are many more cases that have gone unreported.Modern slavery takes many forms. Its victims are both men and women, adult and child. There are cases of both sexual and labour exploitation. Its victims can be born-and-bred in Scotland, have moved here years ago, or only just arrived. Modern slavery takes place in our cities, towns, villages and countryside. Often, it takes place in plain sight.All over Scotland, there are women trafficked into sexual exploitation, forced into prostitution by traffickers. They work in appalling conditions, at great risk, terrorised and traumatised by their traffickers and the men who pay for sex. Other victims have been found working for illegally low wages ndashthey are paid at all ndash in nail bars, car washes, construction sites, and where.:Behind closed doors, gangrsquos family traded in victimsrsquo miseryThey have their wages withheld, and their lack of English and support networks is exploited. Other victims are locked into dangerous environments to cultivate cannabis plants, used by their exploiters to transport drugs around the country, or forced to beg on our streets.It gets worse. Despite causing dficulties for us all, the coronavirus lockdown is a gt to traffickers. Many victims are being forced by their traffickers to take greater risks than ever. They may be forced to work in conditions without social distancing, or prevented from accessing healthcare, or be compelled to take risks with their health to earn money for their traffickers.And the lockdown has made it harder for us to find those people who need our help: their traffickers have moved them off the streets, and public services are stretched as we deal with the coronavirus crisis.Furthermore, councils are increasingly concerned that the economic impact of the crisis will make even more people vulnerable to exploitation. Thousands of people in Scotland have lost their job, or seen their incomes disappear.Traffickers will be moving in, to prey on the most vulnerable: forcing them to work in unsafe conditions or for illegal wages, or by tricking people into a debt they have to work to pay off, but never can. Furthermore, many migrants in Scotland have lost their job in the crisis. Even those who are entitled to benefits may not know their rights, or how to negotiate our systems of public support, and they may not have developed personal support networks of their own. The risk of exploitation is great.More must be done to protect victims, and potential victims, from modern slavery ndash and we all have a role to play. Scotlandrsquos councils are doing all we can to combat this brutal exploitation taking place in our communities.Guidance developed by Cosla for local authorities was launched by spokesperson Councillor Kelly Parry in , to enable staff to spot the signs that someone has been trafficked and provide them with the critical support they need. We work closely with the police, NHS and other bodies to disrupt traffickers and help victims.:Neil Mackay: Amid covid and racism hellipwe want to build a better world, letrsquos start with police interrogating Prince AndrewCouncils are embedded in our communities, so we are working locally to spot the signs of modern slavery. Tackling this horrendous crime means working in partnership with a range of stakeholders. Councils, schools, the police, border force, charities and community groups all have a critical role to play.And so too do members of the public. Anyone who sees anything that appears to be an emergency should dial . If it is not an emergency, but a cause for concern, dial . If unsure, it is always right to call  rather than not reporting at all. Human trafficking is a hidden crime, which means that the outside signs can be hard to spot. Businesses need to check their supply chains and report suspicious activity. The more information the authorities have, the better the response.There is currently a national debate about the role of slavery in Scotlandrsquos past. We must also remember that modern slavery is part of Scotlandrsquos present. Councils are at the heart of the fight against modern-day slavery, and we will continue to work with other organisations to work hard to ensure it is not part of our future.Councillor Alison Evison is the President of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-neil-mackay-need-offended-era-cancel-culture","story":"Itrsquos lucky I didnrsquot chuck the book out the window because the next day I picked it up, finished it, and realised itrsquos probably one of the greatest works of th century literature. Irsquove read that novel  times. Irsquod be a poorer person ndash emotionally, psychologically, intellectually ndash without having read Brooklyn, and Selbyrsquos other magnicently transgressive works.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Sturgeons economic recovery wonrsquot be about de-growth but jobs, jobs jobsYears ago, I was at a festival for a showing of Funny Games ndash Michael Hanekersquos psychological arthouse horror film. The host said thatanyone in the audience could watch it to the end without hiding their eyes or leaving the cinema, then there was something wrong with them. I snorted. As a connoisseur of shock, I wasnrsquot going to be terrorised by some Austrian indie movie.I was wrong. About half way through, as other audience members fled, I turned my eyes away from the screen so I didnrsquot have to look at what was happening. Years later, Funny Games remains, for me, as raw and powerful an artistic statement about the violence and nihilism inherent in all human beings as Irsquove ever seen. Itrsquos a work of great art which testies directly about the darkness in every soul.So Irsquove spent a lot of my le being shocked and outraged and,it doesnrsquot sound too contradictory, thatrsquos been hugely beneficial to me as a thinking human being. Shock and offence have helped me grow steadily as a person. Shock and offence have allowed me to explore a side of humanity that doesnrsquot ndash thankfully, hopefully ndash exist within me: cruelty, violence, bigotry, hate. Shock and offence have taken me by the hand and shown me what suffering and humiliation really mean ndash when again, thankfully, hopefully, my le has been relatively free from such pain.The world is big people are small. As a journalist, Irsquove wanted to explore as much of this huge world as possible to understand the planet Irsquom living on. As a reader, viewer, theatre goer, art lover, I also want to explore as much of the inner world as possible too ndash in all its glory and awfulness. That means for every Jane Austen, I need a Hubert Selby Jnr.My writing as a novelist is drawn to this exploration of humanityrsquos darkest traits. Why do we do such terrible things  That question cannot be answered without risking some degree of shock, outrage or offence. A work of art which explores transgression or cruelty doesnrsquot by necessity have to outrage in order to truly probe what it means to be human, but it inevitably will outrage some people because of the territory into which it dares tread.I believe to be human we need to accept shock and offence as a necessary part of existence, great art, and personal growth.However, we live in a world where shock and offence are becoming increasingly unacceptable ndash where shock is deemed something to be shunned, banned, silenced hellip cancelled. I can only see this as a diminishment of our shared humanity.Black Lives Matterprotests have rightly shaken the western world. Endemic racism is being confronted and bigotryrsquos days feel numbered. But amid this righteous fury, therersquos been some great foolishness.Gone with the Wind was removed from HBO after complaints over racial stereotyping. Personally, Irsquove always felt the film was quite shocking to my modern eyes. Even as a child its representation of black characters, like Mammy, made me uncomfortable. But does it outrage me so much I want it banned  No. Firstly, I wouldnrsquot ban anything unless its content was illegal. Secondly, Irsquom aware the film was made in . Back then, most white people were racist ndash even nice white people. So the film is of its time ndash that alone makes it culturally noteworthy. It also tells a story set in a much dferent period, with attitudes much dferent to ours: the American Civil War, a battle over slavery and white supremacy.Gone with the Wind is a cultural artefact. It should no more be cancelled than Shakespearersquos The Taming of the Shrew, because of the way women are treated in the play. I donrsquot have the temerity to stand in judgement over previous generations, because I know one day we, the people of , will be judged harshly for our views by generations to come. Irsquom also interested in learning about how those previous generations thought. If I cancel their art, I canrsquot do that.I didnrsquot shed much of a tear when Little Britain was removed from streaming services because of its portrayal of black characters. The show was nasty and sneered at everyone ndash the white working class, ethnic minorities, the disabled. Still, I wouldnrsquot cancel it for its content. I just wouldnrsquot watch it because itrsquos unfunny and embarrassing. In years to come itrsquoll be a cultural artefact like Love Thy Neighbour.However, the line gets blurry when we come to issues like The League of Gentlemen, which was pulled from Netflix because one character wears blackface. Blackface is an obscenity. I cringed at it growing up, on programmes like The Black and White Minstrel Show, which was appalling even in the early s. But The League of Gentleman character in question, Papa Lazarou, is an absurdity not a racial stereotype. Hersquos neither black nor white ndash hersquos some strange alien creature,anything. Viewers know the character isnrsquot a representation of a black person. He doesnrsquot exist in any reality we know. Itrsquos never a good idea to analyse a joke, but the gag isnrsquot about race. Papa Lazarou, like all characters in The League of Gentlemen, is fundamentally surreal ndash therersquos no meaning beyond the urge to make us laugh. Itrsquos Pythonesque silliness with no sinister subtext.And thatrsquos the problem ndash we read subtext today where none is intended. We also seem to have forgotten how to read a joke. UKTV removed The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers. Anyone whorsquos watched it will know that Basil Fawlty is being mocked for xenophobia ndash therersquos no celebration of it. The scene with Fawlty goose-stepping and shouting about the war was shocking when it first appeared ndash primarily because we all knew then that such attitudes still existed, and here they were being sent up in grotesque fashion.If satire is going to work, it must mimic the voice and attitudes of those it wishes to satirise. One can imagine so much of Spitting Image which mercilessly lampooned those in power during the s being seen as too shocking, too offensive, for todayrsquos tastes. So we live in an era almost supine when it comes to satire. Writers self-censor for fear of being cancelled. Thatrsquos not good for art, or society. Nothing hurts the powerful as much as laughter. But today, wersquore hesitant about how we make people laugh in case we give offence, and so the powerful escape the sting of satire.We saw the same issue ndash the same snowballing effect ndash during the height of the MeToo campaign. MeToo rightly declared war on misogyny, sexual harassment and inequality. Like BLM, never was a movement more needed. But like all protest movements these days, there was a small minority ndash but very vocal, particularly on social media ndash who seemed incapable of proportion. And so wersquod the absurdity of men like Matt Damon being spoken of in the same breath as Harvey Weinstein. Damon had said: \"I do believe that therersquos a spectrum of behaviour. And were going to have to figure ndash you know, theres a dference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right  Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldnt be conflated, right Right. But Damon became a figure of hate. Demanding the removal of confederate flags or statues of slave owners is right and just ndash though Irsquod say such objects should be placed in museums to be studied. However, being angry over a monkey on the front of the Coco Pops box undermines the important battles that are being fought. Amid the BLM protests, former Labour MP, Fiona Onasanya, who was jailed for lying to police, tweeted at Kelloggs asking ldquowhy Rice Krispies have three white boys representing the brand and Coco Pops have a monkey .As someone whorsquos pretty much your standard definition of a liberal-leftie, this kind of debate worries me considerably. I fear it opens up the fight against racism, misogyny and homophobia to ridicule. If we allow ourselves to become figures of fun ndash ludicrously unable to weigh matters proportionally ndash we wonrsquot win any arguments. It gives opponents a chance to laugh and say lsquo they think Coco Pops is offensive, why should we take them seriously on anything rsquo. Furthermore, it ides the left. Intelligent, liberal folk are put off and it leads to purity purges. The left turns on itself, when it should focus its concerns on the right, and addressing matters of real inequality.There are many, many right-wing snowflakes out there who scream outrage when their flag, country, monarch, values, traditions, church, or army is mocked. Thatrsquos always been the case. The right is historically the part of the political spectrum which takes most offence.But the left-right ide over shock and offence has changed in recent years. The left has more than caught up with the right. In fact, we appear to have completely lost our sense of humour. The left was once the place to go for a defence of freedom of speech. Now ndash and I struggle to process this political and cultural change ndash itrsquos the right which defends free speech, and the left which attacks the liberty to speak as you feel fit.Alternative comedy flourished in the s by spitting offence straight in the face of Margaret Thatchers government. Today, most alternative comedians would be booed offthey reprised their greatest routines.Bill Hicks woke me up to the truth about Americarsquos role in the world through his comedy. As a teenager, I learned about the USrsquos shady foreign policy dealings through Hicks, long before journalists clued me up. But Hicks was also a shock-machine. His views on pornography or his \"Goat Boy\" routine ndash framed by skits in favour of legalising drugs, and against racism and misogyny ndash would be cancelled in a heartbeat today.Cancel culture has mostly invaded our screens. Itrsquos yet to really make itself felt in literature, on the stage or in the art gallery. So therersquos still safe spaces where those of us who intellectually need a little shock can go.PUNK was about transgression itself. Why do artists seek to push the limits of taste and decency  The answer was simple: in doing so we learn very simply truths about humanity and our fallibility.One of the first exhibits to catch my eye in PUNK was  by Chris Burden. Itrsquos a simple black and white image of the artist shooting at a jumbo jet as it flies overhead, taken in . In our current age of mass terror, the photograph is deeply troubling. Would such an image be shown today  Would either left or right tolerate it :Legal challenge could scupper poundmillion flagship superfast broadband planLater, in the exhibition, therersquos an installation by Christoph Draeger entitled Black September. Its source material is the murder of  Israeli athletes by terrorists at the Munich Olympics in . It features a le-sized hotel room ndash identical to the one in which athletes were held hostage. The room, which yoursquore able to walk through, has been reconstructed asyoursquore looking at it in the aftermath of mass murder. Therersquos blood on the walls, the sheets, the floor.In an era when all of us experience atrocity through TV, Draeger puts us physically into the horror. But today, just four years on, would the Black September installation be cancelled  Would it be seen as offending the memory of the murdered athletes  Would it be accused of exploiting Jewish suffering  Would it be interpreted as riling hate against Muslims All I know is that Black September was one of the most powerful artistic experiences Irsquove ever had. I was a baby when the Munich atrocities happened but I remember the aftermath throughout the s. I knew back then it was a horrible, dreadful crime ndash perpetrated against innocent people for no other reason than they were Jewish. Yet, the Black September installation all but transported me into the lives of those who died. I felt their pain and suffering, I felt their rage at dying because of their race and religion, and I felt huge aching pity and sorrow for what theyrsquod lost and what their loved ones lost. And I felt those things because of the emotional punch this art had dealt me.Therersquos a picture of me in the MACBA inside the Black September installation, taken by my daughter. The photograph shows utter horror on my face. What the photograph doesnrsquot show is whatrsquos going through my mind. The installation shocked me, it outraged me ndash but it had to do that to trigger emotions that would hopefully make me a more empathetic, understanding person. A slightly better,still fundamentally flawed, human being."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-king-lear-mr-munch---bunch","story":"WHEN actors grow older they often decide to play King Lear.

They were more honest times. There used to be a petrol can inside which you could use to fill your car with petrol to get you to the petrol station, and then bring back filled up again.ldquoThe AA man used to salute as you went by, their shoes were always polished and their unorms were very smart.As well as providing a leline for passing motorists, the boxes had a range of uses for locals, he adds.ldquoWomen would used them to get changed in. One chap who liked a flutter was a member of the AA but he didnrsquot have a phone at home. He used to go to the AA box and get the AA man to put on his bet for him.ldquoI think some things that went on in them that are best left unsaid.The motor vehicle was still in its infancy in  when the Automobile Association, formed just seven years earlier, decided to follow the lead of the RAC and provide sentry posts dotted around the country for its patrolmen.While the RACrsquos blue boxes tended to fade into the landscape, the AArsquos black and brilliant yellow boxes would become familiar features of road for generations of motorists.Originally intended as shelters for smartly dressed sentries or patrolmen on bicycles or motorbikes, who were more likely to help motorists with directions or warn of police speed traps than tow stricken vehicles to the nearest garage, boxes soon sprang up across the country.So-called lsquosuperrsquo boxes featured signposts on the roof which were illuminated at night and equipped with fire extinguishers, spare parts and tools to help get cars moving.Some became focal points of rural villages, with features such as mock wells, dovecots and flower gardens arranged around the boxes.But by the early s, the traditional wooden boxes began to disappear in favour of modern, pedestal telephones. Easier to maintain, they offered motorists stuck at the side of a road no protection from the elements.Writer Bernard Bale, who has researched the boxes, said: ldquoThe AA boxes on a main road in the middle of nowhere were a welcoming sight, like the lights of a homely pub on a cold, winters evening.ldquoHaving an AA badge on the grill of your car was like being awarded the OBE. The salute from a passing AA man impressed the kids, the mother-in-law and other passengers and the service on offer from both the AA and RAC was ndash and still is ndash the equivalent in relief of a truck giving you a lt when you are walking across the Sahara desert and still only halfway.ldquoThe boxes outlived their usefulness, time and further progress having made them redundant. The mobile phone rules everything these days and the legendary AA box like so many war survivors are few in number.Scotlandrsquos seven remaining AA boxes are in remote and often picturesque spots.

And demolition teams would mount an assault on red sandstone, bricks, and mortar, along with the tight-knit communities that held families close, their schools, much-loved shops, busy workplaces, and precious parts of Glasgowrsquos heritage.Although not directly a victim of the construction of the Kingston Bridge itself, the Grand Hotel, and a host of buildings in Charing Cross were part of the same audacious plan to revolutionise transport through the city. Standing in the path of progress ndash but not for long - stood swathes of Anderston, Townhead, Cowcaddens and Kinning Park.Some, of course, were rotten with poverty, overcrowded and in dire need of action. Demolition was probably regarded as a blessing.But others, such as the elegant tenements that stood on the southside at Kingston ndash which gave its name to the bridge that would transform travel and the city ndash or at Charing Cross, where link roads would plough through the site of the Grand Hotel, the loss would be mourned for decades to come.By the time the Kingston Bridge was opened by The Queen on  June,  ndash almost exactly  years ago - communities which stood in the way of its ramps, access roads and the cityrsquos new transport map dominated by its inner ring road, were long gone.ldquoGlasgow was almost a testing ground for inner city motorways, says Norry Wilson, the writer and historian whose Lost Glasgow Facebook site and accompanying website documents the changing face of the city. ldquoIt was the scale and sheer destructive nature of it all. Itrsquos interesting that after the Glasgow experience no other inner-city motorway was built like that.Even those whose homes and businesses escaped the hammer, knew change was happening. ldquoEvery day your nostrils would be full of black snotters, the whole city was engulfed in soot because so much was being demolished, he adds.ldquoChildren would go to nursery or school and come home with clothes black because there was so much soot in the air.A new bridge across the Clyde had been proposed as far back as  when the controversial Bruce Report looked to regenerate the post-war city.Ruthless in its outlook, it suggested clearing slums along with a major new roads network that placed some of Glasgowrsquos architectural gems including the Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow City Chambers, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and Central Station in its crosshairs.ldquoThe Bruce Report is remembered for advocating wholesale demolition of the city centre and rebuilding it in some kind of s eastern bloc style, says Stuart Baird, chairperson of Glasgow Motorway Archive.ldquoThere was a lot of austerity after the war, and they couldnrsquot agree on where the development should happen.It took over a decade before an agreement was reached that  inner-city areas should be earmarked for comprehensive redevelopment, paving the way for a pared back version of the Bruce Reportrsquos road plans.While some historic gems were saved, the delivery of Glasgow Inner Ring Road, the M and the Kingston Bridge would see others met their end. Swathes of Townhead were flattened, including Parliamentary Road, which ran from Sauchiehall Street to the East End.And tenements in Cowcaddens, an area blighted by high child mortality rates, slums and low le expectancy, were razed to make way for new concrete corridors. As the new road network crept towards the Clyde, it gobbled up communities which formed when the land was still being farmed and homes were clustered in simple villages.Hardest hit was Anderston.By the late th century it had grown to become a bustling community of weavers, with bleaching, printing and dyeing industries alongside potteries, breweries and once dominated by the  feet high cone of the Verreville Glassworks.Many within its community of around , residents were told to clear out to make way for the Inner Ring Road and bridge plan.Not even Anderston Relief Church in Heddle Place, erected in , nor the arearsquos three cemeteries ndash the one linked to the church, another a Catholic cemetery at St Markrsquos and one more at North Street ndash would dodge the demolition teams.ldquoThere are still horrible folk tales of how old graveyards dating back to the s were removed, with heaps of bones taken away and dumped in unmarked graves in other cemeteries, recalls Norry.Indeed, some ghostly tales still suggest that the bones of the long-departed are remain trapped beneath the bridgersquos foundations, doomed to lie forever beneath the rumble of overhead traffic.There was similar devastation on the southside.ldquoOpposite Kingston Halls on Paisley Road West were once beautul gardens and tenements leading up to Scotland Street School, recalls Norry.ldquoIt was a very populated area, with good working-class communities. These were decent tenements, not slums, but they were swept away along with pubs, schools, and shops. The people were almost cast to the wind, shunted out to places like Easterhouse, East Kilbride and Castlemilk.As work began on the Kingston Bridge, rubble from properties which once stood by the edges of the Clyde poured into its foundations. While at relatively well-to-do Charing Cross, a fashionable and busting junction drew people to its markets, shops and cafes, stylish buildings would also be washed way by a tsunami of demolition and construction.They included properties on North Street and the Grand Hotel, described by Stuart as ldquoprobably the biggest casualty of the Inner Ring Road. Designed by architect James Thomson, it opened in , it had  rooms, a ballroom, a cocktail bar and ninerooms. In its prime, it entertained wedding receptions and lavish assemblies of debutantes and bachelors, and, of course, guests from around the world.Among its most famous was Colonel William Cody ndash Buffalo Bill ndash who strode through its wood and brass revolving doors in December  as guest of honour of the cityrsquos  Club.Lunch consumed, the party retreated to hotelrsquos grand ballroom where Native Americans performed and a cowboy band played. Few would deny that by the s it was a little dated, but nothing a little attention couldnrsquot solve.The irony, adds Norry, is that communities and heritage were sacriced for roads and a bridge in a city where cars were not king for most.ldquoIt was never designed to help the people of Glasgow it was to get people from one side to the other without going through Glasgow.ldquoGlasgow compared with a lot of other British cities has a very low per capita car ownership figure.ldquoWhen you talk to older people about what was lost, they are full of stories and talk of it as a criminal act of destruction, he adds.ldquoYounger people just ask why we ever allowed it to happen."},{"url":null,"title":"loggerheads-lennoxtown-residents-odds-housing-plans","story":"This handsome village, lying  miles to Glasgowrsquos north-east, is surrounded by some of the most charismatic countryside to be found in west central Scotland.Just behind it lie the Campsie Hills and Campsie Glen and on the other side, the bleak beauty of the ancient Lennox Forest. The families who have lived here for generations are fiercely proud of its working-class identity.:Legal challenge could scupper poundmillion flagship superfast broadband planLennoxtown has encountered many of the social iniquities that have harrowed similar small communities across west central Scotland. In recent times itrsquos witnessed the dismantling of a once-thriving industrial base that provided steady, skilled and well-paid employment. Lennox Castle Hospital, the local nail-works and the pulp factory in neighbouring Milton of Campsie have all disappeared and with them the jobs and local businesses they sustained.Its busy main street was once a thrumming commercial hub of local food-shops. One by one they all vanished. Lennoxtown is also in dire need of good affordable housing to relieve a chronic shortage apparent across the whole of East Dunbartonshire. But a proposed small housing development planned for a small, two-hectare site on the eastern approach to the village encapsulates why Scotland still has a persistent shortage of social housing, despite the best efforts of the Scottish Government.The site is home to an unremarkable cluster of largely non-native trees which have grown to an inordinate height. Thus, when you turn into Lennoxtown from its main approach road you are greeted by a small clump of overgrown woodland which blocks out the hills and one of the most magnicent vistas in west central Scotland.Yet, the proposed development has met fierce resistance from residents in adjacent streets. These are part of a larger private housing estate comprising some of the most expensive houses in the area. Ironically, these were built on a large area of woodland which itself had been a much-loved recreational space for local families.Johnny Leslie, a pensions adviser whose family is embedded in this community is angry at the prospect of a much-needed social housing development being obstructed by what he regards as ldquopure nimbyism.ldquoWersquove witnessed the steady disappearance of all our community shops: the butcherrsquos, the bank, the baker the fishmongers. When someone offers to build good, solid, affordable housing, bringing with it the chance to stimulate the community you grab it. Yet I went to a public meeting and it was clear that some people just didnrsquot like the idea of it being built near them.ldquoThis development will also create a signicant number of well-paid skilled jobs for a couple of years. An opportunity such as this would be a real leline to this community.Opponents of the development have cited environmental and bio-ersity concerns. Yoursquore left with the impression that this is some kind of Scottish Serengeti and that Sir David Attenborough might soon be pitching up in the neighbourhood.This, by one resident, reflected many of the concerns: ldquoI believe that mentioned damage to existing woodland, construction work and long-term use of this area will generate signicant increase in localised road traffic and increase in CO emissions.Another said: ldquoThe drawings show that the new development is standing on relatively flat surface. I am assuming that to achieve this, there will be a need to remove signicant amount of the treesand signicant amount of soil. I am assuming that the removal of the trees and soil could consequently affect the hillside stability and its current ability to retain water.An Ecological Impact report by the respected EnviroCentre concluded: ldquoNo statutory designated sites or ancient woodland are present within the site. It added that ldquoone tree located in the south of the site is considered to offer low Potential Roost Features for bats and that ldquoa potential squirrel drey, considered to be that of a grey squirrel, was identied in the south of the site. There was one wood pigeonrsquos nest and that ldquono field evidence of badger, red squirrel, West European hedgehog or brown hare was identied. Yoursquod find more wild animals in a window-box, in a manner of speaking.The council planners have thus far chosen to pursue a blocking strategy, citing concerns about the validity of the consultation and the familiar bio-ersity concerns. Depute Chief Executive, Place, Neighbourhood  Corporate Assets, Thomas Glen, said: ldquoThe planning service has a duty to consider the pre-application consultation carried out by applicants on receiving a major planning application. The national guidance is clear that concerns about pre-application consultation should be raised as early as possible by planning authorities. In this case the planning service raised concerns at a suitably early stage to allow the applicant to recty the situation.The developers though, point to advice from the Council before the application which states: ldquoThe woodland also has limited bioersity value due to the dominance of non-native coners.The Pre-application Consultation Report runs to  pages and was much broader in scope and scale than a four-question Facebook survey organised by the local community council which showed that an incredible % of social media respondents opposed the development. Yet, the developersrsquo survey indicated a clear majority in favour of affordable housing and the increased recreational space envisaged by the development.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Sturgeons economic recovery wonrsquot be about de-growth but jobs, jobs jobsA spokesperson for the developer rejected all objections by opponents: ldquoThe proposed development at has progressed on the basis of advice received from the Planning Department during pre-application discussions. East Dunbartonshire Councilrsquos Planning Department clearly set out the measures expected from the development to ensure a policy compliant application was submitted. It is our opinion that we have exceeded the requirements asked of us, in writing, by East Dunbartonshire Council.Local SNP councillor, Paul Ferretti is also opposed to the development following representations by concerned residents. He said: ldquoHaving attended every Community Council meeting, where this issue was on the agenda, and having received a large volume of correspondence on the issue, I would disagree with the premise that the reason why nearby residents are up in arms is due to the potential of social housing being on the site. Their concerns have centred on bioersity, the height of the flats, loss of woodland, access roads etc.The Herald though, has an audio-recording of a conversation between the architects and a senior council planner in which the official is clearly heard to suggest thatthe affordable housing element were to be removed it might have a chance of proceeding. A nearby resident vocerously opposed to the development suggested to the architects that perhaps ldquosome bungalows would be acceptable, an idea which would feature in a subsequent email exchange. In  Shelter Scotland reported that there had been , homeless applications during the previous  months and that , households were assessed as homeless by their local authority. This equates to a household losing their home every . minutes.

In a joint letter published last Wednesday , parliamentarians from  European countries expressed their ldquoserious concern about the plan. More than  of the signatories are legislators in Britain, according to the BBC, which on its website said the Israeli embassy in London had declined to comment.ldquoWe are deeply worried about the precedent this would set for international relations at large, the letter stated, adding that ldquoacquisition of territory by force has no place in , while warning of the ldquocommensurate consequences such a move could spark.The letter, part of a wider global expression of concern, was initiated by four other prominent Israeli figures, including Avraham Burg, a former Speaker of the Knesset, and Michael Ben-Yair, a former Attorney General of Israel.Adding to the international appeal for Israel to think again about the plans, the United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres reiterated the UNrsquos own message ldquothat annexation would be not only against international law but it would be a major factor to destabilise the region.Speaking ahead of a high-level UN security council meeting on Wednesday on the Middle East, Guterres said annexation ldquowould undermine what I believe is necessary, which is a two-state solution in which Israelis and the Palestinians can live together in peace, respect each other, and guarantee each otherrsquos security.ldquoI hope that this voice of reason that is not only mine ndash it is echoing across the world ndash will be heard by the Israeli authorities and that annexation does not take place on July , the secretary general added.For their part, Palestinian officials have threatened to abolish bilateral agreements with Israelprime minister Benjamin Netanyahu goes ahead with the annexation.Senior Palestinian Authorityofficial Hussein al-Sheikh told The New York Times that the PA was ldquonot a charity and would not stand idly by while Israel undermined its authority in the West Bank.His comments chimed with those of PA leader president Mahmoud Abbas who in a speech before the Arab Parliament, the legislative body of the Arab League, said thatIsrael went forward it would be forced to carry ldquothe responsibilities of an occupier on the civilian population.ldquoSuch an illegitimate measure will oblige Israel to assume the responsibilities of occupying power in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention, said Abbas.The wording of the Convention that Abbas referenced is very clear, stating its objective to protect any person ldquowho, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals.In this case that occupying power would, of course, be Israel. Other Palestinian officials were quick also to stress how the annexation moves could cause an uptick in violence. Nabil Abu Rudeina, an aide to Abbas, warned of the dangers of retaliation for such a move, saying ldquothere will be no security and stability without giving the Palestinian people their rights.Perhaps, more predictably, the armed wing of the Gaza Striprsquos ruling Hamas group said annexation would be considered ldquoa declaration of war on our people.ldquoWe will make the enemy bite at its fingers with regret for this decision, a Hamas spokesman said in a video message.It was following a power-sharing deal that led to the formation of the current Israeli government last month that allowed annexation to be put to a vote from July .In seeking to extend Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank containing Jewish settlements, Netanyahu earlier won the backing of President Donald Trumprsquos administration in January.Trumprsquos version of his so-called ldquoPeace to Prosperity plan allows Israel to keep up to % of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, as well as all existing Jewish settlements, which most of the world considers illegal.Flying in the face of previous US foreign policy, Trump has also slashed aid to Palestinians, severed diplomatic ties and declared all of the city of Jerusalem Israelrsquos capital, despite Palestinian claims over part of the city.Netanyahursquos annexation plans have also been given added urgency because of the impending US presidential election in November. Trumprsquos potential departure from the White House could scupper what Netanyahu and his supporters see as a ldquohistoric opportunity to extend Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, evenwidely deplored as a violation of an international treaty forbidding annexation of occupied land.With the clock ticking down to a US election, Netanyahu might be encouraged to move quickly this week given that Trump is the only US president to have endorsed annexation and there are no guarantees Joe Biden would do the same were he to replace the incumbent leader in Novemberrsquos presidential ballot.Today, more than , Jewish settlers live inside the West Bank, while another , others live in East Jerusalem. Alongside them are some three million Palestinians who see the West Bank as the heart of their future state.

Should it go wrong, at least the birds will appreciate itAlong with Egypt, Jordan is the only Arab nation to have signed a peace treaty with Israel. But opinion polls in the Kingdom have consistently shown that Jordanians overwhelmingly oppose the  treaty that was signed one year after the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians.Jordan would be ldquoforced to review all aspects of our relations with Israel, prime minister Omar al-Razzaz told French news agency AFP recently. The report also cited ordinary Jordanians as saying that Israelrsquos proposed move poses an ldquoexistential threat for a country where more than half of the  million population are of Palestinian origin.As tension with Jordan grows, Israeli media reported that Yossi Cohen, chief of Israelrsquos external security service Mossad, visited Jordan and met with King Abdullah. For some time there have been suggestions that there are those within the Israeli political and military hierarchy who have been uneasy about taking unilateral steps on annexation that could influence the future of ties with Amman.Reports suggest that Cohen was apparently sent to Jordan directly by Netanyahu and while few details have emerged, the aim of the visit, say some observers, was likely an attempt to reassure the Jordanian monarch.Such uneasiness is not confined to Israelrsquos neighbours, with reports in The Times of Israel that the countryrsquos own security chiefs appear to be at loggerheads over the potential fallout from the annexation moves.According to Israelrsquos Channel  news last Thursday and cited by newspaper The Times of Israel, the heads of the Israel Defence Forces , Shin Betand Mossadtook part in a meeting of the high-level security cabinet last week during which ministers had distinctly dfering views on the possible ramications of West Bank annexation.Quoting unnamed ministers present at the meeting, the network said IDF chief of staff Aviv Kohavi and military intelligence commander Tamir Hayman warned annexation could spark violent unrest in the West Bank, including shooting attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers.The military chiefs and their Mossad counterparts were also said to be ldquoat odds on whether the move will be met with signicant Palestinian violence or not. Yossi Cohen was said to be dismissive of IDF concerns and predictions of a violent response by Palestinians.ldquoI donrsquot accept the claim that annexation will necessary lead to violent responses, Cohen was quoted as saying in the meeting.According to Channel , two ministers were also reported as admitting that they had not seen such a sharp disagreement between the security services for some time.ldquoThere seems to be no homogeneity in thinking, intelligence or insights, Channel  cited them as saying.Some observers suggest that such dferences of opinion at both a military and diplomatic level appear to be compounded by the continuing uncertainty over precisely what Netanyahursquos next move might entail next week or beyond.For the Israeli leader a clear green light from Washington is a prerequisite for the start of any annexation process and the signs are that the White House remains cautious.ldquoThere is as yet no final decision on the next steps for implementing the Trump plan, one of the US officials told Reuters news agency on Thursday, referring to the presidentrsquos Israeli-Palestinian blueprint that could provide a basis for Netanyahursquos next move.Among the main options under US consideration is a gradual process in which Israel would initially declare sovereignty over several settlements close to Jerusalem instead of the % of the West Bank envisaged in Netanyahursquos original plan, a source close to the matter is said to have told Reuters.The uncertainty has left many senior Israeli diplomats in something of a quandary.A few days ago, Bloomberg international news agency, citing an Israeli foreign ministry official who asked for anonymity in discussing internal affairs, described how it had ldquoput the nationrsquos representatives in the uncomfortable position of having to fend off allies peppering them with requests for information. A ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the remarks the Bloomberg agency also confirmed.As this weekendrsquos edition of The Economist observed, for the moment July  is less a deadline than a starting point over annexation. The Israeli leader continues to play his cards close to his chest.The magazine also reported that on June , Israeli security officials held war-game manoeuvres in preparation for possible violence, but remained unclear about their own governmentrsquos intentions.ldquoAnnexation  What annexation  the magazine quoted an Israeli diplomat as asking.Even with just days to go, Netanyahursquos government still hasnrsquot spelled out in public, or apparently in private, what it intends to do.On the one hand, Netanyahu could decide to annex large swathes of territory or annex nothing at all. Then again, as many observers now believe, he will most likely do something in between.ldquoWersquore sort of haphazardly leaping into this, said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security adviser and member of the Commanders for Israelrsquos Security group, which opposes the move.ldquoThis isnrsquot the way you go about one of the most important and consequential decisions in Israelrsquos history, Freilich told Bloomberg in an interview as the clock continues to tick down towards July .:Legal challenge could scupper poundmillion flagship superfast broadband planThere remains, of course, the unlikely possibility that Netanyahu might reconsider his annexation plans. This would not only go down badly with his supporters but also do little to change the reality on the ground for Israelis and Palestinian alike, say Middle East watchers.Be it European parliamentarians, diplomats, those Democrats in America who oppose annexation, or ordinary Israelis and Palestinians, there is much apprehension over how events will unfold in the coming days and weeks.ldquoIsrael is about to make one of the most fateful decisions in its modern history ndash a decision that will have a profound impact on its future as a Jewish democratic state and on the prospect for peace, observed Tzipi Livni in her Washington Post opinion piece last week, underlining the seriousness of what is at stake.Palestinians likewise are under no illusions over what it means for their community.

Doubtless this will also more or less replicate what Downing Street has decided, though using cosmetically dferent language and a slightly alternative timeline.And Ms Sturgeon claims shes above politics these days.Martin Redfern, Melrose.ROBERT McNeils articles are always highly enjoyable, and he is bang on the money with his comments regarding Boris Johnson splurging pound, of public money on repainting a plane . To do such a thing in these dficult days with businesses struggling due to lockdown and many people facing economic hardship is not just \"plane daft\" and an expensive and insensitive waste of public money, it suggests that Mr Johnson is up in the clouds when it comes to making sensible decisions, and one can only wonder what role his top political adviser and co-pilot Dominic Cummings played in this flight of fancy. Was it for advice like this that the Prime Minister stubbornly clung to Mr Cummings in the teeth of the publics disgust Mr Johnson needs to be brought back to earth with a bump, and face being grounded, permanently.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Keep an open mind on climate changeNEIL Rothnieobviously doesnt know that there are many theories on what makes the climate change, so I will enlighten him.He knows of the warming theory involving man-made greenhouse gases. The late Stephen Schneider was a leading proponent of this in  he announced to the world his concern for the build-up of CO in the atmosphere. Incidentally, pre- he was warning the world of a looming global cooling crisis, but all of his cooling work has been deleted.Many alternative theories on climate have been announced. In  Henrik Svensmark published his first paper on the link between cosmic rays and climate. In  Nicola Scafetta announced his research suggesting that most climate change is due to the influence of planetary motion on the sun, and William Gray suggested ocean currents. In  James Kamis suggested that mantle plumes and plate tectonics drove the climate, and in  Arthur Viterito suggested vulcanology.Many scientists have claimed that changes in the earths magnetic field are the dominant driving force on climate, or that simply nobody really knows.I respectfully suggest that Mr Rothnie be more open-minded.Geoff Moore, Alness.NEIL Rothnie may be genuine in his beliefs that mankind can save the planet by giving up fossil fuels His contempt for the North Sea oil industry is puzzling, since without it the UK would have been held to ransom by foreign nations. The UK has a miniscule . per cent of global emissions, Scotland .%, but ChinaIndiaand numerous other countries are still building coal-fired plants to drive their economies using cheap fossil-generated electricity, not mega-expensive wind electricity.Mr Rothnie mentions climate chaos but he, and others who believe the computer climate modelling forecasts, will be upset to learn that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has, once again, stated that there is little basis for claiming that droughts, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes have increased, much less increased due to greenhouse gases.Ever since climate scientists realised that there was a comfortable living to be made out of the threat of global warming there have been many hundreds of scary predictions, all of which failed to come to fruition.Will Mr Rothnie vow not to own, use or travel in any products which were derived from fossil fuels Clark Cross, Linlithgow.Why statues need to be removed\"MY name is Ozymandias, king of kings: look on my works, ye Mighty and despair!rsquoThus wrote Shelley in a poem subverting the vanity of power embodied in a statue.I would generally support the views expressed by Professor Wardle in his letterand the article by Kevin Mc Kennawhere Sir Tom Devine makes his arguments for a deeper scrutiny of Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade. Their views on the latter cannot be seriously contested.What is a statue  It is surely, amongst other things, an attempt to transcend time and space. These petried representatives of horror that fill our public spaces are not merely signicant in their materiality, they are also important as figurative projections of power, rank and prestige propelled from the past into the present. The intention behind them was that they were to be honoured and acknowledged as emblems of a dominant class who took their barbarous rule as a natural right. More importantly, they help underpin that same domination today.Any statue is both a presence and an absence. All statues fill a space and, simultaneously, obscure and conceal. I would argue that the removal of these monstrosities would help reveal the more authentic history desired by Prof Wardle and Sir Tom.Finally,we are to fully examine Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, we should endeavour to avoid clumsy conflations. The Scottish millworker and the Scottish crewman did not \"benefit\" from slavery. They were part of a dynamic of capitalist accumulation in which they had little say and little power. They led miserable lives characterised by long hours, disease and premature death. If Sir Tom wishes to insist they did benefit then he should at least employ some form of calibration and dferentiation. The slave owner and the merchant stole the lives of the slave and the wage slave.Alex Porter, Stirling.BEING a naturalised Scot of mixed West Indian British heritage, I have a concern that the more admirable aspects of the Black Lives Matter campaign are being ruined by a very sinister development.\"Taking the Knee\", originally a brave and meaningful gesture by black American sportsmen and equality campaigners, later adopted by supporters of all races, has been devalued by the way the media are using it.Singling out any public figure who is not an enthusiastic \"knee taker\" for opprobrium, effectively makes the act compulsory for anyone who does not want to risk their reputation, their job, or harassment by a large and angry segment of society.Many non-believers living in extremely strict religious communities will attend or comply with the requirements of that religion in order to fit in and avoid persecution ndash even though they live otherwise blameless and good lives. Compulsory gestures of solidarity or belief have no real value to any cause as they make it impossible to judge the true extent of \"belief\". Obligatory worship or participation in religious ritual by non-believers cannot be of any value to the Deity concerned.Neither politicians nor anyone  should be questioned or criticised about their non-participation in someone rsquos gestures or rituals. Instead, judge them by what they are actively doing in le to make things better now and in the future.Mark Openhsaw, Aberdeen.Degrees of stupidityI AGREE entirely with Priscilla Douglasrsquos rebuttal of Iain Macwhirterrsquos conflation of education and intelligence .Some years ago, I worked for a public service organisation whose basic entry requirements were numeracy, literacy and physical fitness. Practicality and common sense were advantageous, too. News came that one of our bases was to receive a recruit who had been educated to a high degree . After he had completed his basic training and been sent to his base, I met his supervisor and asked him how his recruit was doing.\"You mean Three Degrees \" he asked, rhetorically. \"He could tell you the square root of a jar o jam, but he couldnae open the lid!\"Dougie McNicol, Bridge of Weir."},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-pm-pushes-back-fitness-doubts","story":"ldquoI donrsquot really want to be a glum bucket, said Andrew Marr, echoing a prime ministerial turn of phrase, ldquobut folks, it ainrsquot so.Despite the best efforts of the Scot and Sophy Ridge, his counterpart on Sky News, there was a slight ldquoend of term air abroad. For that, blame prime ministerial push-ups. Mr Johnsonrsquos determination to prove to a Sunday paper that he was fit for purpose had led to the bizarre sight of the Prime Minister hitting the deck and giving the reporter hellip well, it was not specied how many push-ups he had done.First sign of a tone being set was BBC Breakfast host Chris Mason telling viewers that Marr was ldquolimbering up for his show.Marr, turning to the photo on the front of the Mail on Sunday, said: ldquoThis is the Prime Minister, adding ldquowe are told, asit was possible a body double was used.Then there was the PMrsquos description of himself as ldquofit as a butcherrsquos dog. That was deemed worth chewing over in the paper review, with Marr asking BBC correspondent Hugh Pym, ldquoas a health specialist what the phrase meant.ldquoWe were just speculating about that earlier, whether it meant the dog was fit because it would run around the butcherrsquos shop looking for scraps, or actually eating a lot of meat which probably isnrsquot exactly the message to get across to remain fit, said Pym.Normal, serious business was resumed when the shows turned to the sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey as Shadow Education Secretary for retweeting an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.: Iain Macwhirter on FMs economic recovery plansThe dismissal, which has sparked criticism on the partyrsquos left, took up almost the whole of Marrrsquos interview with Ed Miliband, Shadow Business Secretary.Mr Miliband said Ms Long-Bailey was a ldquovery decent person and he did not believe she was anti-Semitic, but the party leader was right to have acted as he did. This was not about a ldquopurge of the left, he insisted. ldquoHersquos not about purges, I know the guy, he said of Sir Keir.Marr ended on a lighter note by asking the former Labour leader a ldquoslightly mean question.Miliband was almost Tiggerish in his response. ldquoGosh yes, go on, yoursquove asked me many mean questions over the years.If ever there was a politician who looks liberated from the bonds of leadership it is Mr Miliband. Between how he got the job ndash by taking on his own brother ndash to his struggles with bacon sarnies, the MP for Doncaster North did not have his troubles to seek as HM Leader of the Opposition.ldquoYoursquove seen Keir Starmer now in operation for a few months, said Marr. ldquoIs he going to be a better leader of the Labour Party than you There was not a secondrsquos hesitancy. ldquoDefinitely. I think yoursquove seen that already. Look, I certainly never had his approval ratings.The Minister for the Sunday shows was Priti Patel. With the rapid easing of the lockdown in England, and scenes of disturbances at illegal gatherings, it was her job to figuratively read the riot act. ldquoWe can enjoy ourselves in a very responsible way, said Ms Patel.The usual pre-BBC pop-in to Ridge on Sunday yielded a story when Ms Patel was asked about those Labour MPs who had accused her of using her own experiences of racism to ldquogaslight the ldquovery real racism faced by black people in the UK.Ridge askedsome people had a particular problem with Ms Patel as ldquoa BAME woman who was a Conservative.Ms Patel said: ldquoThey clearly take the position that I donrsquot conform to their preconceived idea or stereotypical view of what an ethnic minority woman should stand for and represent. In my view, that in itself is racist.Marr, in true Columbo-style, had one last question for the Minister. Was she going abroad on holiday in the summer  ldquoIrsquoll be working hard throughout the summer, said Ms Patel.: Scientist warns UK on kne edgeEarlier, Joanna Lumley appeared on Marr to plug a special performance of Waiting for Godot in aid of entertainment charities.ldquoAndrew, yoursquore going to be coming to sit on my lap, said the former star of Ab Fab and The New Avengers.ldquoWe werenrsquot to tell people that, Joanna, said Marr.She was treated to the holiday question too. If ever Marr fancies yet another job he would fit right in as a hairdresser. FYI, Ms Lumley is going to France with her husband.And what of the push-up king  Where might the PM be going on holiday  There was a perhaps a clue when he told the Mail on Sunday that some of the best holidays he had had were in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Devon, adding ldquoWhy go anywhere  That festive break in a luxury villa in the Caribbean, his last holiday, had clearly not lived up to expectations.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households.

These include play areas within school grounds and the skate park in Kirkwall.From that date, the play area at the Pickaquoy Centre will be open, but the rest of the complex and surrounding grounds will remain closed.Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC’s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “I am very pleased that the gradual easing of lockdown allows us to reopen play areas throughout Orkney.“I am sure this will be welcomed by many children, young people and their families, especially as the summer holidays are fast approaching.“In line with Government requirements, we strongly advise that everyone follows hand hygiene and physical distancing guidance when visiting play areas. That will help ensure all of us stay safe.”The latest advice on this can be found here: https:www.nhsinform.scot illnesses-and-conditions infections-and-poisoning coronavirus-covid- coronavirus-covid--physical-distancingcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PARKING-FAIRY-POOLS-4.jpg","title":"letters mothball tourism until vaccine praise for responsible","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOn a purely local, Highland level, with Test, Track and Trace in place, there is much to commend that view.There is also a view widely supported that the Tourist Industry should be restarted.I use the phrase Test, Track and Trace because it closely illustrates what must be done.I asked VisitScotland how many tourists they expected this summer in the Highlands. They had absolutely no idea.What we can surmise is that to anyone where in the UK this looks like a great, safe, destination.It doesn’t really matter because one infected person, , could result in  being infected  days later, and, unchecked, every three days after that the number of infections doubles.If you were on a family holiday and you had very mild symptoms, would you report them, or think you had a summer cold Let us be absolutely clear that the only reason this “R” number is where it is, is because we have all been kept in our homes to stop the virus spreading.The virus is still out there.The stated defence, in fact the only defence, , against that happening is Test, Track and Trace.How do you Test, Track and Trace an itinerant population of “let’s say”  to  tourists who move their location pretty much every day I think inviting an unrestricted number of visitors to the fragile Highland communities is a huge risk.Don’t think I don’t understand the economic consequences. My we and I run a very well-regarded BB taking people from all over the world.This year we will have none.Most BBs are not going to go bust, the owners are living in their own homes.Not so with hotels. So, we need a dferent answer anyway, because the chances are the hotels are not going to make up the number of bed-nights they need to survive in the next three or four months.Both the businesses and their staff need protection.Liquidators and Receivers should be instructed, by Government, to close the business downto stop the ebb of money, and either protect them from creditors, or much better pay the creditors with Government sponsored bank loans, keeping a close record of that expenditure. Perhaps they could also pay the staff They should mothball the business waiting for the day a vaccine or a cure is found, and it can re-open safely, and be handed back to the previous owners. The owners would then be given favourable, very long-term loans to pay back the costs met by the liquidators and receivers.There will be a cost, but a cost the owners can later meet, over many years, at low or virtually zero interest rates. The Government should not foot that bill, but it could facilitate it.I do not for one micro second forget the massive and fantastic contributions to health and care workers, and those on the front line who delivered to our doors at this time.However, my respect and admiration goes to the owners and staff of tourist and hospitality businesses.The financial and mental strains needing to remain optimistic, to remain as responsible employers and to face the financial crisis that this pandemic has brought, needs some recognition.I am sure the cost to trade and business may never truly be known, but must exceed millions of pounds.To those who kept us all safe, by cancelling visitors and closing shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions at this testing time, simple words of thanks are not in any compensation for the vast loss in revenue from the sector.But I would just like to thank all those ethical and responsible businesses that did the right thing, and helping to decrease the possibility of the spread of this virus.The sacrices of owners and staff will not be forgotten, and I would urge all local people to rally round and support these businesses when it is safe to do so.Tourism and hospitality is the mainstay and leblood of our local economy, and with everyone#s help, in time it will recover.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bbc-salisbury.jpg","title":"timely salisbury series showed ordinary people doing the best in an unprecedented","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMy kids seemed to have survived this oversight in their upbringing although in high school it apparently caused some surprise among their pals.I should add it is not all books by candlelight.

The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions. While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

While I missed my family and friends and others who have played a signicant part in my le, I am glad that they could watch from afar via the live-stream.The service began with a welcome and call to worship by the Moderator of Down Presbytery, Rev Dario Leal, minister of First Ballynahinch Presbyterian.During the service, which included three pre-recorded items of worship by members Second Saintfield, Brian McKee a representative elder to the Presbytery from First Ballynahinch, read from  Timothy :-.The sermon, based on the reading from First Timothy, was delivered by the Rev David Hyndman, minister of Magherahamlet and Spa Presbyterian Churches, who convened the Second Saintfield vacancy.Those present for the service and others watching online from over  separate locations also heard short pre-recorded speeches after the service had concluded.One was a message of welcome from Stanley McFarland, Clerk of Session of Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church.The Presbytery Moderator described the installation and ordination service as ldquodferent, but a special evening.He added: ldquoJohn received and accepted a call from Second Saintfield on the Monday before lockdown. While it was frustrating for all concerned that his ordination and installation could not take place in Saintfield due to the restrictions in place, we were delighted and relieved when the offer came from the PCIrsquos General Secretary inviting us to use Assembly Buildings.ldquoIt now means that John can commence his ministry for which he trained and has been called to.

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\"
