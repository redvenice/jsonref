It was perhaps ironic, therefore, that when Theresa May promoted Patel to run that department – with responsibility for spending millions in foreign aid – she swiftly overcame her objections.The National Audit Office later said money was being wasted by her department’s ‘rush’ to hit the 0.7 per cent target.On capital punishment, too, she dramatically changed her position. MPs had challenged Patel repeatedly on the question of whether British aid money should go to countries that still execute people.

Critics accused her of seeking to run her own freelance foreign policy team in the Middle East.On her return, she demanded her own department change its aid guidelines to give money to the Israeli army so it could carry out humanitarian work in the disputed Golan Heights.In Westminster there was disbelief that she had barged into an area that was rightfully the Foreign Secretary’s.

He will guarantee the rights of 3.2million EU nationals living here. Speaking directly to EU leaders in Brussels and Dublin he says he is ‘convinced we can do a deal’ but without the ‘anti-democratic backstop’.Leaving without a deal was a ‘remote possibility’ and would only happen if Brussels ‘refuses any further to negotiate’. Preparations for leaving will ‘accelerate’ from day one, and while he acknowledges there ‘will be difficulties’ he argues that ‘with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed’.ANALYSIS: By avoiding directly attacking the EU, Mr Johnson wants to suggest how reasonable he is. In truth he is the iron first inside the velvet glove – making a plea for Brexit peace, but only on his terms. Yes, he wants a deal, but not Mrs May’s – the EU has to move. And if it doesn’t, he argues, No Deal will be its fault, not his.Preparing for No Deal is not a wild gambit but simply ‘common sense’. Britain will be ready, and will have the £39billion Brexit bill for ‘lubrication’.Fix social care\u0027My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care.

Policing, the NHS and schools all got a mention. As well as 20,000 more officers, Mr Johnson promised to end three-week waits to see a GP, deliver hospital upgrades and send more money to primary and secondary schools to ‘make sure your kids get a superb education’.‘My job is to serve you, the people,’ he said, ‘because if there is one point we politicians need to remember it is that the people are our bosses.’ANALYSIS: A subtle shift in tone from leader of the nation to servant of the people, and with it a pledge to address four issues that have the potential to damage the Tories with swing voters.As Theresa May found to her cost, there are few issues that resonate as much with voters of all generations as the injustice of the social care system. Combating rising crime and improving the NHS and school funding are essential to deprive Labour of ‘austerity’ ammunition if there’s an election around the corner.         European Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel BarnierProtect the union\u0027The awesome foursome that are incarnated in the red white and blue flag.\u0027Wrapping himself in the Union Flag, Mr Johnson promises to be PM for the ‘whole United Kingdom’, unite the country and stand up for British values.But he also wants to unify the country economically by helping the ‘left-behind towns’ and ‘answering the plea of the forgotten people’ in areas outside London and the South East.He will ‘close the opportunity gap’ and give ‘millions of young people the chance to own their own homes’.ANALYSIS: With clear echoes of his message during the Leave campaign, Mr Johnson is reaching out to voters who feel they aren’t among the winners in Britain today, and promising to act as their champion.He is also urgently seeking to neutralise a potent criticism of his Brexit policy: That No Deal could lead to the break-up of the Union as the SNP agitates for a new independence referendum.Embrace the future\u0027After three years of unfounded self-doubt it is time to change the record, to recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward looking, and truly global Britain.\u0027         Photovoltaics with wind turbines generating electricity in power station (stock)Rattling off a list of areas in which Britain is a world leader, he hails the strength of the British economy in ‘life sciences, tech, academia, music, the arts, culture and financial services’.He points to gene therapy used to treat blindness and battery technology to combat climate change, and he pledges to embrace the opportunities of the ‘post-Brexit future’ by doing free-trade deals, changing tax rules to encourage investment, embracing space technology and – more controversially – scrapping EU rules that limit the use of GM foods.ANALYSIS: In this final section, Mr Johnson promises to work ‘flat out’ to ‘give this country the leadership it deserves’ and paints a picture of the ways Britain will improve once Brexit is out of the way. After three years of ‘unfounded self-doubt’ it is time to ‘change the record’ and ‘recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain’.He is pointing to the glorious future that awaits as long as MPs don’t stand in the way, or in the event of an election, if MPs give him a thumping mandate to lead.          "},{"url":null,"title":"Those gloriously groan inducing dad jokes really make laugh new study shows","story":"Share this article Which Spice Girl can carry the most petrol?

In January Boeing’s executives said the Max was the fastest selling plane in its history and the company expected to deliver between 895 and 905 airplanes this year.Now it has become the most costly plane in Boeing’s history.Boeing has predicted that the Max will be flying again by the end of the year, but this month the Wall Street Journal reported that government and industry officials believe a return date of January 2020 is more likely.On a call with analysts Muilenburg said the company may have to consider slowing or halting production if there are further delays in getting the plane back into the skies.Boeing is still producing 42 of its 737 jets a month and plans to boost that rate to 57 next year. But if there are further setbacks, Muilenberg said: “We might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options including a temporary shutdown of the Max production.”Muilenberg added that Boeing expected to submit its “final certification package” to the Federal Aviation Administration, the US regulator, in September.Last week Boeing said it would take a $5.6bn charge to cover potential compensation to customers. The company also expects the cost of manufacturing the 737 to rise by $2.7bn due to production slowdowns. A $100m fund is being established to compensate the families and communities affected by the crashes.“This is a defining moment for Boeing and we remain focused on our enduring values of safety, quality, and integrity in all that we do, as we work to safely return the 737 Max to service,” Muilenburg, said in a statement.“During these challenging times, teams across our enterprise continue to perform at a high level while delivering on commitments and capturing new opportunities driven by strong, long-term fundamentals.”The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp e into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane\u0027s black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFlight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.Regulators across the world continue to investigate the fatal crashes of a Lion Air Max in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in Ethiopia that claimed a total of 346 lives.Investigations have centered on the plane’s Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) flight control software, which was designed to keep the aircraft stable in flight. In both crashes the pilots appear to have fought in vain to keep the plane’s nose up as the system, triggered by flawed sensor readings, dragged it down. Boeing executives subsequently tried to share some of the blame with the pilots.Last week a father who lost five family members in the Ethiopian disaster accused the company of “utter prejudice and disrespect” and said Boeing had pursued higher a higher share price and profits “at the expense of the safety of human life”.The grounding of the 737 Max has had wider consequences for the US aerospace industry. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines all used the Max and have canceled flights into November as a result of the grounding, depressing revenues. Ryanair, another major customer and Europe’s largest short-haul airline, has said late deliveries of the 737 Max will force it to cut routes and shut bases as it curbs expansion plans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a46f58692d2fae1f8f2130fe8024f3e32b99a8/0_273_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4efd580866062c949ce987630705e8db","title":"caledonian sleeper staff vote strike action stress","story":"RMT union says workers have been ‘paying personal price’ for introduction of new fleetCaledonian Sleeper staff have voted for strike action, claiming “intolerable” and “appalling” working conditions after the botched rollout of its £150m fleet of sleek trains.The new generation of overnight sleeper trains, billed as a hotel on wheels, have been plagued by problems since being unveiled in April.The RMT union said morale has sunk to an “all-time low”, with staff suffering from workplace stress and mental health issues.Issues raised in the dispute with Serco, which has run the Caledonian Sleeper franchise between London and Scotland since 2015, include insufficient staffing levels, lack of training and an “unresponsive” management regime.“Our members on the Caledonian Sleeper are sick and tired of paying the personal price for the botched introduction of the new fleet,” said Mick Cash, the general secretary at the RMT. “That is why they have delivered this overwhelming vote for action.”The vote also includes the option of taking industrial action short of a strike.The upgraded trains, which were partly funded by the Scottish government, feature double beds and en suite bathrooms and were heralded as giving a luxury overnight journey for passengers, with a double en suite priced from £400.However, on a disastrous first night in April, north and southbound trains rolled in hours late, beset with problems including signalling glitches, a delayed driver and onboard calamity ning accommodation mix-ups and catering blunders to leaking cabins.Since then, technical faults with the trains have led to a number of overnight services being cancelled or curtailed, leaving passengers stranded until morning. The Caledonian Sleeper’s punctuality is the worst of any UK train operator.The company has delayed new trains that were set to be rolled out on the scenic Highlands routes to Fort William and Inverness until after summer.Ryan Flaherty, Serco’s managing director for Caledonian Sleeper, said: “We’re deeply disappointed by the result of the ballot. I believe we have shown a real commitment to dealing with the issues the RMT has raised and indeed there was an acceptance on all sides that progress was being made.“We remain open and willing to engage in further talks to avoid industrial action and are fully committed to delivering the best possible service to guests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2628db4eb4ea525ab81176f6d8ec3a4e1a433ee4/0_50_8099_4859/master/8099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef11a0f8d2960c73acde582e74739742","title":"hideous and naff are londons new water fountains too ugly","story":"The design of London’s new drinking fountains has been criticised on social media – so which cities have managed to get it right?Last week, the locations of 50 new public drinking water fountains in London were announced. The scheme, a joint venture between Thames Water and the mayor of London which will install 100 in total, aims to encourage people to use refillable water bottles, and cut the consumption of single-use plastics.But while the initiative was welcomed by many, the design of the fountains – a white base with a large blue waterdrop on top – came under fire on social media. The structures have been designed to be easy to spot and able to withstand all weathers. But one Twitter user branded them “naff”, another “hideous” – and historian and broadcaster Tom Dyckhoff tweeted: “Great idea. But these are the UGLIEST things ever designed by humans.”Damning comparisons were made with elegant, ornate, Victorian-era water fountains:However, while historical fountains look impressive, there are practical problems with restoring them, pointed out Jon Burke, cabinet member for energy, waste, transport and public realm at the London Borough of Hackney. He replied: “As part of Hackney’s new water fountain programme we’re bringing historical fountains back into use, but they cost three times to fix (let alone designbuild) than a new one the Victorian ones are often not disability compliant and we’ve lost £130myr from the Gov’t ...”Several years ago, a design challenge in London asked six architecture firms for proposals for new fountains.

All liberally seasoned with fish sauce. And accompanied by gargantuan quantities of wine.The Roman love affair with food and drink is explored in a major exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, opening on Thursday. Titled Last Supper in Pompeii, the show includes about 300 objects loaned by Naples and Pompeii, many of which have never left Italy before.For Paul Roberts, the exhibition’s curator, staging the exhibition is the fulfilment of a dream he has had since 1976, when he first visited Pompeii with his mum. “I was bowled over by the real life because I’d thought of Romans as gladiators, emperors and people who were in my Latin books and then suddenly in Pompeii, there were real people.”What better way, said Roberts, for us to connect with the ancient Romans as ordinary people than through food and drink?The exhibition includes actual food carbonised by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79. It shows what the inhabitants of Pompeii ate and drank, why enjoying it was so important, and how they made their meals.For example, the short but sweet life of the dormouse is highlighted by the display of a large terracotta jar, a glirarium, in which dormice were deposited and encouraged to get fat as if for hibernation. They were fed acorns and chestnuts through holes in the side.Roberts has placed a stuffed toy dormouse at the top of the jar to show how fat they got and that they were not as tiny and spindly as modern visitors might imagine. Nearby are kitchen utensils that would have been used to cook them.They were evidently delicious, and consumed in vast numbers. “I’ve not had one myself,” said Roberts. “But friends have and apparently they taste like a cross between rabbit and chicken.”The show includes star objects from collections in Italy, including a startling mosaic of a grinning skeleton that decorated a dining room floor in the House of the Vestals. It is literally death at the feast.Roberts said it was a masterpiece. “It reminds you while you’re dining that this is the epitome of life, friends, family, business acquaintances.”Fortunately the skeleton is carrying wine jugs in each hand, indicating that there will at least be wine in the afterlife. It’s main message though is, Roberts said, “that you’ve got to seize the day … carpe diem.”• Last Supper in Pompeii is at the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, Oxford, 25 July-12 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e097333d11a9060b36fd5f696b286df43181dae/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc239826e57ee5c6d1fafd2d59c23d8","title":"the smell the noise the dust my neighbour the factory farm","story":"Industrial farms are spreading across Europe. Greenpeace campaigners went to talk to the people who live close byWarning: readers may find one of the images below upsettingWhat is life like for people living next door to an industrial-scale livestock farm, and how does it affect their daily lives? Greenpeace campaigners visited animal farms and their surrounding communities in France, Denmark, Spain and Italy between December 2018 and March 2019 to find out.There are more than 330m cows, sheep and pigs in the EU, with a further several billion chickens reared and slaughtered every year. The growth of Europe’s animal farming sector has seen it exceed what scientists have claimed are safe bounds for greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient flows and bioersity loss. This has lead to calls from campaign groups for a halving of meat and dairy production by 2050.Ricardo Antón (below) is known as Ritxi by his neighbours. The 56-year-old runs an organic horticulture farm in Caparroso, Navarre, in northern Spain, which caters for small clients, including two school canteens.“All these big factory farms represent a threat to the ecosystem in the area,” he says. “Also, smaller enterprises can hardly sustain their production.” He says traditional farms – small-scale operations with a ersity of crops and livestock – are disappearing.The owners of the farm plan to build the EU’s biggest dairy factory farm, with more than 23,000 cows in Noviercas, a village of less than 200 inhabitants in Soria, Castilla y León. This new farm was rejected in the regions of Navarre, País Vasco and Cantabria, but the owners have the support of the mayor in Noviercas.Former high school teacher Bente Jørgensen has lived in the village of Tingerup, about 60km west of Copenhagen, with her husband Søren Hansen, a chemical engineer, for more than 20 years. Her home is just 100 metres away from the Vandvaerksgaarden pig farm.Jørgensen says the couple are afraid of being exposed to possible toxic substances, through manure and air. When the smell is strong, Jørgensen wears a face mask outside. “The smell is so awful that it makes me feel sick. My head aches and my eyes are red and swollen. I feel that our lives are destroyed because of the smell, noise and dust from the farm,” she says.Jørgensen enjoys being outside, but she limits her time outdoors because the smell coming from the farm is so bad and she fears the long-term health impacts of her exposure to it. She has to clean her garden fence several times every year because of algae growth, which she believes is fuelled by nitrogen from farm ammonia emissions. Every Thursday, dead pigs are being collected from the farms in the area. Until collection day the neighbours say they often see dead pigs outside the farms. Under Danish law, pigs should be covered and not visible.The primary school in the village of Lescout is located just 500 metres from the egg-laying hen farm of Gallès SAS. First built in the 1980s, it steadily grew and after expanding in 2016 it now keeps 185,000 hens, outnumbering the population of the village more than 250 times over. The owner is planning further expansion after requesting a permit for a new building.“During some mornings, the smell was so corrosive in the throat and nose that for the sake of children’s safety, we preferred to keep them indoors during playtime,” says Cathy Double, a former teaching assistant at the school.The farm is also close to Château du Gua, a historic castle belonging to 57-year-old architect Catherine Gavelle. “I think this type of factory farm should have never been constructed in the first place. There should not be the authorisation to construct an industrial building alongside a village and next to a listed building. This factory farm has affected my life with its visual, its noise and its smell,” she says.Adalgisa Martorelli (below), aged 55, lives in the small village of Cadelbosco, in the Emilia-Romagna region, and suffers from a respiratory illness that, she says, worsens in the presence of strong smell. She has repeatedly been forced to leave her home during manure-spreading by two local pig farms, Azienda Agricola Fontanelle SNC di Ferrari e C and Allevamento Azienda Agricola Tenuta Vincenzo Srl. She has undergone several hospitalisations and sometimes has to use an oxygen mask at home.There is no medical evidence of a link between her illness and farm pollution, but Martorelli says her condition has improved since the second farm stopped spreading manure on the field near her home.Ten years ago, Martorelli created a small local committee together with other inhabitants of the village, which documented sewage spills from the first farm, Azienda Agricola Fontanelle SNC di Ferrari e C, into local waterways. The farm was forced by the local authorities to suspend the spreading of the manure for five years in part of neighbouring fields and reduce the number of pigs on the farm – from 12,500 to 3,899.The farm owners told the  that the alleged sewage spills were due to pipe breaks and a very rare occurrence. They said the reduction of pig numbers was unconnected to the sewage spills, but due to the complaints of the Clean Air Committee. They also said they had been monitoring emissions from the farm, which they claim are below Italian and European averages for pig herds.The second pig farm – owned by Azienda Agricola Tenuta Vincenzo Srl – has been granted permission to expand from 2,000 to 7,000 pigs. Martorelli’s committee is opposing this enlargement. “I’m terrified about the new request for enlargement. If this will be really done, I will probably not be able to live here any longer. I will have to decide to leave my home,” she says.The farm owner Dario Gualini told the  that it had received environmental permissions for the expansion and would be monitoring its impact. “We have adopted the best techniques in the field of animal welfare and the protection from smell and environmental pollution. We are convinced, as the authorities that issued the permits, that our structure will be taken as an example in the future for the best conditions for both animals and humans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6967e6cd6884185efdcd36714fe6526dc711565/31_142_2210_1326/master/2210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb217b2429686c846b420e35f0199a1f","title":"powerful undersea images photographer roger grace in pictures","story":"The marine biologist, conservationist and specialist underwater photographer Roger Grace died at his New Zealand home in June.

So why-yi-yi-yi now?When Sandy told Danny to “Tell me about it stud,” in skin-tight black trousers and a leather jacket in the 1978 film Grease, little did Olivia Newton-John realise her character’s costume would go on to fetch a combined estimate of $230,000 (£185,000) at auction more than 40 years later.These items of cinema history, along with 200 more of the actor’s costumes and personal clothes will go under the hammer at Julien’s Auctions in LA in November, with 32 highlights now on display at the Museum of Style Icons in Ireland.“The trousers and jacket are the most identifiable of pieces and what people remember when they think of Olivia Newton-John,” says Martin Nolan, the executive director of Julien’s Auctions, who is organising the exhibition.The pink lace gown and matching stole that she wore to the LA premiere of Grease is expected to get $8,000. She still remembers the energy emanating from the crowd when she and Travolta stepped out of their car. “I remember thinking: ‘Wow! How do all these people even know about this film?’”The auction is, more than anything, a celebration of Newton-John’s 55-year career. Born in the UK in 1948, she moved to Australia with her family when she was five. By the time she was 15, Newton-John was on TV in a girl band. But her career took off in the 1970s, when she came back to Britain with hits including Take Me Home, Country Roads. In 1974, she was Britain’s entrant to the Eurovision song contest with Long Live Love – and came fourth the winners that year were a then unknown four-piece Swedish pop group called Abba. The album of the same name propelled Newton-John into the US, with I Honestly Love You becoming her first No 1 there and earning her two Grammys. She has since sold an estimated 100m records worldwide, a trajectory that is sartorially documented in the auction.A pair of white and gold lamé shorts and matching top, which she wore to promote her Physical album in 1981, are up for $4,000 and a beaded blue chiffon minidress she wore for her first world tour, Totally Hot, in 1978 is estimated to reach $2,000.Much of the proceeds from the sale will go to the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness \u0026amp Research Centre in Melbourne, established in 2015. Set within the Austin Health hospital campus, the centre offers holistic and traditional treatments, as well as education, training and research, and has more than 200 ongoing clinical trials. Newton-John has been diagnosed with her third bout of breast cancer, which has spread to her lower back, and she is still recovering from last year’s cancer-induced fractured pelvis. The remainder of the funds she may donate elsewhere and a portion she will keep, as, she says: “It’s my career.”Newton-John is keeping certain items “that have personal meaning to me”, she says, citing jewellery and items from her late parents or sister – as well as her four Grammy awards, “because they are the height of my success and the most important one I can receive for singing and the music, so I can give them to my daughter.”The auction is likely to break records, but Newton-John remains self-effacing – and eerily similar to her on-screen character of Sandy. She keeps her multiple awards, from Billboards to People’s Choice, in storage, as “it would be funny to have them all over the house”, and doesn’t watch herself on screen.Yet she remains proud of a career that has seen her rock’n’roll with Travolta, jam with Stevie Wonder in an LA club, skit with Wonder Woman and tap dance with Gene Kelly in the 1980 musical fantasy Xanadu.“It was incredible to dance with Gene Kelly and John Travolta in one lifetime … I did the original Dancing with the Stars!” she laughs. “I feel lucky.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61ba762ea960f30743514ffee54f529856b67579/135_2_1506_903/master/1506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=828ebdb6cee5390e4aac85f014660d01","title":"rupert graves interview roman horrible histories","story":"Costume dramas cast him as a floppy-fringed dreamboat – even though he wasn’t actually posh. Now Rupert Graves has gone from top of the fops to playing a rapping RomanRupert Graves’s eldest son got a nasty shock recently when he went on a school trip to see the 1987 Merchant Ivory adaptation of EM Forster’s gay love story Maurice. “He didn’t know I was in it,” the actor says over a morning cappuccino in a north London brasserie. “He went, ‘Argh! No way!’ and ran out.” He actually fled the cinema? “Yeah. ‘I can’t watch my dad naked on screen in front of all my mates. Can’t do it.’” He might also wish to steer clear of A Room with a View, which his father made with the same team two years earlier — his film debut, in fact — and in which he is seen throwing off his clothes to cavort in the lake and scamper through the undergrowth. “He’s not prudish. But seeing your dad naked is a lot for a lad to take.”Some people would be positively thrilled at the prospect of a naked Rupert Graves: his devoted fans, the GravesDiggers, for example, or Mark Gatiss, screenwriter and star of Sherlock, in which Graves plays Inspector Lestrade. “I’ve had a crush on Rupert Graves since I was 14,” Gatiss admitted in 2014, then added: “Who hasn’t?” Graves, 56, who is today wearing round-framed glasses and a bedhead of salt-and-pepper hair, keeps his kit on in his new film, Horrible Histories the Movie: Rotten Romans, a big-screen version of the popular CBBC franchise which comes on like Monty Python Jr. He plays a centurion whose unexpected pauses keep wrong-footing his underlings. Thinking he is telling them to attack, they gather up their weapons in preparation, when what he has really said, if they’d only waited, is: “‘We attack!’ … would be the words of a rash man.” There’s nothing here to embarrass any of Graves’s five children, give or take the rap he delivers on horseback (sample line: “I’ve got 99 problems but a bridge ain’t one”).He shrugs when I ask what the secret is to playing comedy. “I haven’t really done any. It’s stylised reality, isn’t it? Picking out bits and exaggerating them. But it’s got to be true.” Of course, he’s been funny in films before. He was superb as the lodger romantically involved with his landlady and her daughter in Intimate Relations. There was that bit, I remind him, where he wanted to accuse Julie Walters’s character of being a hypocrite but he couldn’t think of the word so he ended up shouting: “You’re a hippo!” He smiles back at me blankly. He doesn’t remember it. And last year he was in Swimming With Men, a kind of underwater Full Monty. “Yeah but I wasn’t playing an insane centurion doing a rap,” he laughs. “OK, I was an insane guy with a nose-clip on doing synchronised swimming, but it’s not quite the same.”If there has been any pigeonholing, it came at the start of his career, when his performances in those Merchant Ivory films, as well as in two by Charles Sturridge, Where Angels Fear to Tread (Forster again) and A Handful of Dust (Waugh), encouraged misconceptions about his background. His name only sealed the deal. “Do you know what? Genuinely, it helps in this business being called Rupert. I’ve sniffed that attitude in acting: the Oxbridge thing. Making movies isn’t a cheap exercise. You need money and the knock-on from that is the industry is populated by a lot of posh people. It’s very hard to break into if you’re not middle class and privately educated.” Or if you don’t have a name that suggests you are. But if being called Rupert boosted his chances, it was a blight on his early years. “I hated it as a kid. I really wished I was called Pete.” Were there any significant Petes in his life? “Only Peter Purves on Blue Peter. Rupert is a ridiculous name in 1970s Weston-super-Mare. Ridiculous! It’s like being called Basil.”Graves speaks in short bursts and clipped sentences as though he’s slightly out of breath, but he is at his most fluid when conjuring up the landscape of his youth. “It was one of these strange and dying seaside towns where the package holiday had killed off most of the trade, so the hotels had to lower their prices. It was the end of a line. A decaying, Thatcherite, druggy sort of place with no investment and no hope. I was always being chased by skinheads. It had some peculiar qualities, being by the sea and near Cheddar, some beautiful land. And it was blasted by the weather, which comes up the Bristol Channel and thumps Weston first. As a kid, it was great to hide behind the buildings as waves would smack them. The weather was physical and exciting. It gave the town character.”At school, he was dreadfully shy and suffered from a stammer, but was also an incorrigible show-off. “I was hyper. My shyness meant I overcompensated, just to get anything out of my mouth at all. I had to summon up so much courage to even speak and then I got carried away because I’d mustered all that energy.” He went to a speech therapist to overcome the stammer and it was she who spotted his acting potential. Turns with the local operatic society followed he also performed at the end of the pier, miming to songs and delivering Victorian comic monologues. What did he get out of it? “The warmth of the approval.” He found himself an agent from the back of the Stage (“I don’t even think we met”) and took on bits and bobs of TV work while still at school, including his turn as a prefect — his first toff — in the spy series Return of the Saint.He adored working with James Ivory. “He would say things like, ‘Put your pipe in upside down.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Because it’s funny.’ He was right. It was funny. In a Magritte sort of way.” But people started cooling on the costume-drama craze at the end of the 1980s. “There was a backlash. I thought, ‘This is really unfair!’ I didn’t go to any fucking posh schools and I was getting lumped in with that.” The director Alan Parker famously derided the Merchant Ivory output as “the Laura Ashley school of film-making.” Graves scoffs. “That was horrible. Really stupid. Forster was actually trying to say something.”But he was looking for a new direction around that time anyway. “The whole industry thought I was Posh Rupert and I wasn’t. I didn’t know people who lived in Fulham and Chelsea, I didn’t know what they thought or what they ate for breakfast.” He reacted by taking on parts which were worlds away from parasols and linen trousers. The most notable was Open Fire, a 1994 TV film written and directed by Paul Greengrass, in which Graves was ferocious and banshee-like, all nails and hair and heels, as the real-life cross-dressing criminal David Martin. He also played a laddish motorcycle courier reunited with a transgender school pal in Different for Girls. It was theatre that really excited him, though, and still does. “You don’t tend to get typecast in theatre.” He was in Torch Song Trilogy with Anthony Sher, the Broadway run of Patrick Marber’s Closer, Pinter’s The Caretaker with Michael Gambon. When I ask whether there is any screen work that he would like people to catch up with, he says: “I can think of plays.” But they’re gone. “Argh! I know. That’s the beauty of it. And the pain.”He thinks he could have been a bigger star if he’d worked at that side of things. “I’m just not ambitious in a career-building way. I’m not good at being polite to the right people. I’m not strategically engaged.” He can’t think when he last did something that would count as networking. “People do it. But I never did. I find it a bit grubby. I can see the benefits. I’ve been lucky that I can keep afloat and not be either too hassled on the street or have to do any of the business side of things, which I’m shit at.” Afloat is an understatement: he has excelled in some of Sally Wainwright’s best work (as a dodgy barrister in the first series of Scott \u0026amp Bailey and as Derek Jacobi’s long-lost son in the third Last Tango in Halifax), and appeared on stage in the acclaimed season of Pinter’s short plays at the start of this year. He will soon be seen as Mr Weston in a starry new film of Jane Austen’s Emma, alongside Anya Taylor-Joy, Johnny Flynn, Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart.Throughout our conversation, he has been charming company while also giving the impression of a runner on the starting blocks, poised to scarper the second he hears the pistol. Once we’ve wrapped up, he rises to his feet quickly and knocks a knife off the table, catching it before it hits the floor. “That’s the thing about getting old,” he says, returning the cutlery to its place. “I’ve become a dropper. I’m always dropping things.” Is he a forgetter yet? “Oh yeah. But I’ve always been a forgetter. Never remember names. Not even in scripts.” And there I was expecting you to recall a line of dialogue from nearly 25 years ago, I say. He laughs and makes a noise I’ve never heard before — “Nyyyyyyr! Nyyyyyyr!” — and then — on your marks, get set — he’s gone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e974da635a3e438281f1326a159d43a6b19261/0_108_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e8695573fe5cbd64b989a47ac45fe9","title":"rutger hauer from blade runner to buffy the vampire slayer in pictures","story":"The Dutch actor, who has died aged 75, had a long career playing – mostly – villains and ne’er-do-wells, but his charisma and force was always apparent•Peter Bradshaw on Rutger Hauer: an icily elegant presence with a touch of self-aware drollery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb96b15c9a578ae82e424e4678a15f4243507df9/0_954_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ac8007b807e4759c7a0c32199b38d9","title":"20 best tomato recipes part 3 kitty travers sorbet jose pizarro sardines","story":"Tomato and white peach sorbet, roast tomatoes and lentils and the ultimate Greek salad – the best ways to enjoy this abundant seasonal ingredientTomatoes are one of the hero ingredients in Greek cooking.

Be careful not to go too far, they burn very easily. Tip them on to a plate to cool a little, then crush them in a mortar to a coarsely ground mixture.Put the sesame seeds into the dry frying pan with the nigella and toast until the sesame seeds are golden. Follow with the sunflower seeds. Roughly crush all the toasted seeds and add to the nuts. Toast the coriander seeds until they smell toasted, then grind them very roughly. Do the same with the peppercorns, then the cumin seeds. Combine the nuts, seeds and toasted spices with the paprika and salt. Store in a jar or other airtight container until you need it.For the tomatoes, preheat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5. Lay the tomatoes in a single layer in a roasting tin. Mix the olive oil and harissa together and pour over. Turn to coat, ending cut side up, then sprinkle with sugar and season. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until caramelised in parts and slightly shrunken.Meanwhile, cook the lentils. Heat the oil in a saucepan and gently sauté the onion, celery and garlic until soft but not coloured. Add the lentils and turn them over in the oil. Chuck in the thyme and bay leaf. Pour on 700ml water, season lightly, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the lentils are just tender. This could take 15-25 minutes depending on their age, so watch them they can turn to mush quickly. When they are cooked, they should have absorbed all the liquid (simply drain them if they haven’t). Remove the thyme and bay leaf. Add the lemon juice. Mix the vinegar and extra virgin oil together and stir it into the lentils with the coriander. Taste for seasoning.Cook the eggs in boiling water for 6 minutes. They should still be a little runny in the middle. Rinse them in cold water and, once cool enough to handle, quickly peel. Roll them lightly in the dukkah and set each on top of a serving of lentils and tomatoes, or if you prefer to see the yolk, break the egg in half and sprinkle some dukkah on top.

The dish is originally from Cordoba, where in August the temperature can easily reach 42C. Here, I serve it with smoked sardines, as we did at my restaurant Pizarro, but you could add fruit such as melon or grapes to make it even fresher, if you prefer.Serves 6sardines 12 small or 6 large, gutted and bones removedmild-flavoured wood chips or sawdust a handful rosemary 2 sprigs lavender 2 heads fruit vinegar 1 tbsp (raspberry, muscatel or apple are good) sea salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the salmorejoreally ripe tomatoes 800g, cored and roughly choppedstale bread 200g (ciabatta, bread roll, rustic loaf), torngarlic 2 cloves, crushedsherry vinegar 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil 75mlFor the lemon thyme croutonsstale bread 100g, cubedolive oil for fryinglemon thyme 3-4 sprigs To serveeggs 3 free-range extra virgin olive oil for drizzlingFirst, clean the sardines. Wash well, then remove the heads, slit the bellies and take out the insides. Then, with a sharp knife and fingers, pull out the bones. This will leave you with butterflied fillets. Alternatively, you can ask your fishmonger to do this for you. Lay the fish on a board, skin-side up, and allow the skin to dry out a little while you prepare the rest of the dish.To make the salmorejo, put the tomatoes in a blender with the bread, garlic, vinegar and olive oil. Season well and blitz, adding a little cold water to loosen. Season again to taste and chill in the fridge.Cook the eggs in boiling water for 6-7 minutes, then cool under cold water.To make the croutons, fry the bread in olive oil with the lemon thyme until golden and crisp. Sprinkle with sea salt and drain on kitchen paper.Line a wok with foil and scatter with a few wood chips and the herbs. Press a wire rack over the top of the wood chips in the wok, ensuring it fits inside snugly. Place the fish skinside down on the rack, then cover the top with a lid or more foil, to stop the smoke from escaping. Place over a medium heat and, as soon as plumes of smoke have started to appear, smoke for 10-15 minutes, until cooked through. Sprinkle with the fruit vinegar.Peel and slice the eggs. Pour the soup into wide bowls and top with the croutons, egg slices, smoked sardine fillets and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.From Andalusia: Recipes from Seville and beyond by Jose Pizarro (Hardie Grant, £26) When I finally got around to planting my own tomatoes I managed to cram in 70 seedlings between my own 4m allotment plot and the neighbour’s raised bed. Needless to say, the end result was half a mountain of unripened fruit once the growing season was over. Unripe green tomatoes are available at the end of the tomato growing season and are often cheaper than the ripe varieties.This is a family recipe that I’ve adapted to add some depth and get the best out of the tomatoes. I use a mixture of sugars including dark muscovado which gives a richer flavour. To save time (plus I prefer my mix to be fine), I pulse the tomatoes, onions and apples in a processor beforehand.It’s a chutney that goes with everything omelette, curries or with a wedge of cheese and sourdough.Makes approximately 2.5kggreen tomatoes 1.8kg, roughly choppedcooking apples 1.8kg, peeled, cored and roughly chopped onions 450g, peeled and finely chopped garlic 2 cloves, crushed (optional)Place the green tomatoes, apples and onions in a large pan with the garlic (if using), sultanas and salt. Tie together the pickling spice, ginger and chilli in a muslin bag and add to the pan. Add half the malt vinegar and gently bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for an hour or until the fruit is reduced to a pulp and the mixture is thick.Gently dissolve the sugar in the remaining vinegar then add to the chutney. Simmer for a further 1½ hours, stirring often until the mixture is thick.Remove and discard the muslin bag with the spices and while the chutney is still hot, spoon into sterilised jars. Seal with airtight, vinegar-proof covers.Caroline McGivern is the Observer Magazine’s deputy art directorOne of the greatest pleasures I know is to eat along with the characters from books and on TV shows. In one of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House books there’s a passage I always found incredible: on a hot day Laura’s ma slices up a ripe tomato, and serves it covered with cream and sugar – to be eaten like a peach!I mulled over the idea of a tomato ice-cream for years (tomatoes are actually fruits, so it ought to make sense) before finally getting a chance to test it out using a real old-fashioned hand-cranked machine on a ranch I was teaching at in Colorado. Hand-cranked ice-cream machines are fun and although the tomato ice-cream looked delicious – creamy and candy-pink – no one could swallow the stuff it was too weird. I put the difference in taste down to the fact that Laura Ingalls and family were too far from peaches, and had come close to starving in previous years due to drought and crop failure. And we were very far from starving. Also, I suppose tastes change.Instead, I’ve settled upon this simple and refreshing recipe, unusual rather than flat-out weird, and very lovely. It produces an elegant, shell-pink sorbet with soft sweetness from the tomato and fruitiness from the white peach.Makes approximately 1 litresugar 130g water 130ml white peaches 3, or 4 flat white peachesripe tomatoes 2 (San Marzano are particularly flavoursome)To prepare the sorbet: heat the sugar and water together in a pan to make a simple syrup, stirring to dissolve the grains of sugar. As soon as the syrup starts to simmer remove it from the heat. Set aside to cool and then chill in the fridge until needed.Rinse the tomatoes and peaches, slice them into a bowl, cover with the cool simple syrup and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, giving it time to really draw the flavour out of the tomato and peach skins.Remove the macerated fruits from the fridge and liquidise them for 2 minutes until very smooth. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or chinois, discarding the skin and pips.To make the sorbet: pour the shell-pink purée into an ice cream machine and churn according to the machine’s instructions, usually about 20-25 minutes, till frozen and thick and creamy looking. If you don’t have an ice-cream machine, freeze the mixture in a big bowl. Every 45 minutes, take it out and whisk or beat vigorously. Do this three or four times, until smooth and uniformly frozenTransfer the sorbet to a suitable lidded container. Top with a piece of waxed paper to limit exposure to air, cover and freeze until ready to serve.

Dried chillies and salty, fermented shrimp paste feature in all the recipes I try, and fresh ginger (or galangal), garlic and onion or shallot are also very common. I find, like the dried shrimp that Sylvia Tan, the cook responsible for my first laksa, uses in her book Singapore Heritage Food, the dried chillies benefit from soaking first it makes them easier to blend into the paste. Tan’s is also the only recipe to use candlenuts, so-named for their high oil content, which give her gravy a lovely, nutty richness. They’re hard to get hold of in this country, possibly because they’re mildly toxic when raw, but macadamias make a good substitute.Where the recipes erge, however, is in their use of dried spices. Malaysian chef Norman Musa uses sweeter aromatics such as star anise and cinnamon along with the coriander seeds and turmeric found in Tan’s version, as well as that from Mandy Yin, the Kuala-Lumpur-born chef at my favourite laksa joint, north London’s Sambal Shiok. In fact, Musa uses the most spices of all, also adding cumin, black peppercorns and cardamom to the paste – his laksa is delicious, more savoury and complex to my and my testers’ minds than some of the others, but doesn’t quite hit the classic, comfortingly creamy notes we like so much in Yin’s. For a less rich take, however, I’d highly recommend it.Two potential shortcuts: Mandy Lee of the website Lady and Pups uses ready-mixed curry powder instead of the dry spices, which may save you shopping, if not a great deal of time, while Olive magazine has a quick recipe using ready-made laksa paste, whizzed up with extra garlic, ginger and chilli powder, which does save a considerable amount of the latter. We all find the one I use a bit bland, but this could be adjusted to taste.Frying the paste is an important step if you’re not to end up with a raw-tasting gravy Yin recommends half an hour of patient stirring until it’s really dark, but it dries out under my inexpert care – half that time seems to yield a pretty decent result.Because this is a seafood dish, I don’t think you need to add chicken stock to the broth, unless you want it to be very meaty indeed – in which case, you could do as Lee does and poach a chicken leg in it, then serve the sliced meat on top. It’s simpler, and more appropriate here, to make a prawn stock by adding their shells to plain water, along with some lemongrass for freshness and Yin’s laksa leaves, all of which can be strained out before serving. Laksa leaves are hard to come by unless you have a south-east Asian grocers nearby (ask for hot or Vietnamese mint), so if you can’t find them, do as Yin suggests, and use mint and coriander instead.The strained prawn stock can be diluted with coconut milk to make the gravy (I wouldn’t recommend the light version I try in the Olive recipe: it’s quite thin and bland. If you’re after health food, a fishy assam laksa is probably a better bet, and seasoned according to whim: Yin, Musa and Tan all add sugar as well as salt and pepper, but taste it and see what works for you. You can also add tamarind at this point, if you’d like to make it sourer as well as saltier and sweeter, but I prefer to serve it with fresh lime on the side, not least because it’s easier.One excellent tip from Lee: strain the paste through a fine sieve before diluting it not only is this the easiest way to remove the shells and stalks, but unless you have the most powerful food processor in the world, it gives a much silkier texture to the finished dish.I’m surprised that there is no one standard noodle used for laksa: egg noodles, rice sticks, vermicelli and glass noodles all feature in the recipes I try. All have their fans, but my favourites are the rice sticks and glass noodles, both of which provide a chewier counterpoint to the rich, coconutty broth than soft egg noodles or delicate vermicelli. But use whichever you prefer.Lee says the only two mandatory toppings are prawns, which are “important for flavouring the broth”, and tofu, “to suck it up”. You’ll need to get big prawns for this, unless you do better than me at finding smaller raw ones with their shells still on, and I’d shell them and blanch the meat separately, rather than simmering them whole for half an hour as some recipes do – it makes them very tough and woolly. That said, because I don’t think these big prawns have a great deal of flavour however they’re cooked, I like Lee’s idea of turning them into shrimp meatballs that might sound a faff, but they take only a minute to make, and they’re exponentially more delicious. Tofu-wise, if you can find tofu puffs (and this shouldn’t be hard – they’re fairly standard in south-east Asian supermarkets), they’re the best choice here, because, as Lee says, they soak up the gravy like a delicious sponge.Otherwise, you can add an almost infinite array of things to laksa: blanched vegetables such as beansprouts, runner beans or sugar snap peas supply a pleasing crunch, while testers particularly liked the cool contrast of Olive’s shredded cucumber. Extra protein, such as Tan’s cockles or Lee’s chicken and her spicy pork sauce, is also a possibility a boiled egg, of course, would be the simplest option.Curry laksa is such a rich dish that I like to serve fresh chilli, pounded with a little salt, as in Tan’s recipe, as well as fresh lime wedges and a handful of coriander or laksa leaves. Oh, and a napkin to tuck into your collar. Turmeric is a devil to wash out.8 large raw, shell-on prawns4 tbsp neutral oil1 litre water2 lemongrass stalks, lightly crushed50g laksa leaves (hot mint), or a mix of coriander and mint, plus extra to serve400ml coconut milkSugar, salt and pepper, to taste8 cubes deep-fried tofu (shop-bought is fine)¼ cucumber, deseeded and finely shredded200g wide flat dried rice noodles or vermicelliFor the paste10 dried chillies, soaked30g dried shrimp, soaked75g ginger, peeled6 garlic cloves, peeled4 small Asian shallots (about 50g), peeled30g shrimp paste2 tbsp ground coriander1 tbsp ground turmeric5 macadamia nutsFor the prawn balls (optional)100g pork mince2 tbsp cornflour1 tsp fish sauce¼ tsp white pepperTo serve4 red bird’s eye chillies, chopped1 lime, cut into wedgesSoak the chillies and dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes, then drain.

Beat in the water, then add the lemongrass and laksa leaves, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and leave the broth to simmer gently for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, if you’re making the prawn balls, put the prawn meat in a food processor with all the remaining prawn ball ingredients and whizz to a chunky paste (otherwise, keep the prawns whole and add to the broth for the last minute of cooking). Form the prawn mixture into eight balls wet your hands first, to make it easier to handle.Pass the prawn stock through a fine sieve to remove the solids, squeezing out as much liquid as possible, then return the broth to the pan. Whisk in the coconut milk, return to a boil, then stir in the tofu puffs and prawn balls, and simmer gently for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then ide between four bowls.Pound the fresh bird’s eye chillies with a little coarse salt to make a coarse paste. Check the broth for seasoning, then pour it all over the noodles. Top with the tofu and prawn balls (or whole prawns), shredded cucumber and a little fresh coriander.Serve with the fresh chilli paste and lime wedges on the side.• Curry, nyonya or laksa lemak – whatever you call it, how do you like yours, and where makes the best?

But don’t reach for a Magnum, they are for childrenYou know all those wonderful things a heatwave will do to a landscape? Obliterating flaws, flattening tedium, idealising the quotidian with sudden contrasts? Well, it does the opposite to food. You are not hungry anyway, so that doesn’t help. Almost all meat starts to look sweaty and botulistic. Salami is the worst, its fat sweating while its edges crinkle. Salads look limp, fish looks dicey even chips become daunting.Everything smells different in the heat things that should be appetising are a bit nauseating, and that’s even without the soapy sunscreen upper lip. Only flies actively enjoy eating in the heat. So, what should you have, just to stay upright? Don’t say a Magnum. Young people are obsessed with them, but this is not a legitimate adult food.You can solve a lot of those texture problems by concentrating on soup, which also saves on having to chew. Gazpacho remains the ace in the hole of the cold soup it is not unusual in a hot climate to put some ice in it, although I dispute that – on purity grounds – as trenchantly as I would putting ice in a glass of white wine. The go-to recipe always used to be the one in Almodóvar’s movie Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown – tomatoes, bread, garlic, barbiturates etc – minus the drugs. Or with them, if you’re really suffering in this heat. This very newspaper, in 2007, published the recipe of Elena Meneses de Orozco, the wife of the Spanish ambassador, and nobody with any sense has made it any other way since. It is subtle, delicate, weirdly intense and surprisingly quenching.Originally, gazpacho didn’t feature tomatoes: just water, bread, vinegar and garlic, like a person trying to make a meal just from the cruets on the table of a taverna. Anyway, don’t worry about that – it sounds disgusting. Add a ton of very ripe tomatoes, a red or a green pepper, some cucumber and cumin and you have an actual meal. If you want the sensation of ice but, like me, despise it, freeze some grapes and drop them in. Chez Bruce, the restaurant that was good before any other English restaurants were, does a green gazpacho that is a lot more cucumber-heavy, with peeled (although not frozen) grapes at the bottom. I am not wild about fruit in savoury food, but I found the effort endearing. That’s what you appreciate in food: the taking of infinite pains.Other cold soups to consider: pea and mint – I wouldn’t normally endorse a cold pea soup, given how delicious it is hot with ham, but somehow the mint makes the temperature OK, because it reminds you of a drink. Vichyssoise, that thick soup made of boiled and pureed leeks, onions, potatoes, cream and chicken stock, is better cold than hot, but you have a stodge problem. Potatoes sit surprisingly heavy. My mother has a vast repertoire of nut soups – almond with harissa, walnut … they are magnificently expensive to make and unbelievably disgusting to eat. Never do this.Still in the category of cold things, very cold melon is the staple of hot climates. If you keep a watermelon very cold, your cat can sit on it until you eat it (see Twitter). And, if you chill a honeydew, you are allowed to drink port with it, for some unknowable reason or other.The old saw about eating hot food and drinking hot drinks in a heatwave has some truth in it, although for different reasons. Very spicy foods don’t cool you down, but they give you confidence because of your gut sense that the chilli has antibacterial andor preservative qualities, which is true. Hot drinks cool you down by making you sweat, so even a cup of tea will do. But it is pointless sweating unless it can evaporate, so if you are somewhere hot and humid, don’t bother, nor if you have too many clothes on, nor even if you’re already sweating so much that it’s just dripping off you. Plus, it is not your organs transmitting the information, it is the sensors inside your mouth and throat. I pass that on merely to underline that someone, somewhere (the University of Ottawa) has done the research on this.Of course, you could wait to eat until after the sun goes down, if you have the backbone. Remember that it is not the end of the world not to eat if you’re not hungry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5eaaf1c9a329e1700f94319e8bec68e92c8ea38/0_237_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1169155290ab15f4dc8f19a73ff7479","title":"nuno espirito santo coca cola football wolves","story":"Wolves manager predicts a new football cycle but his team’s identity will not alter as they prepare for Europa League actionNuno Espírito Santo has been holding court for about 20 minutes, at one stage comparing the ingredients that go into making Coca-Cola with his own recipe for success at Wolves, when he leans in and makes a prediction that stops everyone in their tracks. “I will not give you clues, but football is gonna change,” Nuno says.That intriguing comment comes in the middle of an answer about whether or not those players who experienced Premier League football for the first time with Wolves last season, when the Midlands club blazed a trail by taking 16 points off the top six, finishing seventh and qualifying for Europe for the first time in 39 years – they face Crusaders in the first leg of their second-round Europa League qualifier on Thursday evening – will be better for the experience.“We started this season trying to develop, trying to improve. We are not going back trying to repeat the same things we did last pre-season. It doesn’t make sense,” Nuno says. “After two years of working we are the same people, we know everything. We have to go and look for better solutions, trying to anticipate. I will not give you clues but football is gonna change.“The football you see now and are reflecting on this season, I will not say next season, but in two seasons’ time, is gonna change. I will not tell you, but there are normal effects of when teams sit, they affect naturally the rest of football. If you consider that … I am already telling you too many things. This is what we are trying to anticipate. All the managers are quite clear on how they want their teams to play, and how to perform. What I am trying to build and improve is, I know, I suspect, going to change.”Asked whether a new cycle is coming, Nuno replies: “I know a new cycle is coming.” So is he talking about other ways of playing, through different systems? “Mmm, OK. You look at that, you look at systems, tactical aspects. But I’m telling you, for sure, in two seasons the football in the Premier League will change.”As with a game of chess, Nuno seems to be thinking a few moves ahead. “It is a lot like chess,” he adds. “I think all the managers, for sure, we have to anticipate. The best way, it is chess. I tried to put myself inside the other managers’ heads. It is a good exercise. If I played against Wolves, what would I do?” Does he ever win in that scenario? “Never,” replies Nuno, with a wry smile.Nuno has a reputation for being a man of few words when it comes to press conferences and it would be easy to form an opinion on him based on some of those awkward exchanges before or after matches. As anyone who is a regular visitor to Molineux will know, his programme notes are just as brief and would struggle to fill the back of a postcard. Small talk of any description is not really Nuno’s thing.Yet the reality is that, in the right setting, the 45-year-old can be fascinating and engaging company. A couple of weeks ago, the former Valencia and Porto manager sat down with half a dozen journalists at Compton, Wolves’ training ground, and spoke candidly for more than 45 minutes across a wide range of topics, taking in everything from the mental cross-examination he puts himself through after a disappointing performance to the unwavering belief that he has in his own philosophy.“Everybody knows how we play, everybody can see. It is the most important thing, an identity,” Nuno says. “When things don’t go so well, what are you gonna grab? Stick to it. It is like Coca-Cola, they never change the recipe. Diet, full sugar, no caffeine, maybe. But the recipe is always there.”Nuno changed the system last season after Wolves picked up only one point from a possible 18, but not his “idea” – something he talks about a lot. The 3-4-3 that had previously served Wolves so well needed another layer, or an “extra line” as Nuno puts it, to give Wolves “the capacity to go higher on the pitch”. Deploying Rúben Neves in a slightly deeper role was the solution.His overriding message, though, is that the basis of his approach – seizing the initiative defensively and stealing possession in areas that leave opponents unbalanced and exposed – will always remain the same. “The idea never changes,” Nuno adds. “I always look at the way I want to be in the game, even if I don’t have the ball I can be in control of the game … my defensive process has to be organised and strong enough to control the game. How I do that? By creating trigger points on where I want to recover the ball.”Interestingly, Nuno takes no credit whatsoever for the decision to pair Raúl Jiménez and Diogo Jota up front midway through the season and the way that those two dovetailed so beautifully thereafter. “That is luck,” he says, almost dismissively. “One day I went: ‘Let’s try.’ Quality and talent of the players and dedication, belief – the way they believe in what you say and propose, it is always about that. You can have the brightest of ideas you can imagine, but if your players don’t believe – pah.” Presumably, though, it is Nuno who engenders that belief? “They give to me, honestly. It is the other way around.”When it goes wrong, however, it is Nuno who shoulders the blame. So much so that his family would like to see him smile now and again. “They say I should enjoy it more. They say: ‘Even when you lose you shouldn’t be so down.’ But how can you not be down? When the team doesn’t play good you go home and you say: ‘Why? Why? Why? Why?’ And you go around the ‘why’ and the ‘how?’ It’s very hard to enjoy.”One of the few occasions when Nuno did have genuine reason to feel low was after the FA Cup semi-final defeat against Watford in April, when Wolves threw away a 2-0 lead with 11 minutes remaining. Yet even then there was much to admire about the way his players responded, taking 10 points from their last five matches to secure seventh spot.Although the transfer window has been frustrating so far for Wolves, pre-season has been rewarding in other ways. Wolves defeated Newcastle 4-0 before beating Manchester City on penalties in Shanghai on Saturday to win the Premier League Asia Trophy. That competition may rank low on their list of priorities this season but it meant a lot to Fosun, the club’s ambitious Chinese owners, and Nuno recognised that afterwards. The Portuguese handed his winners’ medal over to Guo Guangchang, Fosun’s chairman, as soon as he walked off.The pursuit of more silverware starts with Thursday’s first leg against Northern Irish side Crusaders. It is the first European tie that Wolves have taken part in since 1980, when they lost 3-2 on aggregate to PSV Eindhoven in the old Uefa Cup, and the fact that it is a 30,000 sell-out says everything about the mood around Molineux these days. “This is what we work for,” says Nuno, smiling. “We work to give joy to the fans. If the fans are not happy, what’s the point?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef591eda59ad077e432454d6ea9ada11834181b2/0_47_3713_2228/master/3713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0491de48d44177aebe482b00ffcb717","title":"steve bruce newcastle mike ashley bagman","story":"• New manager aims to forge close ties with Newcastle owner• Many Newcastle fans have not welcomed Bruce’s arrivalAt approximately the same time on Wednesday as Britain’s new prime minister stood in Downing Street outlining a prescription for change, Newcastle United’s new head coach detailed a bold manifesto of his own.Ostensibly, Boris Johnson and Steve Bruce have little in common – even if many observers predict their two tenures will end in tears – yet both are obsessed with redefining relationships.Whereas separation from Europe remains Johnson’s fixation, Bruce’s emphasis is on somehow succeeding where Rafael Benítez failed and creating a close, yet equal, partnership with Mike Ashley.Newcastle’s owner joined his latest manager on Tyneside on Wednesday, after landing at the training ground in his helicopter. “Getting on with the people you work for is always key to any success,” Bruce said. “It’s up to me to strike up a relationship and, so far, he’s been straight as a die. I’m sure that will continue.”Given that fans deeply disenchanted by Benítez’s resignation are not only underwhelmed by Bruce’s installation but planning to boycott Newcastle’s opening home game against Arsenal next month, the former Sheffield Wednesday manager knows delicate diplomacy will be called for. He is well aware another predecessor, Alan Pardew, was almost hounded out of Toon after being perceived as Ashley’s puppet.“I’m not going to be anybody’s ‘yes’ man,” Bruce said. “I’m too long in the tooth for that. I’ve heard it said that I’m a puppet but I’m not Mike Ashley’s bagman or anything else. I’m my own man. All I ask is to be given a chance. Whoever was sitting here would find it difficult, Rafa had quite phenomenal, unbelievable support from the fans, and they are big shoes to fill. But let me have a crack.”Benítez quit after deciding that Ashley could not match his ambitions for Newcastle and Bruce too craves much more than merely avoiding relegation. “Rafa’s ended up going and working in China,” he said, slightly pointedly, after settling into a seat which had earlier been occupied by Joelinton, Newcastle’s new record £40m Brazilian striker. “It’s definitely not the case that the ambition here is finishing 17th. Of course Mike Ashley wants more than 17th. We’ve got to take the club forward.”Which is where he believes the FA Cup could come in. “At Hull we got to the final,” Bruce said. “That’s got to be an aim here. I’ve put my neck on the line immediately with that but it’s not just about being happy to stay in the ision. That would be wrong.“Everyone knows it’s very, very difficult now to get anywhere near the top of the Premier League. But we’ll try our best. Can we win the FA Cup? Can we win the League Cup? If Hull can stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final surely Newcastle has the tools too?”Similarly Bruce backs his abilities to confound the doubters. “I understand I’m not the majority of supporters’ cup of tea,” he said. “And I’m not Rafa Benítez, who is an extremely good manager. I have broad shoulders and I will need them. But hopefully, given time, I’ll win people round and the supporters will say ‘he’s not so bad after all’.”Although many friends, Alan Shearer included, cautioned him against accepting the job, Bruce could not reject the club he supported as a boy.The acrimony-enveloped journey from Hillsborough has cost him a lot of friends in South Yorkshire. “I’ve been totally selfish,” he said. “I feel for the players, the staff and everyone at Sheffield Wednesday but I had to have a crack at this. I think I’ve got the tools to take this club forward.”Joelinton’s arrival represents a useful restocking of the attacking armoury. “I watched him playing for Hoffenheim against Manchester City in the Champions League and he’s very, very good,” Bruce said. “I’m delighted with him. Hopefully over the next two weeks we’ll get three or four more in.

It’s petered out a bit to be honest.83 min: A couple for switches for Sporting: Eduardo Quaresma, Gonzalo Plata, Daniel Bragança and Eduardo are on to replace Ilori, Raphinha, Wendel and the brilliant Bruno Fernandes.81 min: Sneaky run by Milner up the left flank but his volley off a Fabinho cross deflects off a Sporting defender and out for a corner. 76 min: More substitutions for both sides for the final quarter hour. For Liverpool, it’s Brewster, Jones, Lovren and Lallana come on for Origi, Van Dijk, Henderson and Wijnaldum. For Sporting, Nuno Mendes and Miguel Luís enter for Mathieu and Doumbia.69 min: A mistake in the Liverpool midfield leads to a 2v2 break and a chance for Sporting, but Mignolet is there to save Belloli’s low shot to the far post.65 min: Rollicking atmosphere here in the Bronx as a slow patch of action on the pitch is peppered with songs and chants throughout the packed crowd. We’ve received a number of queries about the format for tonight’s, er, cup final. If the score is level after 90 minutes, there will be no extra time and no penalty shootout. 61 min: Waves of substitutions from both sides at the hour mark. Harry Wilson, Joe Gomez, Ryan Kent replace Oxlade-Chamberlain, Robertson and Alexander-Arnold for Liverpool. For Sporting Lisbon, it’s Coates, Dost and Jovane coming on for Neto, Luiz Phellype and Vietto. 57 min: Neto, who’s on a yellow, makes a harsh challenge on Wijnaldum, who wins a free kick from a dangerous spot on the side of the box. Milner takes it, swinging it in with pace and it takes a deflection ... but just shoots wide of the far post for a corner. Alexander-Arnold’s attempt finds Van Dijk on the far post ... he heads it down but he’s denied by the post. Unlucky!Bruno Fernandes accelerates down the left flank, cuts back and slides it to Wendel in the middle of the area and he coolly finishes from seven yards past an outstretched Mignolet.50 min: A good, patient spell of possession here for Sporting Lisbon in the final third results in a corner. Wendel’s offering played short to Hernandes, but he’s dispossessed by Wijnaldum and it’s cleared.49 min: Bruno Fernandes has another go from distance from the top of the circle but it skids just wide right of the target. The Sporting captain has been at the heart of everything for his side tonight.48 min: Alexander-Arnold’s corner is cleared and it falls on the break for Sporting, but Mignolet comes out of his box and clears an overcooked through pass from danger. 47 min: Van Dijk lets it rip from 30 yards and it sails about 20 feet over the goal into the seats along the first baseline. Optimistic.46 min: And we’re off in the second half!This match is, in fact, for a trophy. Something called the Western Union Cup. Unclear what it’s made of but we’re told it’s much lighter than Old Big Ears. And unlike many of these pre-season affairs on American soil (including last night’s), tonight’s match will not be settled by penalties if were drawn after 90 minutes. That means Liverpool and Sporting will have to do with sharing it for the next year.Luciano Vietto’s header at the death gives Liverpool a scare, but Mignolet makes a brilliant save and there’s the whistle for the half.45 min: The fourth official signals for one minute of added time.As I was just saying ... Wijnaldum, who’s been a handful for the Sporting back four all night, capitalizes on a mistake by Neto, who badly misjudges Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross, and calmly finishes.43 min: Liverpool finishing the half strong here, keeping Sporting on the back foot even if they don’t have a second goal to show for it. 41 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross from the edge of the box nearly finds the head of Wijnaldum, but it’s cleared by a Sporting defender amid oohs from the crowd. 35 min: Marcus Wendel sells Fabingo on the dummy, buys himself some space and rips a shot off the post, which nearly hits Mignolet on the rebound and goes in the goal but luckily rolls the other way and out for a corner. Moments later Bruno Fernandes’s attempt is nearly converted but is sent out for a goal kick. A dangerous spell for Sporting at the moment. 33 min: Fabinho is whistled for an overzealous challenge on Bruno Fernandes and the goalscorer will look to notch a second from a dangerous area ... but this time his shot is off target.30 min: Luís Neto is shown yellow for a tardy, two-footed challenge on Wijnaldum.28 min: Moments after a Sporting Lisbon chance, Liverpool are quick to counter and a Milner cross toward the edge of the area finds Robertson, who uncorks a thunderbolt that sails a couple of feet over the crossbar. 22 min: Word is fans are still queued up to get into the stadium thanks to an undermanned security detail, but the stands at Yankee Stadium are nearly full by now apart from the closed-off mezzanine with a rollicking atmosphere to match.Roberton’s nifty cross to the head of Henderson is saved, but Origi is there to poke in the rebound from point-blank range and Liverpool are level in the Bronx!18 min: Liverpool have done well to recover after that early surprise, keeping possession, winning a few corners and creating a steady string of chances. Another corner from Trent Alexander-Arnold just now finds the head of Van Dijk in the center of the area and his header demands a highlight-reel save from Renan Ribeiro.12 min: Liverpool win another corner when a well-timed tackle by Tiago Ilori on Oxlade-Chamberlain puts it out past the goal line. It’s whipped in by Alexander-Arnold and Matip’s header clangs off the woodwork! But it wouldn’t have counted with the referee whistling for a foul.10 min: A sharply hit shot by Origi is cleared past the goal line by a Sporting defender for another Liverpool corner, but it’s cleared easily. 9 min: A patient build-up by Liverpool ends with their first corner of the match after a Wijnaldum shot caroms out. Alas, nothing comes of it and it’s cleared past the halfway line. Well. After a bit of a meandering start for both sides, Bruno Fernandes hits from 30 yards out, a speculative shot with a bit of movement, and it clangs off Mignolet’s hands and spins into the goal. Yikes on bikes! A freak goal if ever there was one. 1 min: And they’re off!

Other banks are expected to announce higher headline rates over the coming months.Why are overdrafts being overhauled?The Financial Conduct Authority said in June 2019 that it was introducing a raft of measures to fix the UK’s “dysfunctional” overdraft market. It said consumers “cannot meaningfully compare or work out the cost of borrowing as a result of complex and opaque charges”. Costs vary dramatically. Unauthorised overdrafts can be hideously expensive: the FCA said the typical cost of going just £100 into the red without permission was £5 a day – which the regulator expects to fall to less than 20p a day as a result of its changes.What is the solution?The regulator is simplifying and standardising the way banks charge for overdrafts. For example, it is banning them from charging higher prices for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised ones. And it will require everyone to price overdrafts using a simple annual interest rate.Will it work?The problem is that with one-size-fits-all solutions, there are always winners and losers. PricewaterhouseCoopers recently warned: “The potential loss of income these rules create … could lead to firms seeking to make up their losses through higher arranged overdraft rates, loss of interest-free buffers, additional current account charges or tighter lending criteria.” The FCA has accepted some of this – for example, it said it recognised that “those with heavier use of arranged overdrafts may pay more than at present”. But at the same time, vulnerable consumers – some of whom, said the FCA, were disproportionately hit by excessive charges for going into the red without permission – will almost certainly see their borrowing costs fall.Nationwide is the first major provider to respond to the FCA’s clampdown announced in June, which the regulator said would “make overdrafts simpler, fairer, and easier to manage”.The FCA announced it would be stopping banks from charging higher prices for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised ones, banning fixed daily or monthly charges for borrowing in this way, and requiring banks to price overdrafts using a simple annual interest rate.The FCA said the current overdraft market was “dysfunctional” and “causing significant consumer harm”. There are 26 million UK overdraft users, and they are a huge cash cow for banks, which made more than £2.4bn from them in one year alone (2017).Authorised overdraft costs vary hugely and are often baffling – some banks impose daily fees, some charge monthly fees, some charge interest on the amount owed, and some use a combination of these. Unauthorised overdrafts can be punishingly expensive.That is almost double the 24p in interest that someone with a FlexAccount borrowing £500 for one day on an arranged basis would pay now. However, based on this scenario, those holding Nationwide’s FlexDirect or FlexPlus account are currently charged 50p a day.The society is also scrapping the £250 fee-free buffer offered on FlexPlus authorised overdrafts, and said there would be additional text alerts to help members manage their money.In June the FCA appeared to predict the steps taken by Nationwide, and those likely to be taken by other banks and building societies, when it said its shakeup “could create winners and losers, as firms would be likely to seek to recover lost overdraft revenue from within their overdraft offering by, for example, increasing arranged overdraft prices and reducing interest-free buffers”.It added that it was particularly concerned about the welfare of vulnerable consumers."},{"url":null,"title":"teen rapper tay k sentenced to 55 years the race","story":"Taymor McIntyre sentenced along with six other men for death of Ethan Walker, after recording platinum hit The Race as a fugitiveUS rapper Tay-K has been sentenced to 55 years in prison for murder, with a platinum-certified hit song he released as a fugitive being included in prosecution evidence.Taymor McIntyre, 19, was found guilty along with six other men of the killing of Ethan Walker, in Mansfield, Texas, in July 2016. The men had intended to rob Walker and another man of drugs and money and in the subsequent home invasion, Walker was shot dead. His girlfriend testified that he’d had his hands in the air when he was killed.McIntyre’s lawyers had argued he didn’t fire the lethal shot, and the rapper testified that his job in the robbery had been to find drugs to steal, but he was found guilty of murder as well as three counts of aggravated robbery.McIntyre’s rap career grew as the infamy of his case brought him to national attention. After being charged with murder, aged 16, McIntyre was placed under house arrest, but in March 2017 he removed his ankle tag and fled, writing on Twitter: “fuck dis house arrest shit … they gn hav 2 catch me”. He made his way north from Texas to New Jersey, where he recorded The Race, a track that boasted of his fugitive status: “Ain’t beat that case, bitch I did the race.”The track reached No 44 in the US charts, and was remixed by prominent rappers including 21 Savage, Tyga and Lil Yachty. The video has been viewed more than 174m times on YouTube, and the song was certified platinum in January 2018. Prosecutors played the video during the trial, which features McIntyre filmed in front of his own wanted poster, and showed the song’s lyrics to the court.McIntyre was recaptured in June 2017, and is accused of two further serious crimes committed while on the run: the murder of 23-year-old Mark Salar following an altercation in San Antonio, Texas, and the robbery and beating of 65-year-old Owney Pepe in Arlington, Texas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb51b43bc8f9b181f62900f31fe57715564bd5d/0_0_2318_1545/master/2318.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d63a67fe2f8f005b80c156ecae1c1581 1400w","title":"eu ready boris johnso brexit plan michel barnier","story":"Tusk mocks new PM’s ability to bluff as Barnier asks: is it an orderly Brexit, or a no deal?Boris Johnson was put under pressure on his first day as prime minister by both Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier to explain “in detail” his Brexit plan.In a curt letter of congratulations, Tusk, the European council president, made a thinly-veiled reference to Johnson’s reputation for bluffing his way through difficulties.“I look forward to meeting you to discuss – in detail – our cooperation,” he wrote to Johnson.The former prime minister of Poland, who has urged the UK to rethink its decision to leave the EU, has previously spoken of a “special place in hell” for “those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan”.Barnier, who as the EU’s chief negotiator crafted the withdrawal agreement with Theresa May, said it was “a very important moment for Brexit”, with the UK due to leave the bloc with or without a deal in just three months.On the steps of Downing Street, Johnson had vowed to lead the UK out of the EU, “no ifs, ands or buts” but Barnier conceded that he was unsure of the substance of Johnson’s plan to come to a deal with the EU on the terms of the UK’s departure.“We look forward to hearing what the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants, what are the choices of the UK,” Barnier said, after his own consultations with the European parliament on the new British leadership.“Is it an orderly Brexit? … Is it a no-deal Brexit? The no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU, but we are prepared for an orderly Brexit. We will work along the next few weeks or months with the new UK government in the best possible way, in the very constructive spirit to facilitate the ratification of the withdrawal agreement.”The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers is expected.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May’s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy – something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwasn’t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn’t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn’t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out.Such has been the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May’s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care the future of the NHS a climate emergency the increasingly insecure future of work a broken housing market rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.Critics might say this is Johnson’s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle.Asked whether he knew what Johnson would seek from Brussels, Barnier said: “No. We are ready to listen and to work with him in a constructive way. We will wait for the new decision, the new declarations of the UK government.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sought to emphasise the ties between the UK and continental Europe, in a sign of the concern among some EU leaders at the burgeoning relationship between Johnson and the US president Donald Trump, who spoke the day before of his belief in the new prime minister.In her letter to Johnson, Merkel wrote: “The ties between our countries are distinguished by deep friendship and close partnership.“We are linked by personal ties between people, economic relations between companies, our common engagement for a rules-based international order and our common European heritage.”Earlier in the day, the European parliament’s Brexit steering group held an “extraordinary meeting” to discuss the developments in London.A statement from the MEPs, led by the former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, said recent comments “not least those made during the Conservative party leadership campaign, have greatly increased the risk of a disorderly exit of the UK”.Johnson has said he wants to scrap the Irish backstop from the withdrawal agreement and hold back on paying the UK’s multi-billion-pound financial settlement until a free trade deal is agreed. He has warned that the UK must leave the EU by 31 October with or without a deal but that the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit would prove to be “vanishingly small”.Verhofstadt told reporters that the EU would not countenance a fresh negotiation on arrangements to replicate key aspects of the withdrawal agreement and cushion the impact of a no-deal Brexit.The EU insists that a stand-still transition period will be granted only if the withdrawal agreement, including the contentious backstop, is ratified by parliament.Verhofstadt said: “Politicised language from the Conservative leadership raising the spectre of a no-deal Brexit is unhelpful, irresponsible and only increases the risks of a catastrophic severance, which could destabilise the global economy.“We are united in the view that a no-deal exit will not be mitigated by any form of arrangements or mini-deals between the EU and the UK.“Boris Johnson will find the European parliament an open and constructive partner. I look forward to alleviating Mr Johnson’s concerns regarding the imminent accession of Turkey to the EU, following the claims of the leave campaign, whilst explaining the EU has no rules on the packaging of kippers in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76690ccaa09f37c88a7e130699126b2a9b577b00/0_139_3164_1899/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98957ed0cd109323e4629c835f906987","title":"england ireland test match report tim murtagh lords cricket","story":"Well, it all panned out more or less as expected to enable the sages to sit back comfortably in their armchairs. The consensus was that on a flat, green pitch the ball might do a bit in the first couple of hours at Lord’s and then batting would become a much more straightforward exercise as the sun scorched any lingering demons. And so it proved. Sort of.Now take a look at the scorecard and gasp. England, who won the toss on a cloudless day, were bowled out by Ireland for 85 in 23.4 overs, their shortest completed Test innings in this country. Tim Murtagh, the Middlesex stalwart, snared five for 13 in his first and only spell of nine overs.Then as the surface began to change colour like a chameleon, Ireland managed to compile a first-innings lead of 122. In its own way this outcome was just as staggering as the conclusion of the World Cup at the same ground 10 days ago. It was just that there was more time for an astonishing sequence of events to sink in.This was supposed to be a gentle dress rehearsal for the Ashes for Joe Root and his men. Four days would be sufficient (they were probably right on that score). The Irish, with half a dozen doughty cricketers in the autumn of their careers, would provide gritty but none too taxing opposition before the first Test against Australia next week. But it did not quite work out like that. Down in Southampton, where the Australians are engaged in a fierce battle among themselves in preparation for the Test, they may have stopped snarling at one another for a while to embark on a group guffaw.In front of 20,000 spectators, which constitutes a triumph for those in charge here, England’s batting displayed all the solidity of a blancmange. And so the famous hum at Lord’s became rather more animated and confused.However the match situation means that there may be some compelling cricket ahead, far more than anticipated. England will have to play well to get out of this mess.Next week at Edgbaston England’s latest top three will be confronted by a pace attack who consistently exceed 90mph. Perhaps they will prefer that to the slow torture, so skilfully delivered by Murtagh, who cruised in from the Nursery End just as he has been doing here in county cricket over the past dozen years. Murtagh propelled his missiles at little more than 75mph, slow enough for the batsmen to contemplate how they might combat him and then to consider changing their minds.On this surface Murtagh found a perfect length and line the batsmen prodded and poked and he either found their pads, their outside edge or, in the case of Jonny Bairstow, the stumps.Murtagh was masterful, hitting the seam, finding just enough movement and ultimately mesmerising a worryingly fragile English middle order. At 37 he became the fourth oldest seamer to take a five-wicket haul in Test cricket since the second world war after Courtney Walsh (38), Richard Hadlee (39) and Geoff Chubb (40), the last of whom was playing for South Africa against England in 1946.The alarm bells did not ring too loudly at the start despite the early departure of Jason Roy in his first Test innings. Roy would have been lbw if Mark Adair had not overstepped but in the next over he was caught at slip when prodding hard at another probing delivery from Murtagh. Even so England reached the relative tranquillity of 36 for one whereupon there was mayhem. Joe Denly, who would end as England’s top scorer with 23, was lbw to Adair, and thus became the first of six wickets to fall for seven runs.Rory Burns fell to Murtagh, who would soon dispatch Bairstow, Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, none of whom managed to get off the mark. In the meantime Root was patently lbw to Adair though for the first time in their brief Test history the Irish had to resort to using the review system to send the England captain on his way. There were a few thumps from Sam Curran and Olly Stone but England were all out before lunch and before reaching three figures.By late afternoon Ireland had reached the dizzy heights of 132 for two, which meant that utter humiliation for Root’s side was on the horizon. The Irish openers had been removed by Sam Curran, Root’s fourth port of call, but then Andrew Balbirnie and Paul Stirling added 87 together. Both were missed behind the stumps from thin edges off Stuart Broad, who was not quite able to hide his frustration.Now Ireland’s innings stuttered though not so spectacularly as England’s. Broad and Stone made inroads, taking three wickets each with the latter catching the eye. Stone sometimes exceeded 90 mph, sometimes he contrived some movement in the air away from the right-handers and he seemed to know where the ball was going to land. On a grim day this was the undoubted highlight for England. Curran also took three wickets without moving the ball much, which is a handy attribute.Kevin O’Brien, the 50-ball centurion of Bangalore in 2011, batted as if he was playing in a Test, eking out his runs with barely a shot in anger, an unusual approach. Meanwhile Murtagh gave himself some room and swung merrily finding the boundary four times against Broad, which only appeared to add to the bowler’s exasperation. England’s latest opener, Jack Leach, survived the one over of England’s second innings to complete a bizarre day of Test cricket."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5b722c96e2eea876577c1a27f4ee4cd1b69d5c4/0_228_3674_2204/master/3674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e513c5f8844241bdd4f1207023d7f632","title":"rugby league president tony adams promoting game","story":"Tony Adams said his role as the Rugby Football League’s president will not involve him offering advice to those already working in the sport. He will focus on promoting the game rather than attempting to have a hands-on role like Clive Woodward did when he took up a position in another sport.The 52-year-old former Arsenal and England defender took over on Wednesday as Andy Burnham’s successor, having been approached to take up the one-year role as president. Adams has forged a strong relationship with rugby league in recent years owing to the sport’s links with the Sporting Chance clinic but said he would not overstep the mark.Woodward, the former England rugby union coach, had an ill-fated 13-month spell as Southampton’s technical director in 2005-06 and Adams said: “I don’t want to get involved in the technical side of the game. I’m not sitting here like Woodward did when he went in at Southampton: I don’t claim to be an expert when it comes to this sport, it’s just not what I’m about.“I’m here for the game’s profile, and if I can shed some extra light on this great sport, then I’m definitely here to do that. I’m not a technical director, or anything like that – I’m the president, and this is all about cementing and promoting relationships.”Adams will call on the expertise of his former England teammate and keen league fan Stuart Pearce to ensure his tenure as president is as successful as possible.“Stuart loves the game,” Adams said. “I bumped into him last week at a game. He loves it to bits and I’m going to use him in my team to spread the word that it’s a fantastic sport. I love the honest, open approach and the physical side of the game. I’ve been bored out of my brains at some recent football games with all the sideways passing. I’m not trying to say I hate football and I’m now all about rugby league, but it is a great sport.”Adams admitted that while he is not familiar with the finer details, he has been impressed by the work done in local communities and the promotion of player welfare.“They’ve got players going into prisons and mentoring young offenders, which is great stuff. You don’t see top international footballers doing that. Anything I can do to help, I will. Sporting Chance wouldn’t just get into bed with anyone, and I won’t take this role lightly.The governing body has confirmed it is still to finalise Ottawa’s entry into the professional structure next year. Speculation is mounting that the backers behind the bid – led by the Toronto Wolfpack founder, Eric Perez – have been unable to convince the RFL they will be ready to enter in 2020. “We’re not ready to confirm it,” Simon Johnson, the RFL’s chairman, said. “Discussions are well-advanced, but there’s a board meeting in August when it’s again on the agenda.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/276f442ef211d2dcafe06529728fa5fac21ed8c9/0_220_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33b5cdea1ecaa8a94b291fbdefd19af7","title":"share your experiences of netball","story":"Following New Zealand winning the Women’s Netball World Cup, we would like to hear your stories of playing the sportThe world of women and sport is rapidly changing.

Not cool at all,” wrote the six-time Tony Award winner on Twitter on Sunday.The Terrence McNally play, first staged in 1987 and later adapted for film, is a romance that opens with the two characters in the throes of passion in a sex scene.The 49-year-old star has featured in multiple television series including The Good Wife, The Good Fight and Grey’s Anatomy and won plaudits for her performance as Billie Holiday in both the West End and Broadway in Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar \u0026amp Grill.But until Frankie and Johnny, she said she had never before performed a nude scene on stage.Before the show opened in May, she publicly shared her fears about doing the scene in an interview.“Maybe strippers get real used to it,” she told the New York Times, “but for me there’s nothing normal about that. So there’s nowhere in my mind that I can drift off and let this just kind of happen, because everything about it is demanding that you be present.”The director Arin Arbus brought in an intimacy coordinator – as is increasingly common on stage and screen in the wake of the #MeToo movement – to help stage it.A spokesperson for the production said the theatre has a “no-photo policy” and that if an audience member is spotted taking a photo or video, they are asked by a member of the theatre staff to delete them.“The photographer is then asked to show their ‘deleted’ folder and empty it so there is no record of it still on the phone. If they refuse to hand over their camera, they are asked to leave the theatre,” he added.“The ushers and house management are vigilant they are always on the lookout for cameras through the performance, and make announcements pre-show and after intermission.”Unwanted photos during nude scenes is an ongoing problem for theatres. In 2009, nude photographs of Anna Friel reportedly emerged online while she was starring in Breakfast at Tiffany’s in the West End."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04fcb629fad41fbf661e7ff1d350f23eeaa27d9/213_96_2959_1775/master/2959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fde86f2268d9b79c63446606b36e0fa1","title":"tesla elon musk earnings report shares loss","story":"Losses come even as Elon Musk’s company says it’s delivering a record-breaking number of vehiclesDespite selling more cars than ever, Tesla is still struggling to prove it is profitable and has suffered a series of high-profile exits. JB Straubel, the CTO, will be replaced by the vice-president of technology, Drew Baglino, Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, announced on a call with investors on Wednesday.“This has nothing to do with lack of confidence for the company,” Straubel said on the call. “I will be helping as I can, just no longer in an executive role.”More than a dozen executives have departed Tesla in the past year, including the vice-president of interior and exterior engineering Steve MacManus, the vice-president Peter Hochholdinger, and the European leader Jan Oehmicke in 2019. In 2018, Tesla lost Jon McNeill, the president of global sales and services, Susan Repo, the corporate treasurer and vice-president of finance, and chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja, among others.“Overall, a bad report that will inevitably lead to more questions about its ability to stabilize and turn a profit,” Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing said.On the call, Musk said Tesla expects to break even this quarter and make a profit by next quarter. He stressed that the company would focus more aggressively on service facilities in upcoming quarters. In quarter two, it opened 25 new service centers while facing complaints from customers about service operations.The losses in quarter two come despite Tesla previously reporting it delivered a record-breaking 95,356 vehicles and produced a record 87,048 vehicles, but analysts noted selling cars may not necessarily lead to profit. Former and current Tesla employees said they were forced to take shortcuts to meet these aggressive production goals.“Tesla struggles to fulfill its ambitious goals and promises on a long-term basis, and stumbles at logistical impediments despite huge advances in technology that keep consumers and investors interested,” said Alyssa Altman, a transportation lead at the digital consultancy Publicis Sapient. “To avoid a total car crash of the business in the next few years, Tesla needs to refocus its efforts from maintaining the appearance of a profitable and sustainable business model to actually delivering one.”The lower-than-expected earnings also come after federal tax credits for Tesla vehicles were decreased from $3,750 per vehicle to $1,875 after 30 June.Musk, Tesla’s CEO, has also battled personal and professional scandals in the past year, including being fined and sanctioned by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for tweeting that he planned to take the company private, and for later tweeting “inaccurate” information about Tesla to his followers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833edc16435de60d406f1a7367fc5f25b02be4c9/0_205_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec257a2b3ea255833e8a11875b9221","title":"mix it up the mixologists guide to drinking rum","story":"Still drinking gin? Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

But brace yourself – there are dangers everywhere in the wildIn Kenya, a newborn elephant calf, Safina, skates on the mud, all wobbly legs – her mother scoots her along, trunk on bottom. The wildlife camerawoman, Sue Gibson, can’t contain her delight (as well as the baby animals, we meet three camera operators). “Poor little baby,” she says, laughing. “It’s so undignified.” They are social animals, “and survival depends on forming these bonds quickly”. Safina and another baby elephant cuddle each other with their trunks. Then there’s alarm as another herd approach, but it’s fine – it’s Safina’s aunt and the older elephants greet each other warmly, trunks embracing. “They really look like they’re happy to see each other,” says Gibson. It’s completely lovely.Next, we watch a clan of hyenas, where a dozen cubs have been born. Hyenas don’t tend to come off well in nature documentaries, but here they are adorable and fascinating. They live in a “female-led hierarchy” and the alpha female Soup has 12-week-old twin girls, Bisque and Chowder (even their names are cute). They squeak, mewl and follow their mother, learning their place in the hierarchy – this basically means nipping other cubs, including an older, bigger male. “It’s really great to see them with the other cubs,” says the thrilled cameraman Vianet Djenguet, “throwing their weight around.” But there’s danger everywhere: lions will attack hyenas, as will elephants. An elephant charges and the cubs run and hide. “I just have to remind myself that half of those cubs won’t make it,” says Djenguet.Spare a thought, too, for the baby southern sea otters picked off by great white sharks. Sharks don’t tend to eat otters, but they will have a nibble to see if it’s something they might like. And the otters are “too small to survive the wounds” – sharks are responsible for half of otter deaths. Here is a six-week-old sea otter, Limpet (so-called because he won’t leave his mother’s side he must have an inkling that she plans to abandon him when he is six months old). If Limpet is going to survive, he must learn to e. But he can’t at the moment because the air trapped in his dense juvenile fur – more hairs on each square centimetre than on an entire human head – is acting “like a little lifejacket”. Facts such as this stop the show, the first in a series, feeling like a wasted – if enjoyable – afternoon spent watching baby animal videos on the internet.In Sri Lanka, a tiny, hairless toque macaque, named Jazir, has been born to an alpha female. He clings – a tiny, wrinkled Sméagol – to his mother with little pink fingers. The great white shark equivalent here is lost habitat and its ills. “Where there are people, there are dogs,” we are told – and they hunt baby monkeys. There is a panicked moment when the dogs attack, but the mother makes it up the tree in time with Jazir clinging to her.In Uganda, the beautiful Nyakabara, snoozing with her mother, is one of possibly only 50 mountain gorilla babies in the world. These apes climb trees to get to fruit, even though gorillas are heavy (some weigh more than 180kg) and falls kill many. There’s a heart-stopping scene where Nyakabara has to cling to her mother, who is climbing a tree. Then – no! – the branch they are on snaps, and they plummet from view. It’s not until the next day that Djenguet and the conservation team track the family and find Nyakabara and her mother have survived. They disappear, baby still clinging on, into the trees.By the time we finish with some Arctic fox cubs emerging from their den in Iceland, I feel I have gorged on sweetness. They gambol, play fight and practise pouncing. The threat of doom is never far away – the summer is short and so is the food supply – so you can never truly relax into the adorableness of it all, but there is something so cheering about the babies’ determination and their mothers’ care.Normally, I find the personal observations of wildlife camera operators irritating, but it works here – mainly because delight is an emotion best shared. When the young sea otter takes his first e, the proud cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson says, “It’s almost like seeing your kid ride a bike for the first time.”When a baby female mountain gorilla beats her chest, mimicking the alpha male, Djenguet says, “You can’t get any better than that.” I think he may be right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a61d286a98eeb920d89fd618dfa9488b8df2aa/317_136_2166_1301/master/2166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf0df013308c7f28081c7e132d7f34a8","title":"young people uk abandon tv news almost entirely ofcom","story":"Over-65s watch 33 minutes a day, but those aged 16-24 watch two on average, says OfcomYoung people in Britain have almost entirely abandoned television news broadcasts, according to Ofcom, while half of the country now gets its news from social media.While the average person aged 65 and over watches 33 minutes of TV news a day, this falls to just two minutes among people aged 16-24, according the media regulator’s annual news consumption report.The decline has been driven by audiences moving away from traditional live broadcast channels, where they might watch a popular drama and leave the channel on during the evening news bulletin, towards watching catchup content from streaming services.The shift could have major implications for British politics, given services such as Netflix do not provide any news. Political parties have traditionally considered the BBC’s 10pm news bulletin to be their most important outlet for getting their message across to large swaths of the public, which in turn can shape policies being proposed and how they are presented. TV news is still the main way that the British public learn about current affairs, however, in part because older viewers have remained loyal to traditional services.Ofcom’s research also suggests that people are increasingly willing to wade into online arguments about news. “There is evidence that UK adults are consuming news more actively via social media. For example, those who access news shared by news organisations, trending news or news stories from friends and family or other people they follow via Facebook or Twitter are more likely to make comments on the new posts they see compared to the previous year.”The Ofcom report also highlights that annual sales of national print newspapers have halved from 22m in 2010 to 10.4m in 2018. Some news media, particularly MailOnline and the , have managed to build their overall audience by attracting new readers online.The findings provide further evidence that the British media is splitting along generational and ethnic lines. Older people and white Britons are largely sticking with television and print newspaper outlets, while younger people and those from minority ethnic backgrounds are following a largely separate news agenda on social media."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f82f404830bd9e05b6f24192086acee611c84e8/0_147_2861_1717/master/2861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ba3e98a94eab707a405cd5c6e1d8f52","title":"flyboard inventor franky zapata record channel crossing","story":"Franky ‘Flyman’ Zapata set for takeoff on invention that wowed Macron and MerkelThe French hoverboard star Franky Zapata will attempt to cross the Channel on Thursday using the invention that wowed world leaders and Champs-Élysées crowds on Bastille Day.The former jetski champion will attempt to make the 20-minute crossing on his turbo-powered hoverboard – the Flyboard Air – to mark the 110th anniversary of French aviator Louis Blériot’s first cross-Channel airplane flight.Zapata, 40, nicknamed “Flyman” by French media, is expected to take off at the beach at Sangatte near Calais and land at an unspecified site near Dover.He will refuel halfway across, landing on a vessel in the middle of the Channel to change the 37kg backpack that contains fuel for the Flyboard.Hours before the attempt, Zapata appeared cautious about his chances of success. Asked if he was ready, he replied: “As ready as we can be”.“We’ve had to double the range of the machine. It’s a little complicated … but we think we can do it,” he told RMC radio on Wednesday. Zapata said he wanted to “follow in the footsteps of the great aviation pioneers”.“I’ve always been fan of Blériot and I was looking for a new challenge. If we can cross the Channel on the 110 anniversary … it’s a crazy challenge.”Zapata added: “It’s a busy ferry lane. I will land on a boat in the middle of the Channel, change my (fuel) bag and take off again immediately.”French maritime authorities had initially refused to approve the flight, saying it was too dangerous to attempt over one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, but stopped short of a ban. On Wednesday, they had a change of heart.Coastal officials said they had approved the flight after Zapata had given them numerous guarantees.“He detailed his safety plan and his measures for refuelling at sea … this has allowed the maritime prefect to take a decision to lift the refusal to approve the crossing,” a spokesperson for the maritime prefecture said.Zapata impressed France with a demonstration of his Flyboard at this year’s Bastille Day parade in front of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Angela Merkel, along with other world leaders.“It’s the realisation of a dream,” the inventor told Le Parisien this week, adding that he was “very stressed”. He said the Bastille Day demonstration was easy by comparison.Zapata, from Marseille, made his first Flyboard flight three years ago. “I lost two fingers torn off in the turbines and the machine crashed into the wall of my workshop. After that, I had to really negotiate with my wife for her to let me get on it again,” he said in an interview.“But when I saw the machine fly I said this is what I have to do with my life. I have to see it through to the end”.On Wednesday, as he tested the Flyboard, Zapata said he expected to make the 22-mile (36km) crossing at an average speed of 87mph (140kmh) and at an altitude of between 15 and 20 metres (50-65ft) above sea level.The French government’s defence and procurement agency awarded Zapata a €1.3m (£1.2m) grant to develop the hoverboard last December after the inventor was approached by foreign investors.The Flyboard Air is powered by five mini turbo engines, can run autonomously for about 10 minutes and reach speeds of up to 118mph.Florence Parly, the French armed forces minister, has said the machine could be tested for different kinds of uses, for example as a flying logistical platform or an assault platform."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31294d0795c53da07d65620972a6ee7e6e848889/0_5_986_592/master/986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2800da018f83ccd8413d86dfadcb83a","title":"iran hints at ship swap with uk amid de escalation efforts","story":"Hassan Rouhani spoke after Iraqi president’s visit to Iran at request of UK defence ministryIran has indicated it wants to de-escalate the British-Iranian crisis, hinting at swapping two captured tankers.“We do not seek the continuation of tension with some European countries,” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Wednesday during a weekly cabinet meeting. “If Britain steps away from the wrong actions in Gibraltar, they will receive an appropriate response from Iran.”He was speaking after a two-day visit by Iraq’s prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who had revealed he went to Tehran this week partly at the request of the UK defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, to negotiate the release of the captured British-flagged ship Stena Impero seized by Iranian forces in the strait of Hormuz last Friday.The Iraqi prime minister revealed that on Monday “there was a phone call with the British defence minister to discuss bilateral ties, the regional crisis, and efforts of de-escalation and decreasing tensions in the region, and also the existing crisis covering the confiscated ships”. Iraq is a strong opponent of US sanctions against Iran.Iran said it had seized the Stena Impero after the UK seized an Iranian ship, Grace 1, off Gibraltar. The Foreign Office has claimed continuing negotiations with Iranian officials in London about the terms of the ship’s release were interrupted by the surprise Iranian decision to capture the Stena Impero. Britain has offered to release Grace 1 as long as Iran provides guarantees that the ship will not continue with a plan to unload Iran’s oil at the Syrian port of Baniyas refinery. The UK has said any export sales to the refinery are prohibited under EU law.Iran said the oil was not destined for Syria but will not name its actual destination, saying that would expose the customer to US sanctions.The new US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said on Wednesday, than Washington was also seeking to defuse the standoff in the Gulf.“We’re trying to deescalate and at the same time message them very clearly that without preconditions, any time, any place, we are willing to meet with them and talk about how we get back into a negotiation,” Esper told reporters.He added that European plans to coordinate naval escorts for oil tankers transiting the strait of Hormuz were “complementary” to the US proposal, dubbed Operational Sentinel. “The Brits are escorting their ships, and we will escort our ships to the degree the risk demands it and I assume other countries will escort their ships.”A study suggested the seizure was legal under Gibraltarian law, but only as a result of regulations passed on 3 July – the day before the seizure – which gave the first minister the power to designate a ship for seizure if it is in breach of EU regulations on sanctions against Syria.The study by Michelle Linderman, a partner at Crowell \u0026amp Moring’s international trade group, said the sanctions applied only if the ship was in Gibraltarian waters at the time of the seizure.Rouhani’s possible olive branch on a ship swap came as part of a broader set of remarks containing Iran’s familiar mixture of threats and assertions of its willingness to negotiate.But in a sign that the crisis could potentially escalate quickly given the many layers of Iranian politics, Iranian officials quoted by Al Jazeera claimed the United Arab Emirates was being turned into operations headquarters for the US after an attempt at regional mediation failed.Hossein Dehqan, an adviser to the Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, claimed all US military bases and pieces in the region would be directly targeted if Washington took the decision to go to war, stressing that any American war against his country meant that the US would face Iran and its allies throughout the region.He said any change in the situation of the strait of Hormuz would increase tension and could open the door to a dangerous confrontation.In his cabinet remarks, Rouhani vowed to take a third step away from the Iran nuclear deal unless progress was made in its demands for greater European efforts to lift the economic pressure placed on Tehran by the US. “We will surely take the third step,” he said. Iran has already breached permitted uranium enrichment levels and stocks in minor but clear violations of the agreement signed in 2015, but from which the US has unilaterally withdrawn.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.He also warned against any British-led attempt to form an international coalition to protect shipping in the Gulf, saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards were responsible for security in the strait of Hormuz.The response comes after Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and France on Tuesday backed the UK’s proposal for a European naval force to protect shipping in the Gulf, which would be distinct from any US maritime security operation.Germany said it was still studying the plans. “We are taking part intensively in these talks, but the conceptional deliberations are just beginning. It is too early today to talk about the form of possible German support or participation,” a government spokesman said.In practice, the proposals will probably await a policy decision from the new prime minister and his foreign secretary.The announcement of Boris Johnson’s premiership was greeted with concern by both reformist and conservative newspapers in Tehran, many of them calling him the “British Trump”, as the banner headline of the reformist Sazandegi read over a full-page picture of Johnson celebrating his win.The conservative newspaper Jaam-e Jam noted Johnson had spoken of regime change in Iran, but added he had said he would not join a US-led war against Iran.The reformist Etemaad’s headline read “Elected by hardliners”, warning Johnson wanted to get close to the US president. But the newspaper added: “Every day you can expect a fascinating event in the UK. Britain’s policy is a surprise to anyone following it every day.”The conservative Resalat published a cartoon of Johnson in the manner of a British butler, being patted on the head by Trump at his desk in the Oval Office, claiming the hardliners were coming to power throughout Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac27f8c4dfcb2cdcd092d2f7ed9a23d6ba88586/0_137_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3839d1ad12f76319bd478a3ccc5f74fa","title":"salvini avoids questions over league links to russian money","story":"Absent from parliament, Italy’s deputy PM says his party did not ask for or take moneyItaly’s deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini has avoided an interrogation in parliament over claims his far-right League party sought money from Russia.In Salvini’s absence, the allegations were addressed by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who said no evidence had emerged to diminish the trust he had “in all members of the government”.Reports earlier this month claimed one of Salvini’s aides had endeavoured to strike an oil deal in a Moscow hotel that would have erted Russian funds to the League to bolster its campaigning before the European elections in May.There is no evidence a deal was finalised, but the allegations, which emerged in February, led prosecutors in Milan to open an investigation and raised questions about the relationship between the League and the Kremlin.Conte said: “We do not know the data or the possible consequences of the Milan probe.”Salvini did not attend parliament but, in a Facebook Live video on Wednesday, he reiterated his party “didn’t ask for or take money from anyone”.He added: “The rest is fantasy. Let everyone else talk, I’m here to work and deal with real problems … Security, immigration, the mafia … not spying.”Many senators from the League’s coalition partner, the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), were also absent from parliament in protest at Conte agreeing to unblock work on a high-speed rail project linking Italy and France.The matter still needs to go to a vote in parliament, but Conte’s approval was a win for the League, which wants the long-stalled TAV project to go ahead, and a setback for M5S, which is vehemently opposed.In a statement, a group of M5S senators also attributed their no-show to the fact Salvini should have been in parliament to respond to the Russia claims.The opposition Democratic Party said it would present a motion of no confidence in Salvini in response to the minister’s refusal to face parliament over the allegations.Prof Mattia Diletti of Sapienza University in Rome said: “Salvini knows that Italian people don’t care too much about the Russiagate. He also knows if he answers to parliament, it would be negative for him. But he really doesn’t care about institutional etiquette, he only cares about communication and consensus.”Salvini has been nurturing ties with Russia since he became leader of the League in 2013 and has always made a show of his admiration for Vladimir Putin.M5S is also Russia-friendly and in the past has faced accusations of being influenced by the Kremlin. Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader, welcomed Putin alongside Salvini during the Russian leader’s state visit to Rome on 4 July. Conte promised Putin Italy would work towards helping mend Moscow’s fractured relations with the EU.Russiagate aside, there are other issues threatening the governing coalition’s survival. The two partners have been at odds for months, with Salvini and Di Maio often trading insults and ultimately stalling progress on government policy. Speculation of an imminent government collapse was rife last week when Salvini declared he had lost all confidence in M5S after the party backed Ursula von der Leyen to become president of the European commission.The League opposed the German candidate, snubbing an instruction from Conte for both parties to vote for her. Salvini accused M5S of betraying its promise to ordinary voters of bringing about radical change in Europe.Salvini and Di Maio had patched things up by Monday but there is pressure on Salvini from within his party’s ranks to seize on his popularity and pull the plug on an administration that some League ministers say has become untenable.Salvini has put the onus on the weakened M5S, threatening to quit unless it drops its opposition towards key League policies such as granting greater fiscal autonomy to the Lombardy and Veneto regions, the party’s strongholds.Jubilant over Conte’s support for the TAV project, Salvini said in his Facebook video that “the government is back on track” after it also agreed to unlock €50bn (£45bn) of investment in other infrastructure projects including roads, hospitals and schools.Most analysts expect the government to make it at least as far as drafting its 2020 budget in the autumn, with a potential cabinet reshuffle taking place to ease tensions in the meantime. Salvini has called for the M5S transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, and the defence minister, Elisabetta Trenta, to go."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3966326.1563991161!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"geriatrician calls for heatwave response plan for the elderly","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Desmond O’Neill says attention to hydration and making sure people have adequate access to proper drinking water needs to increase. Photograph: Georges GobetAFPTemperature control for hospitals and nursing homes will become an urgent priority as temperatures increase due to climate change, a leading geriatrician has said.In its 2019 annual review, the climate advisory council said rising carbon emissions would result in increased extreme weather events such as the heatwave in summer 2018 and Storm Emma in March 2018.The council raised concerns about how increasing temperatures will affect patients in hospitals as a result of the “nature of the hospital building stock”.“Older people generally have less reserve,” Prof O’Neill said. “Their ability to bounce back from traumas, injuries, etc is reduced. This reduced reserve becomes more pronounced in frail, older people because there’s less fat stores, there’s less spring in their tendons, there’s less reserve in their kidneys.”Prof O’Neill said there was a range of measures that would need to be implemented to ensure the lives of elderly people were not at risk due to rising temperatures.“Public health nurses will need increased vigilance during this time and, in particular, the attention to hydration and making sure people have adequate access to proper drinking water needs to increase,” he said.“Currently in hospitals, there is quite a challenge with using fans from an infection-control point of view. Looking at climate control for hospitals and nursing homes will become an urgent priority. Just like people get grants for insulation for their homes, I think soon people will be looking for grants for air conditioning for their homes,” he added.Education planProf O’Neill also recommended that the country establishes a heatwave response plan, a public education plan and the establishment of an outreach programme to high-risk iniduals.Nursing Homes Ireland, a representative body, has issued guidelines to more than 300 nursing homes to ensure that elderly residents are protected from any risks associated with increased temperatures.“Electric fans may provide some relief, if temperatures are below 35C,” a resource issued by the body to nursing homes said. “Use of fans at temperatures above 35C fans may not prevent heat-related illness.”The pamphlet added: “Additionally fans can cause excess dehydration the advice is to place the fan at an appropriate distance from people, not aiming it directly on the body and to have regular drinks this is especially important in the case of sick people confined to bed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoI don\u0026rsquot think he\u0026rsquos any time for Northern Ireland at all,\u0026rsquo says football fanWheelchair users upset and exhausted by constant breakdown of lifts at train stationsLabour Court rules worker may sue Kuwaiti Cultural Office under Unfair Dismissals ActTemperature control to become a priority for nursing homes and hospitalsMinisters to discuss drug cautions, night culture scheme and childcare at final meetingIreland remains \u0026lsquocompletely off course\u0026rsquo to achieve key carbon reduction targets by 2020 and 2030Research Lives: Prof Emma Teeling, UCD school of biology and environmental scienceThere are numerous beneficial outcomes to living near greenery, especially if there are treesInspector finds \u0026lsquocontinuing breaches of human rights\u0026rsquo including lack of privacyDr Mary Moloney \u0026lsquoshocked\u0026rsquo at poor safety procedures highlighted by RT\u0026Eacute documentaryCompany filings show Dubliner Anne Davy\u0026rsquos Hyde \u0026amp Seek is a profitable creche chainCreche owner says parents should know their rights and ask questionsRT\u0026Eacute reporter found crowding, poorly trained staff, cheap meals and instances of poor careFormer Northern secretary says it was a \u0026lsquoprivilege\u0026rsquo to represent this \u0026lsquospecial nation\u0026rsquoSinn F\u0026eacutein\u0026rsquos McDonald seeks meeting with British prime minister \u0026lsquoin the coming days\u0026rsquoAccuser seeking damages from Christian Brothers, Scouting Ireland of up to \u0026euro1.4mGreenhouse gas emissions from sector continue to rise alongside cattle numbersBrian Bridgeman told garda\u0026iacute he woke up in church crypt and didn\u0026rsquot know where he wasNew prime minister urged to take a \u0026lsquohands-on role\u0026rsquo to reinstate Stormont"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3966512.1564001599!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"howzat england bowled out by ireland on boris s first day as pm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Ireland fan celebrates as England are bowled out before lunch during day one of the  Test match between England and Ireland at Lord’s Cricket Ground on in London on Wednesday. Photograph: Stu ForsterGetty ImagesBoris Johnson was promising no quarter on Brexit a few miles away in Downing Street, but at Lord’s cricket ground in St John’s Wood in North London, it was the Irish cricket team who offered lessons to their English counterparts in the first-ever Test between the sides.The atmosphere at England v Ireland sporting fixtures is usually defined by intense rivalry. But fans of both countries filtered into the ground together in good spirits, sharing jokes and suncream in the blistering 30-degree heat.However, the English good humour was challenged by a magnificent Irish bowling display, which left them 85 all-out before lunch. Taken aback by the morning’s developments, BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew told BBC Radio 4’s Test Match Special: “Ireland lead England by 80 on the first day of a Test match. It has been the most bizarre day.”In a delicious irony, the Daily , which has claimed the occasional Irish Oscar-winning actor as “British”, was left to claim “Lambeth-born Tim Murtagh” after the Irish bowler had taken five wickets for just 13 runs – the second-lowest result ever claimed by a bowler of any country against England.Raised in EnglandUnlike the English World Cup-winning captain, Irishman Eoin Morgan, James Murtagh, born in 1981, was raised in England. The left-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler represented England in the 2000 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He played for the Surrey county team from 2000 to 2006, then moved to Middlesex, where he has played since.Murtagh first played for Ireland in 2012. Six years later, he was one of the eleven cricketers to play in Ireland’s first Test match, against Pakistan. Eighteen months ago, he was named the Men’s International Player of the Year at the annual Cricket Ireland Awards.The Irish mood in the stands brightened and brightened as the day went on. “Now there’s a happy face! My grandmother is 100 this week, she’s a big Cricket fan and we have brought her to Lords to see the first ever IrelandEngland Test. And what a start by @Irelandcricket,” tweeted Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney on a rare day away from dealing with Brexit.On the ropesHe was not the only Irish Government Minister in the stands. Minister for Sport Shane Ross, a noted cricket fan of many years’ standing, declared on Twitter that the English were on the ropes.The Irish in Britain were there, too, including Timothy Hart, whose parents hail from Macroom, Co Cork, who had travelled from Southampton. “Having been brought up in England, I never thought I’d see Ireland play at Lord’s in my lifetime. It’s absolutely fantastic.”Ireland went on to take a 122-run first innings lead at Lord’s."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3966274.1563988015!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet set to approve island investment plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Kyne will chair a group   to form a strategy for Ireland’s 30 populated islands. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill The Cabinet is set to approve a new investment plan for Ireland’s 30 populated islands, the first such plan since 1996.Government Ministers will hold their final Cabinet meeting of the term in Donegal on Thursday and will discuss plans for a new caution system for the personal possession of drugs, a new “night culture” scheme, the childcare sector and the new islands plan.Departments will be asked to nominate an inidual to sit on a new group which will form a strategy for Irish islands with the group being chaired by the Minister of State in the Department of Taoiseach Seán Kyne.The new plan aims to support the social, cultural and economic development of inhabited offshore islands to ensure that they can survive as viable communities.About 30 such islands are populated, eight of which are in the Gaeltacht. These are generally the most populated islands.The new group will look at issues around the provision of housing and the delivery of education and health. It will also look at employment opportunities on the islands. The all-of-Government group will devise an implementation plan. Legislation may be necessary for the new plan, it is understood.Drug possessionMinister of State for Drugs strategy Catherine Byrne will also bring a memo to Government on changes to the legal system in relation to the personal possession of drugs. She will present a report by an expert group that recommends potential first and second cautions to those caught with a small amount of drugs.She will also bring a memo alongside the report containing a series of proposals which it is expected Government Ministers will accept before the new policy is launched next week.Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan is also expected to bring a memo on “night-time culture”.She has previously indicated that the issue of licensing times as well as the introduction of night mayors is under examination as part of an attempt to enhance night-time culture in Ireland.Meanwhile, the Minister for Business Heather Humphreys\u0026nbspwill host a Brexit-readiness workshop in Donegal to help small and medium enterprises from the county as well as the surrounding Border counties of Sligo and Leitrim.She will be asking businesses to look at their supply chains, customs procedures, certification, and standards and licensing processes.“We cannot assume that because a no-deal scenario was avoided in March and April, the same will happen again in October.

dose of the reality show turn around the broadcaster’s fortunes?Click to followThe IndependentLove Island\u0026nbsphas sure helped to fuel a lust for ITV\u0026nbspshares.\u0026nbspFor a day, at least, the company was among the stock market’s hottest contestants, the one investors wanted to couple up with, aided\u0026nbspby the announcement that we’re about to be treated to a double dose of the smash-hit reality show next year.\u0026nbspSmart move. It highlights the the company’s key strength. It still has the capability to deliver mass\u0026nbspaudiences to advertisers in a way that’s almost unique. Love Island is beloved by the\u0026nbspmuch\u0026nbspcoveted 16- to 34-year-old\u0026nbspdemographic that is usually\u0026nbspin thrall to Netflix and YouTube. There’s nothing currently about that rivals the show’s\u0026nbsppopularity among its members.\u0026nbspITV boss criticises ‘simplifying link’ between Love Island and suicideLove Island to air twice in 2020 as winter series announced by ITV2Love Island: Counselling offered to contestants’ families by ITVBut Love Island also highlights the company’s weakness. Without it, where would ITV be?\u0026nbspOK, that’s a little unfair. There’s more to the company than just its most high-profile show.\u0026nbspThe main reason for the company’s shares taking flight was, in fact, because its results weren’t anything like as bad as the City had feared, and the company’s guidance had prepped it for.\u0026nbspBut despite Love Island and other hit shows, ad revenues were still down\u0026nbspby 5 per cent, ditto overall revenues, off by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe latter was in part because the money that its content producer ITV Studios brings in comes in fits and starts. There’ll be a lot more of it in the second half this year.The ads were partly down because of the UK’s awful political situation, but ITV still faces the long-term problem of them shifting online, taking its biggest revenue stream with them. It’s a process that looks set to carry on\u0026nbspeven if the broadcaster continues to find hits such as the aforementioned reality show or Bodyguard, or its other winning properties.To be fair, CEO Carolyn McCall has been actively pursuing ways to address the issue and ITV Digital’s offerings have done well on her watch. It delivered an 18 per cent rise in turnover this time around.\u0026nbspThere’s also the forthcoming BritBox streaming venture, in partnership with the BBC.\u0026nbspIt’s already in the US, where it has been doing well. ITV is now putting a great deal of effort into launching it on this side of the pond.\u0026nbspBut there are questions. The £5.99 monthly price tag is competitive (although the initially rumoured £5 might have ultimately delivered still more subscribers), and it is marketing distinctively British content.\u0026nbspBut it will, at least at first, be reliant on back catalogue, at a time when its partner is looking to extend the free iPlayer window to a year.\u0026nbspThe latter’s stake is only 10 per cent, with an option to raise it. That looks like a less than wholehearted commitment that could easily be jettisoned.\u0026nbspNetflix has become a juggernaut through investing billions in new content – as much as $15bn a year. Britbox is getting £65m over two (although that’s net of forecast subscriptions), and there’ll be no standalone shows at launch. Does it have enough to secure a niche as an additional extra, a second streaming subscription, which is the pitch, amid an increasingly crowded field?\u0026nbspIt’s worthy of note that Netflix is finding resistance from consumers to its price rises. They only have so much to spend.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

But there are plenty of other reasons that employees might feel welcome\u0026nbsphere, from the breakout areas populated by stuffed Shaun the Sheep, to the well-tended\u0026nbspgardens, where Nick Park often sits, pondering his latest creations, to the walls and cabinets lined with Baftas, Oscars and Cannes Lions for Wallace and Gromit and many of the other Aardman creations that are printed\u0026nbspin the memory of any British child of the Nineties.\u0026nbspLast year, those employees had one more reason to stay. On 10 November\u0026nbsp2018, the company announced that its founders, Peter Lord and Dave\u0026nbspSproxton, were selling 75 per cent of shares to a trust that would hold them on behalf of employees, turning Aardman into an employee-owned company.Stephanie Owen, a senior producer and trustee director, first heard about the plan at the company’s annual review in April last year. She had plenty of questions about employee ownership, which is still less well known than other company structures, but mostly, she felt proud.\u0026nbsp“I felt incredibly emotional and rather proud to be part of a company where the owners were taking such a bold and generous step to ensure the company’s legacy continued in the hands of the people who care so much about it –\u0026nbspthe partners, as we are now all called,” Owen\u0026nbspremembers.How one cooperative is improving lives with food in PrestonWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK’s social care crisisThere are now more than 370 employee-owned businesses in the UK and 200,000 employee-owners. The sector is still small, but has grown rapidly since the 2012 Nuttall review by the government, which encouraged the creation of employee-owned businesses as a way to ersify industry\u0026nbspafter the financial crisis.\u0026nbspAfter the Nuttall review, the government created two types of tax relief for employee-owned businesses. The first offers relief from capital gains tax for company owners\u0026nbspwho decide to sell their business to an employee-ownership trust. The second provides an income tax exemption for employees, allowing them to receive a tax-free bonus of up to £3,600 annually.This week, the Employee Ownership Association and Co-operatives UK joined together to call on the government to invest £2m\u0026nbspin the spending review to support the voluntary expansion of employee and worker-owned businesses.\u0026nbspThey point to evidence that shows that as UK productivity has declined, the productivity of the top employee-owned firms is rising by 7 per cent a year. Ed Mayo, secretary general of Co-operatives UK, says: “When it comes to reducing wealth inequality, driving employee engagement and tackling regional resilience, employee and worker ownership offers a proven solution.”Upstairs at Aardman, Dave Sproxton keeps a business book on his desk that partly inspired his decision: Beyond the Corporation: Humanity Working\u0026nbspby David Erdal, the chair of Tullis Russell, a paper manufacturing company based in Scotland. Erdal designed and led the employee buyout of the company, which was completed in 1994.Sproxton had been thinking and talking about succession plans for Aardman since 2013. The seeds of his interest in employee ownership were\u0026nbspsown much earlier when, as a geography undergraduate, he studied under a Marxist professor. “The tendency of\u0026nbspa company like ours with intellectual property of value is to get swallowed by Endemol, Disney or somewhere, who then take the properties and make them in another country,” he says. “About five employees go with them and the rest find themselves out of a job.”Sproxton dismissed the idea of becoming a cooperative, which gives every worker an equal share in the business, believing that it might not work in such a commercial environment. He landed on employee ownership through a trust, which is managed separately through a board. This model does not convey the same voting rights as full cooperative ownership, but can make employees a more active part of managing the business. “The culture of the place was already collaborative, as film-making is, so when an employee-ownership structure was mooted, I thought that could be a way forward,” he says.Aardman Animations at 40Now the transfer of shares is complete, Sproxton is focussing his attention on appointing a new managing director to replace him, so that he can move into a consultancy role. Meanwhile Peter Lord will remain creative director, working on a Shaun the Sheep movie due out later this year and Chicken Run 2, which is in development.“We’re not quitting yet,” the founders said in the statement announcing the new company structure. “But we are preparing for our future. This approach is the best solution we have found for keeping Aardman doing what it does best, keeping the teams in place and providing continuity for our highly creative culture. And of course, those that create value in the company will continue to benefit directly from the value they create.”Since the transition, Stephanie Owen has been elected by her colleagues to represent them at the executive board and the trustee board. The role is a step up from the previous workers’ council and has given employees more of a hand in shaping the business – including helping to choose a successor to\u0026nbspSproxton as managing director. “There is a new air of excitement and positive energy that the EO transition has brought,” Owen says. “There is also a sense of responsibility in the knowledge that ‘it’s our Aardman’ now and we all have a part to play in making it the best it can be.”wallis and gromit\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A phone known as D42 will replace the iPhone XS, one known as D43 will replace the iPhone XS Max, and one called N104 will come in the place of the iPhone XR.Last year was the first time Apple released its iPhones in this line-up, with a large and small version of the premium model and then a cheaper medium-sized version. That same set-up looks set to be in place this year, according to the leak.Perhaps the most notable feature of the new phone is what won\u0027t change. The new phones are said to feature a Lightning port like the existing phones, rather than swapping to the USB-C that arrived on the iPad Pro last year and has long been rumoured to be coming to kill off the Lightning port as a charger.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

That will be a large block of lenses that will feature three cameras arranged into a square shape.iPhone users urged to update old devices to latest iOS softwareThe third lens – a first for the iPhone – will include a new lens that will be able to take wide-angle photos, the report suggested. As well as letting people take wider photos, that will allow for a new feature called Smart Frame which will capture data outside of a traditional photo so that users can change the framing of it by using that same data.The front-facing camera will also receive an upgrade.They will also kill off one major feature, known as 3D Touch, which allowed people to press their phone screen harder and get new menu options. That was introduced on the iPhone 6s but never came to the iPads or the iPhone XR, and the new phones will also drop it – making way for similar tools that will be enabled by software, the report claimed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But that does not stop it being any more frustrating when it does.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakWhen phones do shut down, they will show an error message that tells their user that the phone won\u0027t work until it has cooled down again.iPhones are made\u0026nbspto operate between zero and 35-degrees Celsius. That measure refers to the temperature around the phone, however, rather than the phone itself – meaning that they may shut down more quickly even if the ambient temperature is lower, and might not do so immediately even when the weather is a little hotter.If a phone is left out in the sun, for instance, it will get warm much more quickly and might shut down. And by the same measure, if it is able to cool in a hot room by being left out on a cold surface, it might be able to keep running even when the outside temperature would appear to be too hot.The phones can also be stored in places that are up to 45-degrees celsius, according to Apple. But they can\u0027t be\u0026nbspused\u0026nbspat that temperature, only kept there.Cooling a phone down to make it start working again can be done just like any other object: put it somewhere cool, move it out of direct sunlight, and in extreme cases you can hold it next to something cold like a bottle of water. It can also be useful to take it out of its case, since they can store up the heat and work like a blanket wrapped around it.But it can also be helpful to stop it getting that warm in the first place. That can be done by keeping it out of direct heat, but also minimising the amount of work it is doing on the inside – avoiding intensive processes like playing games, downloading files, and other taxing activities.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But why not use this technology to save today’s struggling ecosystems and habitats,\u0026nbspasks Ashley Coates\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFew people enjoying a walk on Scotland’s coast today know that it is missing a fascinating animal:\u0026nbspa charismatic, large, flightless seabird that is Britain’s very own dodo.\u0026nbspIn July 1840, Britain’s last great auks were killed on the island of St Kilda. Having been captured alive, the islanders decided the birds were witches that had brought on a storm and they were promptly stoned to death.The demise of the auk is one of the saddest episodes in the history of our interactions with nature. The auks went from flocks of millions to a single breeding pair, caught by Icelandic fishermen in June 1844, when the very last egg was accidentally crushed in the effort to capture and kill the adults.\u0026nbspOur guilt over the violent end of such an impressive species is one of the reasons the auks are a candidate for de-extinction, and why de-extinction has such a strong appeal in general.The idea of bringing back any species from the dead elicits reactions of excitement at the chance to see live animals we thought we had lost forever and perhaps the opportunity to right the wrongs inflicted by mankind on the natural world. Having caused the demise of these animals ourselves, usually through hunting or habitat loss, surely it is our duty to restore them and in-so-doing the ecosystems they used to inhabit?Yet de-extinction has always been met with a certain amount of queasiness about what the restoration of an extinct species would mean for nature and for our place within it. The moral implications seem uncertain. With humans now determining the weather, the rate of habitat loss, and with it the rate of extinction, are we already influencing evolutionary processes enough without bringing animals back from the dead?Do we need to have herds of mammoths wandering around today and how can we expect them to survive in a world where their habitats are shrinking and so many living species are at risk of extinction?Antón)Twenty-six years on from the original Jurassic Park, the arguments against reviving extinct species have not changed since Ian Malcolm, the maverick mathematician played by Jeff Goldblum, chastised theme park owner John Hammond for bringing back the dinosaurs.\u0026nbsp“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u0027t stop to think if they should,” he says.What has changed is our real-life capability to bring back the long-lost species that have died under our watch, creatures like the auk, the woolly mammoth and the passenger pigeon. Some scientists working on “resurrection biology” believe we may be as little as a decade away from bringing back some of these icons of extinction.Unfortunately for fans of the Jurassic Park franchise, nobody is expecting to see a tyrannosaur roaming around a Costa Rican island any time soon. In Michael Crichton’s book (and later in the 1993 film), dinosaur blood preserved inside a mosquito that had become encased in amber was the source of the DNA needed to create the dinosaurs that featured in the theme park.Gerrard Keulemans)There has been a mosquito found in 45-million-year-old lake sediments which retained haemoglobin-derived porphyrins – products from the breakdown of haemoglobin, lending at least a degree of credence to the fiction. Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million–year-old dinosaur specimens were reported by palaeontologists back in 2015 and scientists continue to look for remnants of living matter in dinosaur bones.Just last month, scientists from the renowned Field Museum in Chicago found modern living microbes “having a jolly good time” inside the bones of a 75-million-year-old centrosaurus, but this discovery further supports the consensus that it will be hard for proteins and DNA material to survive the ravages of time. Despite an array of fascinating finds, the oldest DNA found so far was around one million years old, fully 65 million years after the last of the dinosaurs.Even with the possibility of elements of blood cells, collagen or other organic matter being preserved in the fossil record, the chances of finding intact DNA are remote. DNA breaks down over time, particularly after exposure to water, meaning it is extremely unlikely if not impossible that a full or partial genome from anything living before 65 million years ago would still be around today.But there are a number of more recently extinct species that are up for consideration as candidates for de-extinction, including some of T Rex’s closest modern relatives.Revive and Restore, a US non-profit working exclusively to bring back a number of lost species, is focusing efforts on the passenger pigeon, a once common North American bird that dramatically disappeared at the beginning of the last century.The idea that the passenger pigeon might go extinct would have seemed extraordinary to the Americans who once spoke of flocks of many millions blocking out the sky as the pigeons migrated across the north eastern United States. Writing in 1813, the celebrated American ornithologist, John James Audubon, told his readers: “The light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse, the dung fell in spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow and the continued buzz of wings had a tendency to lull my senses to repose.”Each of these great migrations coincided with a mass shooting of the birds, both for food and for feathers.\u0026nbspThe speed with which the passenger pigeon then went extinct was phenomenal. Scientists now believe the species was prone to “cycles of boom and bust” without human interference but even so, reducing a population of around three billion to zero within a few decades is remarkable even by the standards of today’s extinctions. September 1914. The last wild passenger pigeon is believed to have been shot 13 years earlier.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe approach being developed by Ben Novak and the team at Revive and Restore is to take the genome of the passenger pigeon’s closest living relative, the band-tailed pigeon, and insert characteristics from the genome of the extinct passenger pigeon, a process that could be applied to a wide range of lost species.\u0026nbsp What you end up with is not a fully restored passenger pigeon, but a hybrid version of the two species, a band-tailed pigeon which looks and acts like a passenger pigeon.According to Tom Maloney, Revive and Restore’s director of conservation science:\u0026nbsp“You find a species that is the closest living relative and then conduct a process of comparative genomics to find where the traits are that need to be changed.\u0026nbspWe can find the traits for the red breast, or the long tail, what is not known is how much behaviour was learned, how much was culture within the species, and those are some of the tangible issues that are still uncertain”.The return of a particularly significant species such as\u0026nbspthe passenger pigeon could have benefits for other species. Where a habitat has lost an animal or plant that was important for the way the ecosystem functioned, the very act of bringing them back may also result in the restoration, or stabilisation of, the ecosystems that are currently missing them.“We are moving away from the idea that you are bringing back a woolly mammoth in its entirety,” Tom Maloney says, “and more towards modifying the Asian elephant to fill the ecological niche left by the woolly mammoth 10,000 years ago”.We are moving away from the idea that you are bringing back a woolly mammoth in its entirety, and more towards modifying the Asian elephant to fill the ecological niche left by the woolly mammoth 10,000 years ago“What we and the IUCN\u0026nbsp{International Union for the Conservation of Nature} bring to this is a thoughtful consideration of the factors that led to extinction, and more importantly the functional role of the animal in the ecosystem, such as restoring mammoths to the permafrost or passenger pigeons to the forests of North America.”Critics of de-extinction point to the need to focus our efforts on saving animals that are alive today but what has emerged out of the work led by Revive and Restore is the potential to use gene editing techniques to save today’s vulnerable species. If you can modify a band-tailed pigeon to look like a passenger pigeon, why not use the same technology to modify coral to survive temperature changes as the seas continue to warm, or amphibians to survive the fungal disease that is currently decimating their populations in South America?Helen Pilcher,\u0026nbspauthor of Bring Back the King: the New Science of De-extinction, highlights the northern white rhino as the sort of species that could benefit from this approach. Functionally extinct, the last male northern white rhino died in 2014, leaving only two females. Techniques such as those being developed by Revive and Restore could provide the means to prevent the rhinos from being lost forever.de-extintion\u0026nbspto species that need it, like the white rhino (AFPGetty)“You can call it de-extinction or you can call it conservation, but I think it is two sides of the same coin. I certainly think we should consider bringing back fully extinct species, but in the first instance it should be applied to species that really need our help like the black-footed ferret or the kakapo, or the northern white rhino.”“I am very much in favour of Revive and Restore’s attitude, that we have this emerging suite of technologies which we can apply to species which are essentially extinct if we don’t come up with new technologies. That for me is the most exciting part of this work.”This form of gene editing is now emerging as the most viable, or at least the most discussed, means to “de-extinct” a species. Elsewhere in the world, researchers have managed to employ different techniques and with encouraging results.Lydekker)In 2003, Jose Folch and his team at the centre for Agro-Nutrition Research and Technology (Spain), became the first people in the world to successfully recover a lost species after they cloned cells from the skin of the last of the bucardos, also known as the Pyrenean ibex. A sub-species of the Spanish ibex, the bucardos suffered from years of hunting before the last of its kind tragically died after a tree fell on it. The DNA of this female animal was inserted into the eggs of domestic goats before being implanted into the wombs of the goats and a few female Spanish ibexes.Fully 208 ibex were implanted with embryos, seven became pregnant and one successfully delivered a new-born bucardo, which died of respiratory failure after only a few minutes. Despite this setback, the project was considered a success in the field and remains the only time an extinct species has been brought back to life, albeit very briefly.Gone and back againOsprey: one of the most impressive bird species in the UK, the osprey went extinct in England in 1840 and in Scotland in 1916. This was largely as a result of the Victorian interest in egg collecting, taxidermy and plumage. Today\u0027s birds are the result of both naturally colonising breeding pairs and re-introduced birds.\u0026nbspGreat bustard: the world\u0027s heaviest flying bird was hunted to extinction in England in 1832. The Great Bustard Group has\u0026nbspbeen releasing hundreds of bustard chicks on to Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire since 2004 and it is hoped that the population will be increased to sustainable levels.\u0026nbspBeavers: these were hunted to extinction in Britain in the 16th century, for pelts and a prized oil they secrete. In 2009 they were reintroduced in Scotland, and a trial to manage beavers on the River Otter in Devon is underway.Hen-harrier: the government has launched a hen-harrier action plan to protect the final few pairs breeding in England, where it is feared they will be persecuted to extinction. Conservationists are using satellite monitoring and 24-hour nest protection.Wild boar have twice been made extinct outside of captivity in Britain – the result of over-hunting in the 13th and 17th centuries. Escapees from farms have repopulated the Forest of Dean, while release programmes have had success elsewhere.Unlike the passenger pigeon or the bucardo, the keepers at Amsterdam Zoo did not know they had the very last of the quaggas until after its death in 1883. For an animal that was once so numerous, the surviving remnants of their kind are remarkably sparse. There are only three photographs of a live quagga, which\u0026nbsplived at London Zoo’s Regent’s Park site. Around 23 skins remain preserved as taxidermy worldwide.It is one of the oddities of our relationship with nature in the past two centuries that an animal which would have been common just a few generations ago is now mostly unheard of while its surviving relatives are among\u0026nbspsome of the best known and most loved animals globally.\u0026nbspA sub-species of the plains zebra, the quagga looked almost identical to modern zebras, apart from their stripes, which appear to run out before they got to its hind legs.On a genetic level, they are so similar to their surviving cousins that an innovative South African project is working to restore the species through a process known as “back breeding”. As the name suggests, this involves repeatedly breeding plains zebras that exhibit the characteristics of the quagga (most notably the lack of hind stripes) until you have an animal that at least resembles the quagga to the best of our knowledge.More than 30 years into The Quagga Project, the latest Rau Quagga in the breeding programme, an animal known as Rachel, certainly looks like the quagga pictured in Victorian era-London Zoo.\u0026nbspWhichever technique is employed by scientists, de-extinction has always been looked upon with a certain amount of scepticism.\u0026nbspSince the publication of her book, Bring Back the King, Helen Pilcher has found she receives a mixed reaction when she delivers talks about the techniques used by scientists in this area.\u0026nbsp“The knee-jerk reaction of a lot of people is that scientists are playing God,” she says, “that we are taking things too far, and we should be putting money into conservation.”“If the playing God argument is that we are choosing which species can live and which can die then we have been doing that for, arguably, thousands of years. It is just that we are doing it on a bigger and much more devastating scale now.\u0026nbspYou could take the view that we are already playing God by raising the temperature of the planet, acidifying the oceans, and controlling evolution through the breeding of certain animals.”Our awareness of the bioersity crash we are bringing about is now at an all-time high. Last month, a major UN report suggested one million animal and eight million plant species are at risk of extinction, and as many as 20 species are going extinct every day.\u0026nbspThe animals that could be lost include many species that\u0026nbspsurvived the last mass extinction events: deep sea sharks, which\u0026nbsphave patrolled the abyss largely unchanged for hundreds of millions of years\u0026nbspturtles, once one of the most common large animals in the ocean are now icons of the conservation movement.Yet a surprising twist on the development of this technology in the past few years has been its potential application as a means of saving today\u0027s wildlife, both by reintroducing lost animals into fragile ecosystems, and by modifying the genomes of living species to improve their resilience. Pilcher says:\u0026nbsp“We have been altering the genes of animals for a long time and now we are in a position to speed up that process. We are changing the evolutionary trajectory of every creature on the planet. Scientists can now look at ecosystems and identify what is missing and restore that element.What animal would you bring back if you could? For me I thought it would be something like the dodo or the woolly mammoth because who wouldn’t want to see one? But in the end the animal I would most like to see de-extinct is one that is still alive, and it is the northern white rhino“I am in favour of developing the technology at least until\u0026nbspthe point where we can establish how useful it will be, but I don’t think we are there yet.”It is the application of technology directly that troubles some, perhaps because there is something unnerving about “meddling” with nature’s intended path.\u0026nbspThe rebuttal to that –\u0026nbspwhich is that we are already altering the course of life on Earth anyway, and gene editing is just another way of doing the same thing –\u0026nbspis an uncomfortable idea to accept. Many of us take solace in nature because of its seeming constancy, and apparent separateness from our own lives, and coming to terms with the extent of human influence in natural processes is difficult. Nevertheless, all the scientists in the field advocate a cautious approach to what is still very much a frontier science.Another criticism of de-extinction is the perception that it is a fringe science obsessed with the restoration of animals like the mammoth and the auk, for the wow factor as much as anything else, but it’s the potential of using this technology to save today’s struggling ecosystems that has emerged has perhaps the most useful application of the science, if and when it comes to fruition.“The most convincing argument for de-extinction is that we look at it as a tool of conservation,” says\u0026nbspPilcher.“I started my last book with the question: what animal would you bring back if you could? For me I thought it would be something like the dodo or the woolly mammoth because it would be amazing and who wouldn’t want to see one? But in the end the animal I would most like to see de-extinct is one that is still alive, and it is the northern white rhino.”The technology is still being perfected but, in the meantime, we need to build a better awareness of how the science can be used to save today’s threatened species and the habitats that depend on them.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are just a few days to go now until Love Island leaves our screens. And after months of nuanced relationship drama, one thing is clear: all the men on this show end up disappointing you.\u0026nbspFirst there was Michael, who dumped Amber for Joanna, then Curtis dumped his half-girlfriend Amy, who left the villa in a sorry state, and now Jordan. Despite being one of the few seemingly kind, unproblematic Islanders, Jordan still barely thought twice about dumping Anna for someone he\u0027d know for three minutes.Tonight, four Islanders were dumped from the villa. I was hoping that Jordan would be among them, and my wish came true. Here are the biggest talking points.Jordan and Anna sever ties“I am a strong woman. I will never let someone bring me down and win.” Jordan’s mind-boggling decision – aided by slimeball of the year Curtis – to attempt to woo India two days after asking Anna to be his girlfriend backfired catastrophically. Thank goodness, then, that Anna had her head screwed on correctly.The day in which the Islanders have to look after fake babies, and thus temporarily lose their heads – behaving like five-year-olds who genuinely believe they’re new parents – is always one of the weirdest days of every series. Last year’s highlight was when Dr Alex (who was otherwise a bit of a wally) accidentally sent his baby flying out of its pram. This year’s was Tommy making his do a backflip and Molly-Mae shouting at him within six milliseconds.That’s it. That’s the talking point.It was a fairly simple, old-school kind of dumping this evening – the public voted for their favourite couples, and the two with the lowest votes were dumped unceremoniously from the island. The first couple was Harley and Chris, who seem like perfectly fine people but whose loss isn’t an immense one. The second was Anna and Jordan, and frankly Jordan deserved to leave enough for the both of them. “I’m so grateful for you three,” Anna told Maura, Molly-Mae and Amber, “because I feel like I found love. If I could do it again, I would, just because I found you guys.”Follow along with the action as it happened below.Catch up with last night\u0027s episode hereLove Island\u0026nbspto air twice in 2020Counselling offered to contestants\u0027 families by ITVGood evening! Who is going to disappoint us on Love Island tonight?\u0026nbspMolly-Mae and Tommy share a strange lick\u0026nbspDuring a romantic catch up with one another, during which Molly-Mae and Tommy told each other repeatedly that they love one another, they then began sharing a very strange nose lick.\u0026nbspWell, time\u0027s a ticking guys, and only one couple is going to win that £50K...\u0026nbspJordan reveals to Curtis that his head has been turned by IndiaAfter considering his feelings overnight, Jordan told\u0026nbspCurtis:\u0026nbspI think I\u0027ve worked out the location of my head. It\u0027s in India. Curtis isn\u0027t one to keep nuggets such as this to himself, so he quickly decides to share it with Maura. Catching up with her on the bean bags, he said: I’ve been speaking with Jordan. Basically, he is a little bit confused. He has feelings for India.\u0026nbspMaura is startled by the information, and then goes over to tell her friend Anna what\u0027s been going on. Yes, prepare for fireworks.\u0026nbspAnna confronts Jordan in explosive end to the episode\u0026nbspAnna finds out from Maura that Jordan\u0027s head has been turned by page 3 model India Reynolds, and yes, she\u0027s furious.\u0026nbspWalking up to Jordan and India, she fumed: You like her? In response, Jordan tried to brush it off, saying, I\u0027m having a conversation with her, then adding, I never said that I like her. Anna was having none of it, though, and she responded: That\u0027s what Maura\u0027s just told me, Anna says. You just asked me out and you like her?! Is that how much of a f***ing\u0026nbspidiot you are?With only days to go in the villa, the pot is definitely getting stirred...\u0026nbspCurtis and Maura go to the Hideaway\u0026nbspCouple Curtis and Maura had the opportunity to spend the night in the Hideaway together, and things got, erm, steamy? Curtis entered the Hideaway wearing a flowery kimono, then donned a feather boa, and the couple hastily made their way to bed. Things got so\u0026nbspsteamy, in fact, that Maura told the girls the next morning that it was fanny-tastic.\u0026nbspYep, it is what it is, guys.\u0026nbspMaura: You walked in here a strong woman, you\u0027re gonna walk out of here a strong woman.Anna: And I\u0027m gonna wake up tomorrow an even stronger woman.\u0026nbspYes, yes, a thousand times yes.\u0026nbspPlease allow the live blog a moment to loadThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To keep him involved, the crew had to head to where the actor was filming his other, bigger projects (hence the season begins with a double episode in London, where he was filming s of the Galaxy). That season also saw Rob Lowe and Rashida Jones leave the show, leading to some patches that were never really covered over. Still, the final episode was still a delight, with Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope meeting Michelle Obama and getting her dream job in Pawnee. But then they made a seventh, completely unnecessary season a few years later… which we should all forget exists.The show that birthed the phrase “jumping the shark”. Season five of Happy Days saw Fonzie literally jumping over a shark – a moment so absurd that critics were left asking whether the writers had run out of material. The moment became the turning point for Happy Days as the quality gradually began to decline, the inclination of which got steeper after Ron Howard left after season seven.Thanks to stellar reviews and enticing advertising, Heroes quickly became one of the most-popular shows on television in 2006. However, while the charming first season – which centred on a group of people coming to terms with their super-human powers – was a fast-paced addictive ride, the second was a meandering mess. The first few episodes contained so much filler that viewers turned off in their droves. Season three fared no better, and by the conclusion of season four only 4.41 million people were still watching – down from the 16.97 million who watched the season two premiere.There was once a time when every winner on The X Factor was pretty much guaranteed a Christmas number one. It became such a monotonous routine in the UK that music lovers protested by getting Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name Of” to the coveted top spot in 2009. Coincidentally, the following years have seen the X Factor’s ratings begin to dwindle, mainly thanks to viewers becoming bored of the same sob stories being wheeled out every year. To fix this, Simon Cowell attempted to switch up the judges at an increased rate, scraping the barrel in 2015 by bringing on Nick Grimshaw (the same year that Dermot O’Leary stepped down as presenter, to be replaced by television’s most awkward duo, Caroline Flack and Olly Murs). Despite Louis Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne (and Dermot) coming back the year after, the damage had already been done.Stars often outgrow their shows. Midway through the fourth season of Community, Donald Glover, who played Troy, left to pursue a music career as the rapper Childish Gambino. Of course, that did not turn out too badly, with Glover now having a few Grammys on his mantelpiece. Unfortunately, Community was never the same without him, and the dominoes kept falling after that. Chevy Chase also left, while Dan Harmon stopped writing for the show. As a result, the final two seasons received awful reviews.Big Brother was a big deal. The first few seasons spawned celebrities and managed to attract millions of viewers. While originally a strange social experiment put on by Channel 4, the show devolved into a middling reality TV series where contestants would do anything to prolong their 15 minutes of fame. When the show moved to Channel 5, it was only another knock on the death knell.The team behind Dallas were so desperate to bring back Patrick Duffy\u0027s character Bobby Ewing that they made the entire ninth season one long dream sequence. Of course, they had initially not known the entire season would be a dream, as Duffy had voluntarily left to pursue other acting jobs. Obviously, things did not go well for the actor, and the writing team put him back into the show – at the expense of viewers, who felt understandably short-changed by the events of 31 episodes being reversed. Note for TV writers: “It was all a dream” is not a good TV trope.830 House of CardsBefore Kevin Spacey was kicked off the cast following more than 40 allegations of sexual assault, House of Cards was feeling stuck in the mud. The Underwoods’ journey to power had been fascinating their struggle to keep power, not so much. When Spacey was rightly dropped, the writers were forced to press on, with little time to rewrite the script as two episodes had already been filmed and needed completely redoing. Despite their best intentions, the final season was a mess – although the show’s legacy had already been tarnished by Spacey.Gogglebox’s premise is preposterously simple – film normal people watching television and capture their conversations. For such a basic recipe to work, all the ingredients need to be perfect, and, for a time, they were. Stephanie and Dominic Parker were the highlights for the first few seasons, and then the Moffatt family, with the quotable Scarlett, joined in the third series. However, fame soon caught up with both families, and they left the show one after the other. Their replacements have never been quite as good.The quality of Top Gear had long dwindled before Matt LeBlanc and Chris Evans took over from Jeremy Clarkson and co. It wasn’t until the trio finally left, though, that fans realised just how awful Top Gear could potentially be. LeBlanc and Evans had no chemistry, the pair awkwardly jostling with each other for screen-time. By the time their first series together had ended, Evans had received so much flack he decided to leave. Top Gear has not yet recovered – although everyone’s fingers are crossed in the hope that Chris Harris, Sabine Schmitz, Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff can return the show to its former glory.Sherlock made Benedict Cumberbatch a household name and had three stellar seasons before turning downhill. What great television those seasons were, with the modern take on the classic detective story proving a thrilling watch. Come the Christmas special and the writers had become too enthralled by their own mythos what was sold as a special episode, set in Victorian England, was actually modern-day Sherlock using drugs to e into his own subconscious. The episode was a mess – as was the following fourth season.Initially an addictive period drama, Downton Abbey slowly became more and more soapy. The point of no return came during the Christmas day episode “A Journey to the Highlands”, when – just moments after the birth of his child – Matthew Crawley was run over by a milk truck. Some fans were reportedly so outraged that they Tweeted how their Christmases were ruined.That 70s Show arguably had multiple “jump the shark” moments throughout its run. One such moment was when the writers introduced Brooke, who fell pregnant after a one-night stand with Ashton Kutcher’s Michael Kelso. The setup was merely a ploy to enable Kutcher to leave the show at the end of the season. Then there was the surprising revelation that Danny Masterson’s Steven Hyde had two fathers. But perhaps the moment that best signals the show’s downward spiral is when they decided to switch the actor who played Laurie Forman. After Lisa Robin Kelly had played Forman for five seasons, the showrunners unexpectedly – and without explanation – brought in Christina Moore to take over the character.1430 Buffy the Vampire SlayerBuffy has legions of fans, and for good reason. The first few seasons mesh funny quips and lovelorn lust to perfection, while it’s all strung together by a high-school story about a vampire-killing badass. Things started to waver slightly at the beginning of season six, when the series resolved their “is Buffy dead?” cliffhanger with the Scoobie gang resurrecting her. From there, the characters became shadows of their former selves, the story going to much darker places than before, including one controversial storyline about attempted rape. The show was never the same againStruggling to keep viewers watching, the writers of The Brady Bunch decided something needed to change. Rather than work with already-established characters, they decided to introduce a new child: Cousin Oliver, played by Robbie Rist, who was the show’s youngest actor (nine-years-old) at the time. This decision may have been intended to make The Brady Bunch “adorable” again, but viewers turned away at the obvious attempt to shoehorn something new into the show. The show was cancelled five episodes later and it sparked the phrase “Cousin Oliver Syndrome” – a trope where a show introduces a child character to boost ratings but fails. (Some fans believe the late introduction of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s sister Dawn is an example of this.)1630 Two and a Half MenTwo and a Half Men was, for a long time, one of the most-watched TV series in the United States. Why exactly? Well, that would likely be down to Charlie Sheen, whose obnoxious, heightened version of himself (his character’s also named Charlie) charmed the nation. Sheen’s private life, though, soon outdid his fictional counterpart, with the actor going into rehab and making headlines with his bizarre rants (winning!). The network took notice and replaced Sheen with Ashton Kutcher, whose naïve-shtick never quite worked.The first seasons of Battlestar Galactica (the updated series) were phenomenal television, but that did not stop the science fiction show having some slightly questionable moments. Perhaps the most famous came towards the season three finale, when the five remaining Cylons (human replicas) are outed. They are discovered (or discover themselves) when the Final Five – Tory, Colonel Tigh, Tyrol, and Anders – all come together after hearing a version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower”. It’s cumbersome, silly, and the tipping point for the once great show.The famous British poet John Cooper Clarke has argued many times that The Simpsons was one of best shows on television. “There is no better spokesperson for the modern proletarian male than Homer J Simpson,” he once said. Clarke was likely referring to only the first dozen or so seasons of The Simpsons as, since then, the animated show about the eponymous blue-collar family has suffered in its attempts to remain quite as relevant and funny. Season 30, as a result, contains the least-watched episode of The Simpsons ever: less than two million tuned in to the episode “I\u0027m Dancing as Fat as I Can”, guest starring Netflix boss Ted Sarandos.Despite stellar reviews and an adoring (if somewhat small) fanbase, Arrested Development was cancelled after its third season. Arrested Development should probably have stayed cancelled. Netflix brought back the acclaimed series for a fourth season in 2013, changing the format so each episode centred on a different character. Critics called the new approach awkward, saying it missed the character interactions that made the show so great. The showrunners seemingly agreed as they later released a remixed version of season four that followed the classic formula. That release came just before season five which has, to put it lightly, been decimated by critics. As Michael Bluth would say: “I don’t know what I expected.”Anthology series are hard to get right. On the one hand, each season can be completely different, allowing for creativity to flourish. On the other, writers need to somehow make sure that each season still feels like the same show, otherwise they risk alienating fans.Unlike the UK Office, the American counterpart went on too long. Steve Carell as Michael Scott was the heart of the show, and his departure in season seven was a massive hit for the series. Even comedy heavyweight Will Ferrell couldn’t fill the void left by Carell. And while the show was certainly never awful, the final episodes could not compete with the glorious highs of previous seasons.After eight seasons, Smallville was already losing fans, many of whom were desperately waiting for Superman to finally wear the suit (they would have to wait for the final episode). Romances were already growing too prolonged and then the superhero’s arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, decided to leave. With his contract complete, actor Michael Rosenbaum decided to jump ship, and the show never found a villain that could match him.Where does Prison Break go when the inmates break out of prison? That was a question many were left asking following the season one finale, which saw the main gang escape Fox River State Penitentiary. There was still some gas left in the engine for season two as they went on the run, but the decision to send them back to prison for season three saw the story retreading already well-worn ground.The X-Files masterfully kept viewers enthralled by its science fiction mysteries for eight seasons. Mulder and Scully were key to that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson’s chemistry electrified the show while keeping everything grounded. Unfortunately, due to contract arrangements, Mulder was written out during the season eight finale. That left the show in the hands of two other agents, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), who were short-changed with an incoherent storyline. As a result, the show was cancelled in 2002 – only to be brought back, with Duchovny and Anderson on board, in 2016.Although one of the most influential comedies of all time, Seinfeld was not without its faults. Season nine, the final one, marks a blemish on the iconic show’s history. Larry David, the highlight of season six through eight, was relegated to guest and only wrote the season finale. The other writers, meanwhile, were struggling to come up with new ideas – something that ironically proved the downfall for the show famously about nothing.Glee was a phenomenon. For a few years, Gleeks – fans of the show – were everywhere. That is until season three. The whimsy soon wore off as fans believed the show had become too overtly cheesy. Still, the Gleeks kept on singing, and the show continued for another three seasons.The late Noughties were a wonderful time for anti-heroes on television. Following in the footsteps of Tony Soprano were Mad Men’s Don Draper, Breaking Bad’s Walter White, and Dexter’s Dexter Morgan. While Don and Walter have become unquestioned pop-culture icons thanks to their series being of such phenomenal quality, Dexter’s legacy has become mired by two dire seasons and an unsatisfying conclusion. Season six was the first time the fictional serial killer dropped the baton. And while Dexter recovered for season seven, the following final few episodes were so unanimously panned that even the leading actor, Michael C Hall, reportedly thought they were awful.While Greg Wallace and Antony Worrall Thompson may have been the first two hosts of Saturday Kitchen, it was James Martin who really made the show a success. Under his steady guidance, viewership increased from 1.2 million to around 2.5 million and the cookery programme became a staple weekend watch. No replacement host has been brought on board since Martin left in 2016, and the show has suffered as a result. At least the Keith Floyd and Rick Stein repeats are as good as ever. What started as a critically adored Buff the Vampire Slayer spin-off soon became a run-of-the-mill drama. Angel started with its focus on the eponymous vampire-with-a-heart working as a private detective and saving humans from other demons. However, after Angel came to terms with his ongoing struggle between his human side and his vampire side, the show became a little stale. Season three was filled with filler episodes and shallow villains. Then came season four a narrative mess that struggled to reconcile the characters Cordelia and Connor. Even with the stellar episode Spin the Bottle in the mix, many fans were unimpressed by the direction the show had gone in.David Lynch’s dreamy murder mystery has become a cult classic, and for good reason. The first season was wonderfully strange and melodramatic. Then the network began putting pressure on Lynch to reveal to the world who killed Laura Palmer. Lynch had not wanted to reveal the murderer but was forced to. The show lacked the same drive after the discovery. Considering the showrunner himself has said the second season “sucked” it’s no stretch to say that it jumped the shark.130 Parks and RecreationParks and Recreation’s sixth season was filmed while Chris Pratt was on the cusp of becoming a global megastar. To keep him involved, the crew had to head to where the actor was filming his other, bigger projects (hence the season begins with a double episode in London, where he was filming s of the Galaxy).

Obviously, things did not go well for the actor, and the writing team put him back into the show – at the expense of viewers, who felt understandably short-changed by the events of 31 episodes being reversed. Note for TV writers: “It was all a dream” is not a good TV trope.830 House of CardsBefore Kevin Spacey was kicked off the cast following more than 40 allegations of sexual assault, House of Cards was feeling stuck in the mud. The Underwoods’ journey to power had been fascinating their struggle to keep power, not so much. When Spacey was rightly dropped, the writers were forced to press on, with little time to rewrite the script as two episodes had already been filmed and needed completely redoing. Despite their best intentions, the final season was a mess – although the show’s legacy had already been tarnished by Spacey.Gogglebox’s premise is preposterously simple – film normal people watching television and capture their conversations. For such a basic recipe to work, all the ingredients need to be perfect, and, for a time, they were. Stephanie and Dominic Parker were the highlights for the first few seasons, and then the Moffatt family, with the quotable Scarlett, joined in the third series. However, fame soon caught up with both families, and they left the show one after the other. Their replacements have never been quite as good.The quality of Top Gear had long dwindled before Matt LeBlanc and Chris Evans took over from Jeremy Clarkson and co. It wasn’t until the trio finally left, though, that fans realised just how awful Top Gear could potentially be. LeBlanc and Evans had no chemistry, the pair awkwardly jostling with each other for screen-time. By the time their first series together had ended, Evans had received so much flack he decided to leave. Top Gear has not yet recovered – although everyone’s fingers are crossed in the hope that Chris Harris, Sabine Schmitz, Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff can return the show to its former glory.Sherlock made Benedict Cumberbatch a household name and had three stellar seasons before turning downhill. What great television those seasons were, with the modern take on the classic detective story proving a thrilling watch. Come the Christmas special and the writers had become too enthralled by their own mythos what was sold as a special episode, set in Victorian England, was actually modern-day Sherlock using drugs to e into his own subconscious. The episode was a mess – as was the following fourth season.Initially an addictive period drama, Downton Abbey slowly became more and more soapy. The point of no return came during the Christmas day episode “A Journey to the Highlands”, when – just moments after the birth of his child – Matthew Crawley was run over by a milk truck. Some fans were reportedly so outraged that they Tweeted how their Christmases were ruined.That 70s Show arguably had multiple “jump the shark” moments throughout its run. One such moment was when the writers introduced Brooke, who fell pregnant after a one-night stand with Ashton Kutcher’s Michael Kelso. The setup was merely a ploy to enable Kutcher to leave the show at the end of the season. Then there was the surprising revelation that Danny Masterson’s Steven Hyde had two fathers. But perhaps the moment that best signals the show’s downward spiral is when they decided to switch the actor who played Laurie Forman. After Lisa Robin Kelly had played Forman for five seasons, the showrunners unexpectedly – and without explanation – brought in Christina Moore to take over the character.1430 Buffy the Vampire SlayerBuffy has legions of fans, and for good reason. The first few seasons mesh funny quips and lovelorn lust to perfection, while it’s all strung together by a high-school story about a vampire-killing badass. Things started to waver slightly at the beginning of season six, when the series resolved their “is Buffy dead?” cliffhanger with the Scoobie gang resurrecting her. From there, the characters became shadows of their former selves, the story going to much darker places than before, including one controversial storyline about attempted rape. The show was never the same againStruggling to keep viewers watching, the writers of The Brady Bunch decided something needed to change. Rather than work with already-established characters, they decided to introduce a new child: Cousin Oliver, played by Robbie Rist, who was the show’s youngest actor (nine-years-old) at the time. This decision may have been intended to make The Brady Bunch “adorable” again, but viewers turned away at the obvious attempt to shoehorn something new into the show. The show was cancelled five episodes later and it sparked the phrase “Cousin Oliver Syndrome” – a trope where a show introduces a child character to boost ratings but fails. (Some fans believe the late introduction of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s sister Dawn is an example of this.)1630 Two and a Half MenTwo and a Half Men was, for a long time, one of the most-watched TV series in the United States. Why exactly? Well, that would likely be down to Charlie Sheen, whose obnoxious, heightened version of himself (his character’s also named Charlie) charmed the nation. Sheen’s private life, though, soon outdid his fictional counterpart, with the actor going into rehab and making headlines with his bizarre rants (winning!). The network took notice and replaced Sheen with Ashton Kutcher, whose naïve-shtick never quite worked.The first seasons of Battlestar Galactica (the updated series) were phenomenal television, but that did not stop the science fiction show having some slightly questionable moments. Perhaps the most famous came towards the season three finale, when the five remaining Cylons (human replicas) are outed. They are discovered (or discover themselves) when the Final Five – Tory, Colonel Tigh, Tyrol, and Anders – all come together after hearing a version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower”. It’s cumbersome, silly, and the tipping point for the once great show.The famous British poet John Cooper Clarke has argued many times that The Simpsons was one of best shows on television. “There is no better spokesperson for the modern proletarian male than Homer J Simpson,” he once said. Clarke was likely referring to only the first dozen or so seasons of The Simpsons as, since then, the animated show about the eponymous blue-collar family has suffered in its attempts to remain quite as relevant and funny. Season 30, as a result, contains the least-watched episode of The Simpsons ever: less than two million tuned in to the episode “I\u0027m Dancing as Fat as I Can”, guest starring Netflix boss Ted Sarandos.Despite stellar reviews and an adoring (if somewhat small) fanbase, Arrested Development was cancelled after its third season. Arrested Development should probably have stayed cancelled. Netflix brought back the acclaimed series for a fourth season in 2013, changing the format so each episode centred on a different character. Critics called the new approach awkward, saying it missed the character interactions that made the show so great. The showrunners seemingly agreed as they later released a remixed version of season four that followed the classic formula. That release came just before season five which has, to put it lightly, been decimated by critics. As Michael Bluth would say: “I don’t know what I expected.”Anthology series are hard to get right. On the one hand, each season can be completely different, allowing for creativity to flourish. On the other, writers need to somehow make sure that each season still feels like the same show, otherwise they risk alienating fans.Unlike the UK Office, the American counterpart went on too long. Steve Carell as Michael Scott was the heart of the show, and his departure in season seven was a massive hit for the series. Even comedy heavyweight Will Ferrell couldn’t fill the void left by Carell. And while the show was certainly never awful, the final episodes could not compete with the glorious highs of previous seasons.After eight seasons, Smallville was already losing fans, many of whom were desperately waiting for Superman to finally wear the suit (they would have to wait for the final episode). Romances were already growing too prolonged and then the superhero’s arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, decided to leave. With his contract complete, actor Michael Rosenbaum decided to jump ship, and the show never found a villain that could match him.Where does Prison Break go when the inmates break out of prison? That was a question many were left asking following the season one finale, which saw the main gang escape Fox River State Penitentiary. There was still some gas left in the engine for season two as they went on the run, but the decision to send them back to prison for season three saw the story retreading already well-worn ground.The X-Files masterfully kept viewers enthralled by its science fiction mysteries for eight seasons. Mulder and Scully were key to that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson’s chemistry electrified the show while keeping everything grounded. Unfortunately, due to contract arrangements, Mulder was written out during the season eight finale. That left the show in the hands of two other agents, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), who were short-changed with an incoherent storyline. As a result, the show was cancelled in 2002 – only to be brought back, with Duchovny and Anderson on board, in 2016.Although one of the most influential comedies of all time, Seinfeld was not without its faults. Season nine, the final one, marks a blemish on the iconic show’s history. Larry David, the highlight of season six through eight, was relegated to guest and only wrote the season finale. The other writers, meanwhile, were struggling to come up with new ideas – something that ironically proved the downfall for the show famously about nothing.Glee was a phenomenon. For a few years, Gleeks – fans of the show – were everywhere. That is until season three. The whimsy soon wore off as fans believed the show had become too overtly cheesy. Still, the Gleeks kept on singing, and the show continued for another three seasons.The late Noughties were a wonderful time for anti-heroes on television. Following in the footsteps of Tony Soprano were Mad Men’s Don Draper, Breaking Bad’s Walter White, and Dexter’s Dexter Morgan. While Don and Walter have become unquestioned pop-culture icons thanks to their series being of such phenomenal quality, Dexter’s legacy has become mired by two dire seasons and an unsatisfying conclusion. Season six was the first time the fictional serial killer dropped the baton. And while Dexter recovered for season seven, the following final few episodes were so unanimously panned that even the leading actor, Michael C Hall, reportedly thought they were awful.While Greg Wallace and Antony Worrall Thompson may have been the first two hosts of Saturday Kitchen, it was James Martin who really made the show a success. Under his steady guidance, viewership increased from 1.2 million to around 2.5 million and the cookery programme became a staple weekend watch. No replacement host has been brought on board since Martin left in 2016, and the show has suffered as a result. At least the Keith Floyd and Rick Stein repeats are as good as ever. What started as a critically adored Buff the Vampire Slayer spin-off soon became a run-of-the-mill drama. Angel started with its focus on the eponymous vampire-with-a-heart working as a private detective and saving humans from other demons. However, after Angel came to terms with his ongoing struggle between his human side and his vampire side, the show became a little stale. Season three was filled with filler episodes and shallow villains. Then came season four a narrative mess that struggled to reconcile the characters Cordelia and Connor. Even with the stellar episode Spin the Bottle in the mix, many fans were unimpressed by the direction the show had gone in.David Lynch’s dreamy murder mystery has become a cult classic, and for good reason. The first season was wonderfully strange and melodramatic. Then the network began putting pressure on Lynch to reveal to the world who killed Laura Palmer. Lynch had not wanted to reveal the murderer but was forced to. The show lacked the same drive after the discovery. Considering the showrunner himself has said the second season “sucked” it’s no stretch to say that it jumped the shark.“I’ve never seen an actor be so protective about their character,” Jagannathan said. “If you’re on set and the director and the producer and the writer say something, you will step out of character, take the notes, and then go back in. That’s just what I’ve seen.“And Meryl was – it wasn’t that she wouldn’t entertain any comments, she just wouldn’t entertain any comments that insinuated that she was the villain of the piece. Or any comments that asked her to up the ante on the villain-ness. She was just very protective of her character. She would literally say, ‘That’s none of your business, I don’t think.’ I literally did a double take.”Critics are shredding the ‘lacklustre’ Big Little Lies finaleHBO responds to reports of behind-the-scenes Big Little Lies dramaMeryl Streep chose to wear fake teeth for role in Big Little LiesJagannathan did, however, insist that Streep wasn’t malicious in her interaction with the show’s behind-the-scenes crew. “She’s not saying that out of being rude or anything,” she explained. “She just has to protect the integrity and the humanity of her character.”The second season of Big Little Lies, which earned mixed reviews for its finale last Sunday, had been blighted with controversy in recent weeks, after IndieWire revealed that Arnold, the British director behind films including Fish Tank and American Honey, had been locked out of the editing room and had her work cut to ribbons without her knowledge by director Jean-Marc Vallée, who directed the show’s first season.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.National Museums Liverpool Collection © Peter Doig, DACS 2019. Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery, New York and London430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.130 Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, ParisIt\u0027s the mysteriously serene smile of this painting\u0027s subject – thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant – that has given it universal fame. The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.National Museums Liverpool Collection © Peter Doig, DACS 2019. Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery, New York and London430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches.

He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”.

It reported that the Royal Navy warship HMS Montrose closely shadowed the vessel, but did not provide a direct escort.Data from the tracking site Marine Traffic showed the commercial ship arrived at a port in Qatar early on Wednesday after transiting the strait.The ship’s owner BW LPG declined to comment on specifics, but said the company “is grateful for the UK and international community for their naval presence” providing security to ships in the area.The standoff will be one of the first diplomatic challenges confronting incoming prime minister Boris Johnson.Additional reporting by agenciesStrait of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So let’s not pretend I don’t need the show every bit as much as the Love Islanders deserve the low-grade abuse contained in this quiz, whichtests just how closely you’ve been watching.

I wish him and the Government he will lead every good fortune in the months and years ahead.Their successes will be our country’s successes, and I hope that they will be many.She repeated her call for the new PM to negotiate a Brexit deal in a possible warning to Mr Johnson that shed join the bid to block No Dealnecessary.Mrs May said: Much remains to be done – the immediate priority being to complete our exit from the European Union in a way that works for the whole United Kingdom.She concluded with a tribute to Philip, describing him as my greatest supporter and my closest companion.At that point a protester could be heard shouting Stop Brexit - prompting Mr May to quip That wasnt me while the outgoing PM said: I think not.She concluded: This is a country of aspiration and opportunity and I hope that every young girl who has seen a woman Prime Minister now knows for sure that there are no limits to what they can achieve.The couple then travelled to the Palace for their last audience with Her Majesty.They were greeted by Edward Young, the Queens private secretary, and Major Nana Kofi Twumasi-Ankrah, Her Majestys equerry, who shook hands with the Mays.They entered via the Kings Door of the Palace, where lady-in-waiting Lady Susan Hussey led them inside.A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said afterwards: The Right Honourable Theresa May MP had an Audience of The Queen this afternoon and tendered her resignation as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, which Her Majesty was graciously pleased to accept.Opening PMQs for the final time earlier today, Mrs May told the Commons: This afternoon I shall have an audience with Her Majesty the Queen.I will then continue with my duties in this house from the back benches, where I will continue to be the member of Parliament for Maidenhead.Askedshe was upset to be handing over to Boris, Mrs May hit back: I am pleased to hand over to an incoming leader of the Conservative party and Prime Minister who I worked with when he was in my Cabinet and who is committed to delivering on the vote of the British people in  and to delivering for the people of this country.She added: I look forward in the back benches to giving my full support to the next Prime Minister as he takes us forward to delivering on Brexit and continuing to deliver on those Conservative priorities.And she called on her success to make education funding his top priority after entering No.Jeremy Corbyn praised Mrs Mays sense of public duty and called on her to join him as a backbench rebel, blocking BoJos reckless Brexit plans alongside her Chancellor Philip Hammond.But he also launched a string of vicious attacks on her record, claiming she had driven an increase in poverty and crime and blasted: Does the Prime Minister have any regrets He also called on the incoming PM to call a snap election as soon as possible to let the people decide their future.Mrs May responded by paying tribute to her rival for his work in his local area - but also called on him to resign after losing the backing of his own MPs.She quipped: Can I finish by saying this - as a party leader who has accepted when her time is up, perhaps the time is now for him to do the same.It was an echo of David Camerons final PMQs, where he blasted: It might be in my party’s interest for him to sit there. It’s not in the national interest. I would say – for heaven’s sake, man, go!The attack was supported by ex-Labour MP Ian Austin, who said in the Commons: Its very clear to me that the vast majority of Labour MPs agree with her too.Mrs May also hit out at Mr Corbyn for blocking Brexit, saying: At every stage, his only object has been playing party politics and frankly he should be ashamed of himself.Her last Commons performance as PM was watched by husband Philip, who got a name check from Mrs May as she said she was very pleased hed come along to support him.Fierce critic Jacob Rees-Mogg attempted to build bridges with the outgoing leader, saying: As somebody who has not iniably seen eye-to-eye with the Prime Minister, may I thank her for her remarkable public service.And for showing that highest of virtues - a sense of duty - and on top of that being willing to deal with people who must on occasion be annoying to her with enormous courtesy.Mrs May finished the hour-long session - believed to be the longest PMQs ever - by saying: We are living through extraordinary political times, and this house is rightly at the centre of those events.Thats because of the vital link between every single member of this house and the communities we represent. Thats the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy and of our liberty.She concluded: That duty to serve my constituents will remain my greatest motivation.After Mrs May left the Commons the flood of resignations from her Government began.Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke, deputy PM David Lidington and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart all confirmed they wouldnt serve under Boris.Mr Hammond wrote to Mrs May saying: I believe that your successor must be free to choose a Chancellor who is fully aligned with his policy position.It has been a privilege to serve as your Chancellor for just over three years.Mr Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, added: After more than two decades of collective responsibility Im now relishing the prospect of speaking and campaigning freely for the things that matter to me and to my constituents.Mrs May has gone back to No for a final lunch with her staff.She will later visit Buckingham Palace to hand her resignation to the Queen, and will also make a short speech in Downing Street.Mr Johnson will formally take over as Prime Minister shortly afterwards.He is expected to make his own speech outside No, then will enter talks with security officials to ensure he is up to speed on the threats facing the UK.This evening the new PM is expected to announce the appointment of certain key Cabinet ministers.The full team will be unveiled tomorrow with the line-up of the top table providing a clue to how Boris will govern the country.Mrs May will speed away from London immediately and go to her Berkshire home with husband Philip.She has vowed to continue as backbench MP for Maidenhead under her successor Mr Johnson.Heres how Theresa Mays last day in office - and Boris Johnsons first - is playing out :pm May takes Prime Ministers Questions in the Commons for the final timepm She gives short farewell speech outside  Downing Street.pm May travels to Buckingham Palace and hands resignation to the Queen.pm Johnson goes to the Palace and kisses hands with Her Majesty, becoming the new Prime Ministerpm Boris arrives at No and gives his own speech before going inside for security briefingspm Johnson summons ministers who wont get a new job to his office and tells them theyre sackedpm The new PM starts appointing his Cabinet with at least six top jobs to be filled todayTomorrow the House of Commons starts its summer recess and will not sit again for five weeks.That means the new PM wont have to face a grilling from MPs until Wednesday, September .But Boris is weighing up whether to make a Commons statement tomorrow morning in a bid to stave off a rebellion from furious backbenchers."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures allied troops road berlin d day book","story":"Harrowing pictures from the latter stages of World War Two include US soldiers running into battle as a shell bursts, a field full of abandoned German helmets, and a crash landing for an allied paratrooper.Another incredible image portrays the fearful yet stoic expression of a -year-old tank operator, captured just days before he was killed in action, and the gutted landscape of a Dutch town ravaged by constant air raids.Historian Brooke S. Blades’ new book The Americans from Normandy to the German Border: Rare Photographs from Wartime Archives offers an enthralling, chilling, and gruesome insight into what the American soldiers faced following the D-day landings in the summer ,  years ago.After tens of thousands of courageous allied soldiers tackled the terrying prospect of landing on France’s heavily fortied northern shore and managed to break through the Nazi’s defences, the Allied Forces were then tasked with beating the Third Reich troops back to Germany.Blades explains: “This book takes up the story of the massive American contribution to the campaign in north West Europe during the autumn and early winter of .“Following the dramatic breakout from the Normandy bridgehead, events moved fast with the liberation of Paris quickly following and the Allies closed in on the German border.“But the apparent collapse of the Nazis was illusory.As lines of communication ened and German resistance stfened, the Allied High Command was ided on the right strategy.The ill-fated Operation Market Garden brought home the reality that the war would continue into .The Siegried Line was penetrated and Aachen fell but the American First Army suffered heavy casualties in the Hurtgen Forest.As winter set in, the third Army crossed the Moselle River and into the Saar.“The stage was set for the costliest battle in American history – The Battle of The Bulge.”Following D-Day, the Allied Forces were locked in fierce, close encounter fighting in northern France in a six-week skirmish known at the ‘battle of the hedgerows’ due to the intimate fighting theatre.In particular larger communities such as Caen put up dramatic resistance and it took a huge amount of manpower and effort to sht the entrenched German defenders.More blood would be shed and a huge number of German prisoners of war interned following the formation of the ‘Falaise Pocket’ - a huge swath of Third Reich troops and their vehicles who ended up trapped due to a rapid pincer movement from the Allied Forces.Blades’ book also looks at other key events, including the liberation of Paris, Operation Dragoon, and the costly ‘Operation Market Garden’.Including approximately , involved on D-Day itself , during the Battle of Normandy over , Allied and German troops were killed, wounded or went missing overall.This figure includes around , Allied casualties, with nearly , killed amongst the ground forces and a further , deaths amongst the Allied air forces.German losses of around , were killed or wounded a further , were taken prisoner during the Campaign.Looking just at the fierce fighting which took place around the Falaise Pocketin August , the German Army suffered losses in excess of , men, including those taken prisoner."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may leaving speech","story":"Mrs May made her farewell speech with loyal husband Philip by her side, who she praised as her greatest supporter and closest companion.Theresa May gave an emotional speech outside of Number  at . pm on July , her husband Philip by her side.You can watch the former Prime Ministers farewell speech here.She told reporters: To serve as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the greatest honour.The heavy responsibilities are outweighed by the huge potential to serve your country.But you achieve nothing alone.And as I leave Downing Street, my final words are of sincere thanks.Earlier on she took questions in parliament for the last time, known as PMQS.In her final message to Jeremy Corbyn during her PMQs, Theresa May said: One thing we both have in common is a commitment to our constituencies, I saw that after the terrorist in Finsbury Park Mosque in his constituency.Perhaps I could just finish my exchange with him by saying this: As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up, perhaps the time is now for him to do the same Mays PMQs lasted  minutes, compared to David Camerons in  lasting just  minutes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

soar to an unprecedented C, smashing the current record of .C set in Kent in August .The hot weather is blasting in from an African plume of Saharan air.Some forecast models show the high humidity levels could make the temperature feel like C on Thursday.Last night, the UKs hottest ever night-time temperature of .C in Brighton may have been broken.And today the Met Office said the temperature hit .C at Cavendish in Suffolk and reached .C in Writtle, Essex.At Heathrow in London, the mercury rose to .C, while at St Jamess Park it reached .C.The sweltering conditions prompted Network Rail to impose train speed restrictions in areas where tracks were at risk of buckling.Southeastern railway even urged commuters to avoid travelling, as services were expected to experience huge delays.Extreme weather action teamswere activated to keep passengers safe and trains running.Now emergency services warned the public to take precautions during the extreme heat.Temperatures reached .C on the Central Line this evening.Commuters were snapped appearing rather worse for wear, on packed tubes.Officials have also highlighted the risks of cooling off in the sea, lakes and rivers.The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the industry, advised passengers in London and the South East to consider changing their travel plans on Thursday because of the expected heat.Met Office Meteorologist Matthew Box said it is more likely both the .C July record and the all-time maximum of .C will fall before the end of the week.He said: “We now think there is an -per cent chance that the July record will be broken on Thursday with a -per cent chance the all-time record will fall.“Models indicate a lot of warm air coming up from the Continent especially across eastern parts of the country.“High pressure is over the Continent and this allowing energy from the sun to heat the region, this air is then going to come up and into the UK.“There is a chance that it will turn slightly fresher as we go into the weekend, however eastern Britain could remain very warm.”As temperatures soar across the country, emergency services warned the public to take precautions during the extreme heat and highlighted the risks of cooling off in the sea, lakes and rivers.And gritters could be brought out during the heatwave as temperatures could cause roads to melt.RAC Breakdown spokesman Rod Dennis said: “The sweltering heat is going to inevitably lead to some softer road surfaces over the next few days.“If you see some blacker patches of road or pavement, that’s how you can tell it’s starting to melt.“It also means that drivers might start to see something that they’d normally only associate with the depths of winter – gritting trucks.“Salt can help improve the grip on roads that are starting melt.”The hottest day ever comes a year to the day after The Sun told how the planet was gripped by a mammoth killer heatwave, with temps hitting C in Britain.Experts at the Energy  Climate Intelligence Unit last night warned of the potential impact of todays forecast record temperature.Deputy director Peter Chalkley said: “Exactly a year to the day since The Sun’s iconic ‘world’s on fire’ frontpage, Britain could see its all-time temperature record broken.“In the past year the Met Office has told us that ’s heatwave was made around  times more likely by climate change.“Scientists have predicted and tracked the increased frequency and severity of heatwaves and the British public are increasingly concerned about climate change.“Experts are highlighting that older people and also the very young as well as farmers and even power stations can struggle in the increased heat we are seeing.”It comes after lightning storms triggered fires and rail disruption on Tuesday night.Incredible pictures captured the skies illuminated with arcs of lightning as powerful electrical storms.The Met Office last night issued a yellow warning for scattered thunderstorms covering the east of the country from Scotland down to London from pm on Thursday and into early Friday morning.It also warned flooding and lightning strikes could affect driving conditions, disrupt train services and lead to power cuts.Record-breaking temperatures are also expected across Europe.The most extreme heat will now build from central and northern France into Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and far western Germany into Thursday.Temperatures of .C are forecast for Paris tomorrow, breaking the current record of .C at Parc Montsouris, set more than  years

nuclear deterrent: Because you have it, you don’t have to use it.But as one of those involved in devising this approach tells me, for it to work, “both elements of the strategy have to be credible”. In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, they can enrol in a course on gender studies and emerge in three years with a degree which will not help them one bit to get a decent job.And as a consequence they will be at least £, in debt. But they’ll have a piece of paper which will tell possible employers: “Look — I’ve been a total mug for three years. Gizza job!”The unemployment rate for students at Britain’s worst universities, such as East London and London South Bank, is around about double the national rate for young people.In other words, going to university worsened their chances of getting a job.That’s not what they were led to believe, is it. They were told a university degree would open doors for them. Not slam the doors shut in their spotty faces. And leave them with a whopping loan to pay off.Our young people have been conned for far too long.We have a new Prime Minister now. And I think it would be a good ideahe took a very close look at higher education. OK, he’s got Brexit to sort out first, fine. But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must. They are no longer allowed to employ common sense.In order to be politically correct they have had to shed all semblance of judgment.THE job of a bookshop, you would have thought, is to sell books.Trouble is, they are useless at it. They are politically biased and cater solely to a tiny minority of gibbering liberals.I’ve got a book out at the moment, called The Great Betrayal – The True Story Of Brexit. I’ve had complaints from people who want to read it that they can’t find it in bookshops.The bookshop staff say they thought there wouldn’t be any interest in it. But it was the No best-seller in the country and was No on Amazon worldwide. It’s pure political bias.If you want the book – go on Amazon.TOP prize in the “Most Rational and Measured Response to Boris Johnson Becoming Prime Minister” goes to – of course – .For this headline: “The Clown Is Crowned As The Country Burns In Hell.”Followed by , words of hysterical drivel.Brilliant. The Left really don’t like it when they don’t get their own way.Anyway, this is but the first example of BDS – Boris Derangement Syndrome. Don’t worry. Lots more of it to come.MAGIC grandpa has a cunning plan!The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced to the Press that he was going to “surprise Boris Johnson” by calling a vote of no confidence.Here’s a tip, you Jew-bothering, bearded c**kwomble.If you want something to be a surprise for someone, don’t tell every newspaper in the country.THE Islamist crackpots in Iran have hijacked two of our oil tankers.

The Mirror double-decker, backed by union the GMB, set off in London yesterday as we vowed to hold him to account for every untruth uttered, launching hashtags #BorisLieBuster and #WeAreWatchingYouBoris. And the reaction made us wonder how long it will be before his time in the UK’s driving seat is over. The open-topper had dozens of passengers and crowds cheered it around Parliament Square and Westminster.    Boris lookalike Drew Galdron sang songs including I’m the King of the Bungle – and Fleetwood Mac’s Little Lies boomed out over the speakers. But behind the fun, the message was deadly serious. GMB members waving placards bearing some of his porkies urged Boris to drop his hardline Brexit stance – and stop lying now he has won the highest office. Chief Tim Roache warned: “We’re watching you, Boris. No-deal Brexit will bring ­political Armageddon. Boris offers no hope to workers.” Harry Picken, , of Barnes, South West London, has just graduated from Lancaster University in history and politics. He said: “Boris represents everything wrong about society. “He is not someone [to] be trusted. He was part of a campaign that lied. He doesn’t intend to unite the country.”    Christine Golding, education convenor for the GMB and chair of the National School Committee, said: “When I found out Boris was going to be Prime Minister, I was angry. “His record doesn’t come across as someone listening to us. I want to know what he’s going to do for education. I work with people who have two jobs and still can’t afford to live. How is he going to help  We’ve been decimated in schools. Is he going to put money back in  Of course he’s not.” And teacher Sophie Ingram, , from Suffolk, said: “I’m scared for the future. I have to teach ‘British values’ of tolerance and respect and Boris is not the poster boy for that.  The children I teach are scared too. Tory austerity has meant some teachers feed pupils and even their parents.” Our passengers made it clear that as we buckle up for a bumpy ride with Boris, we must hold him to account. The Mirror will not let him use lies to steer us down the wrong road. Paul Routledgeaposs view The top deck of the Mirror Boris Lie Buster bus was the coolest place in London. We caught the breeze while our Boris lookalike was shooting it. Tourists gawped, motorists hooted their horns in support and sightseers even thought he was the real thing. Three years ago the Johnson bus lied to take us out of the EU. Yesterday the Mirror Liebuster bus told the truth. Our Boris exposed the porkies in songs like I’m The King Of The Bungle and It had To Be Eu-Who-Who… On College Green by Westminster we even got a wave from hardline Tory Brexiteer Nigel Evans MP.

As his career burnt in the ashes of a party ­management tactic – the EU ­referendum – he was destined to go down as the worst Prime ­Minister of modern times. Three years later, he is only the third worst. He lost the referendum. Theresa May failed to deliver on the result. Despite her “legacy tour” and though there is some “poisoned chalice” sympathy, she ­nonetheless left office having failed in virtually everything she set out to do. The burning injustices still burn. Brexit has not been ­delivered.  Now Boris Johnson takes over. I see no way that can end well for him or, more importantly, for Britain. I predict he will be even worse than his predecessors.    Those of us on the losing side of political arguments right now must be humble enough to admit we could be wrong, and that he may prove us all wrong. But I have known Johnson for a long time. First, as fellow ­journalists. Then, with him covering the government I worked for. Then, with both of us on the political front line. Now, with me as a commentator cum anti-Brexit campaigner and him as Prime Minister. It is hard to compute.  Because I can think of no other senior position being filled by someone so unqualied to do the job, especially at this crucial time for the country. Older readers may remember when a businessman called Michael Knighton took over Manchester United. When I think of Johnson, I think of Knighton ball-juggling at Old Trafford. I am currently – thank God, given what is happening back home – in Australia.    And the general impression I get from Aussies is that they think, what with Brexit and now Johnson, the Mother Country has gone bonkers.   In his head, Johnson is Winston Churchill. In truth, he is a pound-shop Trump. He lies with the same ease as the US President. Like Trump, he seeks credit for anything good. Think London Olympics, in which he played a minor role but used it to promote himself, as he does with everything he touches. Like Trump, he shts blame when it should be his. Think the failed vanity projects, like his island airport or his garden bridge. And also, think of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe languishing in Iranian jails and psychiatric units while the man, who made it so much worse for her, enters Downing Street to take charge of UK foreign policy.  He is lazy. That doesn’t mean he can’t put in the hours. But they are devoted to the game of politics and media, not the hard graft of policy and delivery. He is dismissive of detail. He is loose with his language as well as his morals. He is a bad judge of character. He is untrustworthy. He has no moral compass or fixed beliefs – hence writing two articles, one for Remain, one for Leave, before deciding that his own interests in the referendum were best served by backing Leave. Everything he has e ver done in his le has been largely about himself, his profile, his career. And that same narcissism is reflected in his personal le where, as his famous shouting match with his current girlfriend Carrie Symonds appeared to show, it all has to be on his terms and to hell with the consequences for others.  Fair play to him on one level – everything he set out to do he has done it. Got all the positions he sought at Eton and Oxford. Made a name for himself as a journalist not least in Brussels by making up stories and, to the Daily ’s shame, getting away with it. Edited a magazine. Won a seat in Parliament. Won two terms as Mayor of London, historically a Labour city. Made history in leading the winning side in the referendum. Became Foreign Secretary. And now, the job he always saw as his destiny, sitting in Churchill’s chair.  But now he is there, his mettle will be tested as never before. He will have a large number of right-wing press sycophants who will help cover up his failings and exaggerate his successes.

More than half of Theresa Mayaposs cabinet -  out of  - were either sacked or resigned in the new PMaposs brutal reshuffle. Both Remainers and supporters of leadership rival Jeremy Hunt were shown the door as Johnson ruthlessly dumped enemies - including Mr Hunt himself who quit after refusing a demotion to Defence Secretary. Right-wing Tories Sajid Javid, Priti Patel and Dominic Raab were ushered in as Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary respectively. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and DWP chief Amber Rudd kept their jobs after swallowing their pride - and principles - to offer some support for Mr Johnson. And disgraced former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson ed as Education Secretary despite having to resign over a national security leak .    Itaposs thought to be the biggest clearout of Government ministers in political history - one that takes us back to the ideology of Margaret Thatcher and rewards hard Leavers as Mr Johnson tilts towards a No Deal Brexit. It shocked Westminster with its speed and viciousness, rewarding loyalists and ejecting ministers who were key to Mrs May’s regime, and those he feared might torpedo his plan to tear Britain out of the EU without a deal on October . Itaposs also so big that the sacked ministers are in line for more than £, in severance pay between them. So whoaposs backed for promotion, whoaposs sacked by the boss, and whoaposs cracked under the pressure in Boris Johnsonaposs new-look team  Weaposve had a look at them all - and their more chequered records. This piece is being updated throughout the Cabinet reshuffle. BACKED: The new Cabinet in full  Prime Minister: Boris Johnson Chancellor: Sajid Javid Home Secretary: Priti Patel Foreign Secretary: Dominic Raab Defence Secretary: Ben Wallace Cabinet Office Minister: Michael Gove Trade Secretary: Liz Truss Chief Secretary to the Treasury: Rishi Sunak Health Secretary: Matt Hancock Work and Pensions Secretary: Amber Rudd Environment Secretary: Theresa Villiers Brexit Secretary: Stephen Barclay Education Secretary: Gavin Williamson Culture Secretary: Nicky Morgan Business Secretary: Andrea Leadsom Communities Secretary: Robert Jenrick Justice Secretary: Robert Buckland Scottish Secretary: Alister Jack Transport Secretary: Grant Shapps Northern Ireland Secretary: Julian Smith Wales Secretary: Alun Cairns Conservative Party Chairman and Minister without Portfolio: James Cleverly Leader of the House of Commons: Jacob Rees-Mogg Leader of the House of Lords: Baroness Evans Universities Minister: Jo Johnson Housing Minister: Esther McVey Immigration Minister: Brandon Lewis Paymaster General: Oliver Dowden   SACKED  CRACKED: All  Tories sacked or resigned  Theresa MayDavid LidingtonPhilip HammondJeremy HuntPenny MordauntDavid GaukeGreg ClarkLiam FoxDamian HindsJames BrokenshireChris GraylingDavid MundellKaren BradleyRory StewartJeremy WrightMel StrideJulian SmithPORTRAITS OF THE INS AND OUTS BACKED: New hires to Cabinet Chief Whip: Mark Spencer VOTED REMAIN  The MP for Sherwood since  will be the PMaposs own Sherf of Nottingham, trying to win over Tory MPs in Brexit votes despite a working majority of just one or two. Itaposs an about-turn for Mr Spencer - who voted Remain in the  referendum. The state-educated politician studied at Shuttleworth Agricultural College in Bedfordshire and joined his familyaposs farming and farm shop business. He joined Parliament in  where he was a backbencher for six years. His big break was in the Tory whipsapos office, which he joined in June . He prompted fury in  by suggesting a dying benefit claimant, sanctioned after he turned up four minutes late, should learn the discipline of timekeeping. Labour MP Lisa Nandy said the man hadn’t eaten for  days and looked like he was dying but Mr Sherwood cut in: It is important that those who are seeking employment learn the discipline of timekeeping. Separately, Mr Spencer - who receives at least £, in rent per year from a farm - was one of  Tory landlords who voted against a Commons bid to force all homes to be fit for human habitation in .    Home Secretary: Priti Patel VOTED LEAVE  Shamed Tory ex minister Priti Patel will be handed a plum job in Boris Johnsonaposs top team - with some tipping her as a possible Home Secretary. Theresa May sacked Ms Patel as International Development Secretary in  after she had aposoff-the-booksapos meetings with senior Israeli officials during a aposfamily holidayapos. But Mr Johnson was expected to trumpet herto the Cabinet as part of a record number of ethnic minority politicians in the team. The -year-old MP for Witham, Essex, is a hard-right Tory who backs tax cuts and supported the death penalty until . Sheaposs also a Brexiteer aposultraapos who voted against Theresa Mayaposs deal all three times in Parliament. She was slammed in December for suggesting the government could use possible Brexit food shortages as leverage. A government report said No Deal could prompt food shortages in Ireland - infamously crippled by the th Century potato famine. But Ms Patel told The Times: Why hasnapost this point been pressed home during negotiations  The grammar school-educated Tory apparatchik was born in London to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the s and studied at Essex and Keele Universities. She worked for the Tories and Sir James Goldsmithaposs Referendum Party in the s before ing as William Hagueaposs deputy press secretary from  to  - eventually becoming an MP in . Civil liberties campaigners will be concerned about Ms Patelaposs appointment as Home Secretary. For many years she argued for theof capital punishment - though she says her mind has changed on the subject in recent years.    Foreign Secretary: Dominic Raab VOTED LEAVE  Dominic Raab is a hard Brexit backing, tax slashing right-wing ideologue who famously only learned how important the Dover-Calais trade route was for Britain after becoming Brexit Secretary. After crashing out of the race to succeed Theresa May, Mr Raab backed Boris Johnson and has been rewarded for his loyalty with one of the great offices of state. An ex-Foreign Office lawyer,  he left the civil service to become chief of staff to another former Brexit Secretary David Davis. He was elected MP for Esher and Walton in  and joined the government in , quickly rising through the ranks. Mr Raab in his short spell as Brexit Secretary admitted that he hadnapost fully read the Good Friday Agreement. In  Mr Raab said feminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots and said it was time for men to start burning their briefs. In  he said most food bank users were not languishing in poverty but were instead had cash flow problems and has branded Brits the worst idlers in the world. He will also be First Minister of State, which effectively makes him Deputy Prime Minister. Education Secretary: Gavin Williamson VOTED REMAIN Gavin Williamson was sacked as Defence Secretary over leaks from the National Security Council. That was  days ago. Heaposs now ing to frontline politics as Secretary of State for Education. Itaposs unclear whether this also signals ato government for Cronus the tarantula. Business Secretary: Andrea Leadsom VOTED LEAVE Andrea Leadsom resigned from Theresa Mayaposs cabinet a little over two months ago in protest against her Brexit Strategy. She stood in the election to replace Mrs May, but was eliminated in the first round of voting. She placed eighth out of  candidates, attracting just  votes from her fellow Tory MPs. Culture Secretary:Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: Theresa Villiers VOTED LEAVE Theresa Villiers will replace Michael Gove as Environment Secretary.It marks ato Cabinet for the former Northern Ireland Secretary, who served for four years from .Villiers was one of the six Cabinet ministers who came out in support of Brexit during the EU referendum. Following the referendum, on  July , Villiers resigned from her position as Northern Ireland Secretary after saying that Theresa May had offered her a post outside the Cabinet which was not one which I felt I could take on. But despite solid Brexit credentials in the eyes of Team Boris, Villiers may not survive the next election, she has a majority of just  votes in her seat of Chipping Barnet. Culture Secretary: Nicky Morgan VOTED REMAIN The former Education Secretary was once part of the Tories’ pro-EU wing that proved awkward for May. But her acceptance of the result, and her support for Johnson during the leadership contest, meant ato Cabinet was likely. MP for the marginal seat of Loughborough, she impressed at Education after being drafted in to repair the damage to relations with teachers inflicted by Michael Gove. At Culture, her job will be to revive the ministry which some believe has suffered under the lacklustre leadership of Jeremy Wright. The job is known in Westminster as “Minister for Fun” because perks include free tickets to major sporting events, film and music award ceremonies, and nights at the opera or pop concerts. Morgan will certainly bring more spark to the role than Wright, but she will have had to convince Johnson she will fully back his fallback plan for a no-deal Brexit. International Development Secretary: Alok Sharma VOTED REMAIN  The MP for Reading West was expected to reach the Cabinet table for the first time after spending three years as a junior minister. The married dad-of-two, , attended the private Reading Blue Coat school and the University of Salford before qualying as a Deloitte chartered accountant. He spent  years in banking including investment banking before joining Parliament in . He was made a Foreign Office minister in  followed by the Communities Department and Department for Work and Pensions. Last year he faced shouts of apospathetic!apos as he tried to deny Universal Credit was forcing people to food banks - something his boss Amber Rudd later admitted. He also admitted the DWP dropped the ball when a scathing internal report on the benefit was published almost  months late. He voted Remain in the  EU referendum. Transport Secretary: Grant Shapps VOTED LEAVE BUT HAS SINCE CHANGED HIS MIND An unexpectedto the Cabinet for Grant Shapps, who has been out of the top team since . He was demoted by David Cameron from his job as party co-chairman and Minister without Portfolio after revelations about his second job and use of the assumed names Michael Green and Sebastian Fox. His demotion came after he admitted to having over-firmly denied having had a second job while he was an MP. Scotland Secretary: Alister Jack VOTED LEAVE Alister Jackaposs appointment was met with a resounding who in the corridors of Westminster. And with good reason. Heaposs only been an MP since .In just two years, heaposs managed to have had a role on the Treasury Select Committee, be appointed an aide to Andrea Leadsom and be made an Assistant Government Whip. And now heaposs in the Cabinet. Chief Secretary to the Treasury: Rishi Sunak VOTED LEAVE Local Government Minister Mr Sunak is considered a rising star of the Conservative Party.He is seen as a capable media performer and a confident politician with detail.An early backer of Boris Johnson, Mr Sunak was wheeled out by his campaign to defuse accusations that their candidate was a racist. In the Brexit referendum, Mr Sunak backed leaving the European Union.A former entrepreneur he worked in Calornia as an investor before in  winning the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Richmond in Yorkshire, after former leader William Hague stood down. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy, daughter of Indian businessman and billionaire N. R. Narayana Murthy. Housing minister: Esther McVey VOTED LEAVE Itaposs a demotion from her previous job as Work and Pensions Secretary, but welfare slasher Esther McVey has been brought back into the cabinet as a Housing Minister. Universities Minister: Jo Johnson VOTED REMAIN Boris Johnson has given his brother Jo his old job back. Johnson Jr was minister for Universities and Science from , until Theresa May moved him to transport in . He quit as a minister in November so he could back a second Brexit referendum. It will be interesting to see what he doesit looks like weaposre heading for no-deal. Paymaster General: Oliver Dowden VOTED REMAIN A paid-up member of the political establishment, Mr Dowden rose through the ranks of Conservative wonkery before ending up in No as an adviser to David Cameron, and promoted to deputy chief of staff. He once joked to an American interviewer that his job as a special advisor was day-to-day crisis management and he is seen by Tory insiders as a safe pair of hands.In  Mr Dowden, who is called aposOliveapos by friends, was elected to the safe tory seat of Hertsmere in Hertfordshire in .He was also given a goodbye gong by departing PM and former Boss David Cameron becoming a  Commander of the Order of the British Empire.Mr Dowden backed Remain in the  referendum but has not joined the group of awkward Tory MPs opposing Brexit.But as a close ally of the Cameron project, his promotion will be a potential red flag to the Tory traditionalists and eurosceptic hardliners who have pushed Mr Johnson to power. BACKED: Promoted from within Chancellor of the Exchequer: Sajid Javid VOTED REMAIN A reluctant remainer in the referendum, Sajid Javid is a born-again Brexiteer and has been promoted to the second-highest job in government. Mr Javid ran for the leadership himself before swinging behind Mr Johnson in his race to be Prime Minister. Multi-millionaire banker Sajid Javid was the first Home Secretary from an ethnic minority. The son of a bus driver, he was elected MP for Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in  and was quickly identied a a rising star. The former City banker sat on the work and Pensions Select Committee, then the powerful Public Accounts Committee. Mr Javid, who comes from a Muslim background but does not practise any religion, was particularly close to Chancellor George Osborne and was appointed a Treasury Minister in September . He was elevated to the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in April of that year and became Business Secretary in May  after the Toriesapos shock election outright victory. He had a picture of Margaret Thatcher hanging on his wall at University. Defence Secretary: Ben Wallace  VOTED REMAIN Ben Wallace gets a promotion from Security Minister to the top job at the Ministry of Defence. Heaposs a married father of three and has been MP for Wyre and Preston North since May . According to his website, his first job after leaving school at  was as a ski instructor in Austria. He went on to enter Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Scots Guards aged . Heaposs also worked in the Aerospace industry. In his spare time, he enjoys rugby, skiing and horse racing. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: Michael Gove VOTED LEAVE Johnsonaposs former leadership rival - and the man who infamously torpedoed his last run at being Prime Minister - is back in the fold. Heaposll be Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Cabinet Office minister. But unlike his predecessor David Lidington, he wonapost be de facto Deputy PM. That job goes to Dominic Raab. Itaposll be a welcome change of pace for the former journalist, who has spent the last few years at DEFRA banning things. International Trade Secretary: Liz Truss VOTED REMAINLiz Truss has been moved to replace Liam Fox at the Department of International Trade. Sheaposs previously served as Environment Secretary, Justice Secretary and most recently Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Considering her passion for opening new pork markets and for ensuring the success of British cheese, sheaposll fit right in at DIT. Communities Secretary: Robert Jenrick Promoted from a junior Treasury role, Jenrick becomes the youngest member of Johnson Cabinet and one of the youngest in any Cabinet in recent years. He was elected to Parliament in a  by-election in Newark, Notts, triggered by the resignation of Patrick Mercer. Jenrick edited his student newspaper at Cambridge, and went on to become a solicitor, advising businesses and financial institutions on corporate law in London and Moscow, before quitting the profession and moving into business, before switching again, this time into politics. He has three young daughters with we Michal. Justice Secretary: Robert Buckland VOTED REMAIN Robert Buckland has been promoted from Prisons Minister to Johnsonaposs top man in the Ministry of Justice. Buckland is a qualied Barrister and one of the few Remainers left in the cabinet after todayaposs cull. He previously served as Solicitor General from -. Northern Ireland Secretary: Julian Smith VOTED REMAIN Theresa Mayaposs Chief Whip has been sent to possibly the least desirable job in the British Government. Heaposll be in charge of restoring power sharing to Northern Ireland. And then thereaposs the thorny question of finding a way to make the border work with neither a backstop or customs checkpoints. Minister without Portfolio and Conservative Party Chairman: James Cleverly VOTED LEAVE Former Army reservist James Cleverly gets bumped up from junior Brexit minister to Party chairman. Prior to Theresa Mayaposs last reshuffle, he was a deputy Party chair. After briefly standing in the leadership election, he shelved his own ambitions and became a loyal backer of Johnson through the rest of the campaign. Home Office Minister: Brandon Lewis VOTED LEAVE Brandon Lewis gets a ministerial role after  months as Chairman. His tenure as Party chief started out fairly badly. He faced calls for his resignation after it emerged security holes in the Tory Conference app had exposed the private mobile phone numbers of several senior minister to the internet. But it ended on a more positive note, having overseen a broadly successful leadership campaign. SACKED: Dumped from the Cabinet Foreign Secretary: Jeremy Hunt  In the most eye-popping move of the day, Johnsonaposs former leadership rival will be leaving Government entirely. Johnson sacked him as Foreign Secretary and he turned down another job. He tweeted: I would have been honoured to carry on my work at the Foreign Office but understand the need for a new Prime Minister to choose his team. Boris Johnson kindly offered me another role but after nine years in Cabinet  over  cabinet meetings now is the time toto the backbenches from where PM will have my full support. Iaposve been a cabinet minister for every hour my three gorgeous children have been alive. So whilst it may seem strange for someone who just tried to become PMI have decided now is the time for the biggest challenge of all - to be a GOOD DAD! It has been a huge honour to be responsible for the finest diplomatic service in the world  to see the courage  wisdom of our diplomats  intelligence services. Thanks for guiding me with such patience  professionalism! Proud to have stood up alongside you for British values. Also most importantly heartfelt thanks to the   of Conservative Party members who supported me. Despite being the outsider, the #HastobeHunt campaign was spirited  smart . I was truly humbled with the confidence placed in me by so many people. Defence Secretary and Women and Equalities Minister: Penny Mordaunt Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was made the first woman to hold the office after Gavin Williamson was sacked by Theresa May, has announced she will be ing to the backbenches. She said on Twitter: I’m heading to the backbenches from where the PM will have my full support, as will my successors at DefenceHQ  WomenEqualities. Thank you to everyone who’s helped me get things done, especially our Armed Forces and civilians in defence for the last  days. We achieved much. Itaposs currently unclearshe resigned or was sacked. International Trade Secretary: Liam Fox Liam Fox announced he would not be ing to Government, but he too failed to say whether it was by his choice or Johnsonaposs. He tweeted: Sadly, I will be leaving the Government. It has been a privilege to have served as Secretary of State for International Trade these past  years. I am proud to have worked with a tremendously talented team @tradegovuk to boost trade  investment and prepare for Brexit. The world-class trade department we have built leaves the UK uniquely well-positioned to forge our new trading relationships beyond Europe and create a truly Global Britain. But we must first undertake the momentous task of delivering on the instruction of the British people and leave the European Union. I look forward to supporting @BorisJohnson and the government from the backbenches. Business Secretary: Greg Clark Greg Clark more or less said he had been sacked in a statement issued on Twitter. He wrote: I warmly congratulate Boris Johnson on becoming Prime Minister. He is right to appoint a new team for a new premiership and I wish him and them well for the vital work ahead. It has been an honour to serve the country as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for the last  years and as Communities Secretary, Universities amp Science Minister, Cities Minister, Financial Secretary to the Treasury  Planning Minister. I am grateful for the support of outstanding civil servants, special advisors and ministerial colleagues during that time. I look forward to participating fully in the work of Parliament and continuing to serve the people of Tunbridge Wells. Education Secretary: Damian Hinds Education Secretary Damian Hinds has also departed from Boris Johnsonaposs cabinet. He said: It has been the greatest privilege to serve as Education Secretary. Thank you to the brilliant team at @educationgovuk. And thank you to everyone working in education and childrenaposs care, for all you do. I look forward to supporting the government from the backbenches. Communities Secretary: James Brokenshire Despite backing Johnson in the leadership contest, James Brokenshire is out of the Cabinet. His last act in office was to reinstate sacked aposphilosopherapos Roger Scruton to his government advisory role. Northern Ireland Secretary: Karen Bradley  Karen Bradley is reportedly out as Northern Ireland Secretary. Sheaposll perhaps be best remembered for admitting in public that she was profoundly ignorant of Northern Irelandaposs political isions. In an interview with the House Magazine, she said: I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland. Scotland Secretary: David Mundell Mundell says he was disappointed, but not surprised to be leaving the Scotland office. Thataposs him sacked then. He tweeted: Disappointed but not surprised to be leaving the Scotland Office after  years. Will, of course, support the new Government, but as I said to PM this afternoon I will also hold him to account on his commitments to the Union. Hope there’s still room on the backbenches! Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary: Jeremy Wright  Mr Wright, who never really seemed comfortable at the ministry of fun, is reportedly gone. Of course, weaposll never know for sure, because the ex-Digital minister is still not on Twitter. Immigration Minister : Caroline Nokes Ms Nokes was reportedly sacked as Immigration Minister. Her tweet announcing the news of her departure contains some brutal shade: My successor as Immigration Minister undoubtedly has a massive challenge ahead. Leader of the House of Commons: Mel Stride Mel Stride was Leader of the House for  days. Barely enough time to get comfortable before heading back to the Backbenches. He wrote: Huge honour to have served as Lord President and Leader of the House. Looking forward to continuing to support my constituents and our PM from backbenches. Huge thanks to all who supported me so brilliantly during my  yrs in govt - in the whips office, HMT and in Leader’s Office NO CHANGE Health Secretary: Matt Hancock VOTED REMAIN The only Health Secretary ever to have his own app is staying in charge of the NHS. The tech-obsessed MP, who once launched his own app, pulled out of the contest to replace Theresa May after he came sixth in the first round of MPs votes. The geeky son of software developers voted Remain in the Brexit referendum but has since backed Brexit. His achievements in government have been limited, with him finally settling the pay dispute with NHS staff negotiated by Jeremy Hunt his only real achievement. But in one of Westminsteraposs most precarious Cabinet jobs sometimes no news can be seen as good news. At just -years-old the former economist, who worked for both George Osborne and the Bank of England, is seen by more moderate Tories as a potential future leader. If he can survive unscathed, and untainted, by Boris Johnsonaposs government. Brexit Secretary: Stephen Barclay VOTED LEAVE Stephen Barclay has been rewarded for failing to secure a Brexit deal that MPs could back under Theresa May by being allowed to keep his job as Brexit Secretary. Stephen Barclay was appointed by Theresa May after both previous holders of the job - David Davis and Dominic Raab - quit over her plans for Brexit . Barclay - who calls himself Steve - is the -year-old MP for North East Cambridgeshire. The former Axa insurance lawyer and dad-of-two was born in , the son of a union official and civil servant, and grew up with three brothers who all played rugby. Work and Pensions Secretary: Amber Rudd VOTED REMAIN Amber Rudd has been rewarded for her latter-day conversion to accepting no-deal Brexit as an option by being allowed to keep her job. Sheaposs also been made Women and Equalities Minister, which was previously part of departing Defence Secretary Penny Mordauntaposs job. After backing the Remain campaign at the referendum, she said last week: The situation is that we are leaving at the end of October but it would be so much better to get a deal. What we really need is for everybody’s effort to go into trying to get a deal. Wales Secretary: Alun Cairns Alun Cairns has been Secretary of State for Wales since March , and Boris Johnson doesnapost see why he should stop now. He has run the London Marathon seven times. His personal best is h m s, making him the seventh fastest MP ever. CRACKED: Resigned from Cabinet Deputy PM: David Lidington  Theresa Mayaposs deputy David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, announced he was stepping down - and suggested heaposll now fight No Deal. The ardently pro-EU MP said he was relishing the chance to campaign freely on issues close to his heart. He wrote: After  yrs on the front bench itaposs the right moment to move on. I shall leave the govt when Theresa May offers her resignation to The Queen. I shall do all I can to help new govt secure a deal to allow an orderly departure from the EU. After more than two decades of collective responsibility Iaposm now relishing the prospect of speaking  campaigning freely for the things that matter to me  to my constituents. Chancellor: Philip Hammond  Philip Hammond confirmed he was getting ready to quit ahead of Boris Johnson taking over as PM. The Chancellor is vehemently opposed to crashing out of the UK without a deal. He said he wouldnapost wait to be sacked by Boris Johnson but rather planned to resign after Theresa Mayaposs last PMQs in place on Wednesday. In his resignation letterhe said: I believe that your successor must be free to choose a Chancellor who is fully aligned with his policy position.  Justice Secretary David Gauke served in Theresa Mayaposs Cabinet since she took office in June . He was so famed for his cool manner that he used to get uncorked by more senior Tories to face dficult questions. But he said he would not be able to serve under Boris Johnson. Given that Iaposve been in the Cabinet since Theresa May came to power, I think the appropriate thing is for me to resign to her, he said. Heaposs now tipped to form a Gaukeward Squad on the backbenches fighting against a No Deal Brexit . International Development Secretary: Rory Stewart The International Development Secretary announced during his brief run for the party leadership that he would not serve in a Boris Johnson government. He said on Twitter : Because of our dferences on Brexit and prorogation, I wouldn’t be able to serve in a Boris Johnson cabinet. And he confirmed it with a tweet congratulating Johnson on his victory, and saying he would be on the backbench tomorrow serving Cumbria. The tweet was accompanied by a picture of Stewart with two horses. Transport Secretary: Chris Grayling  Chris Grayling was paradoxically both one of the worst ministers ever and also one of the longest serving ministers of recent years. Itaposs now been confirmed he willto the backbenches. A source close to Chris Grayling has said he was not sacked, despite a litany of failures littering his career. They said: Chris packed up and said goodbye to his private office this morning. He’d told Boris he didn’t want to continue when he backed him.JUNIOR MINISTERS: Changes below Cabinet level ResignedAlan DuncanAnne MiltonBACKROOM TEAM: Bestof the rest IN: Dominic Cummings  Boris Johnson has hired the infamous former boss of the Vote Leave campaign to work as a senior advisor to him in government. MPs voiced their fury as Dominic Cummings ed to the top tier of British politics, just months after being found in contempt of Parliament. Mr Cummings is an abrasive former special advisor to Michael Gove who took on the blob of the teaching profession. He was then one of the architects of the official Vote Leave campaign, serving as its campaign director, during the EU referendum in . His famously bullish style was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in a TV drama on the infighting that plagued the Leave camp. He is said to have been a mastermind behind Vote Leaveaposs most controversial messages, including the bus that ly claimed we send £million a week to the EU and messages misleadingly claiming Turkey was joining the EU. He branded Tory Brexiteers in the ERG useful idiots, called top Tory David Davis thick as mince, claimed some Tory Brexiteers spent the referendum chasing girls and other Brexiteer economists were charlatans. IN: Andrew Grfiths Itaposs also emerged Johnson plans to make multi-millionaire Andrew Grfiths an advisor. Grfiths hit headlines last month after it emerged he had loaned Johnson his £.m Westminster townhouse to use as a campaign HQ. Labour ’s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Jon Trickett MP said: Before he is even appointed Prime Minister, one of Boris Johnsonaposs first acts is to dish out a powerful job in Number  to his super-rich pal who lent him his luxurious house in Westminster for the Tory leadership campaign. “The public would be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that Johnson’s friends can buy influence within the new administration. Itaposs blindingly obvious – Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite. OUT: Sir Mick Davis  Tory Party Treasurer and chief executive Sir Mick Davis said he was on the way out. It comes after the millionaire was forced to dig deep into his own pockets to keep the party funded under Theresa May. He said: I think that our new leader, Boris Johnson, should be free to choose a team at CCHQ who can work together to ensure that this organisation realises its central purpose – a clear and decisive victory at the next General Election.

On an achingly-hot day in Westminster, one Prime Minister finished her final speech outside No’s black door just  minutes before her successor delivered his first.Outgoing Theresa May was driven away from Downing Street - a home she never liked - at .pm to resign to the Queen after a touching address alongside her husband Philip.As well as flowers from well-wishers, she took with her grudging admiration and genuine respect for the burden she bore - but ultimately, she failed. At .pm, a dferent atmosphere took grip on sweltering central London - it was angrier, louder, fearful and even more ided.   Some  anti- Brexit and anti-EU rival protesters massed in Whitehall, one faction chanting “Stop Brexit!” the other hollering “Out now!” The police seemed more on edge as the new Prime Minister’s silver Jaguar XJL stopped ft short of the Downing Street podium - and Boris Johnson bound out to boos and jeers from campaigners pressing against metal crash barriers outside.His girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, shocked onlookers by appearing moments earlier to hear her lover’s first address as PM. She stood with Johnson supporters, chatting with his new chief of staff and smiling nervously. Any doubts about the passion and anger our new premier generates were quelled by the bubbling cauldron of rage steaming from the demonstrators  yards away behind the iron gates. In front of hundreds of clicking cameras, Johnson was visibly impatient, often teetering on the balls of his feet and thumping the mahogany lectern to hammer home a point.

Once a new leader has been selected by either a General Election or a party vote, the Queen has the job of officially asking themthey will form a Governmen t. Sheaposs worked with some real characters over the years, including Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and John Major. The Queen isnapost allowed to share her political views and never speaks about her relationships with the leaders, but there have been a few interesting reports. The Royal Familyaposs official website says the Monarch always has a aposspecial relationshipapos with whoever is leading her Government - so weaposve had a look back at some of the more interesting ones...   Margaret Thatcher The Queen and Mrs Thatcher apparently didnapost really get on.    In fact, a Buckingham Palace source told a diplomat the monarch actually considered scrapping their weekly meetings all together. Declassied files revealed in  claimed the Tory PM enraged the Queen by defying Commonwealth leaders in a vote over apartheid . Files from the National Archives of Ireland show that Thatcher sparked international anger after refusing to back tighter sanctions against South Africa. The move had been agreed by  leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Vancouver, Canada, but Mrs Thatcher refused, thwarting efforts to end apartheid and enraging heads of state.    An Irish diplomat based in London reported back to Dublin that it was widely regarded that the PM had “blundered badly” and “she well knows but cannot admit her mistake”. After speaking with a source at Buckingham Palace, he sent a confidential message to the Taoiseach’s office. The diplomat wrote: “There is a wide view too that the Queen is in a rage with Mrs Thatcher over her handling of the sanctions .” Using the nickname Brenda, which was given to the Queen by satirical magazine Private Eye, the diplomat continued: “A source in the palace said that ‘Brenda’ was seriously considering cancelling last night’s Tuesday audience with the prime minister. This audience... has existed for more than a century.” Winston Churchill Churchill was the first PM the Queen worked with after her fatheraposs early and tragic death. They were reportedly very close, and he was said to be a formidable presence for the young monarch, who was just  at the time. Nicholas Soames, Churchillaposs grandson, said: I think the Queen valued my grandfatheraposs experience, and he of course loved the Queen. He did love her.    I mean, she aroused in him all his romantic ideas of sovereignty and monarchy. Royal historian Robert Lacey added: I think there’s a sense in which all the Queen’s Prime Ministers have been in love with her to a certain degree. But it was most overtly displayed by Churchill. He made no pretence at it, there were tears in his eyes when he welcomed her. The Queen send Churchill a handwritten letter after he retired in  saying how much she missed him She  wrote that no other PM would would ever for me be able to hold the place of my first prime minister, to whom both my husband and I owe so much and for whose wise guidance during the early years of my reign I shall always be so profoundly grateful.    After Churchillaposs death in  she broke royal protocol by arriving at his funeral before his family did. The Queen is supposed to be the last person to arrive at any official occasion - including a State Funeral - but the Monarch decided to get there before his grieving relatives. Nicholas explained what the Queen’s gesture meant to his family in the TV show. He said: It is absolutely exceptionalnot unique for the Queen to grant precedence to anyone. For her to arrive before the coffin and before my grandfather was a beautul and very touching gesture. Tony Blair Tony Blair has spoken on a number of occasions about how he felt he could tell the Queen absolutely anything, knowing it would never go any further. In an interview with the BBC he said: There is nothing you canapost say to the Queen. Speaking for a  documentary called aposMonarchy: The Royal Family at Workapos, he said: I’ve told her about lots of things in my time.    You know, everything from Cherie being pregnant with Leo through to, you know, major decisions. Because the one thing you know is that she will never ulge anything to anyone. However in his  book Comparative Politics: A Policy Approach foreign affairs writer Michael J Kryzanek said he believed the Queen and Blairaposs audiences probably were perfunctory. He said: Although Mr Blair’s reform of the aristocratic Lords and his Labour  Party’s traditional public criticism of the monarchy would likely mean that the weekly discussion between the two is perfunctory.    In  Labouraposs Tony Blair was slammed for snubbing the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations to sun himself in the Males. The ex-Prime Minister was invited to pay his respects in person but instead went for a holiday and sent a video tribute. Tory MP Priti Patel said: “He should be ashamed of himself. He spends a huge amount of time ­gallivanting round the world.” Buckingham Palace said: “There would have been no offence taken.” Anthony Eden Things were more formal between the Queen and Anthony Eden, who took over from Churchill. However it is reported that at one of their audiences they stayed clear of political chat and instead just listened as US astronaut John Glenn went into space on the radio.  Alec Douglas-Home The Queen reportedly spoke to Douglas-Home like an old friend, discussing dogs and going shooting together. Harold Wilson The Queen reportedly used to invite the Labour MP to join the Royals for picnics in Balmoral.  James Callaghan Mr Callaghan once said of the Queen: One of the great things about her is that she always seems able to see the funny side of le. All the conversations were very enjoyable. Sir John Major Major was well liked by the Royal Family as he has shown a deeply care for Princes William and Harry. After Dianaaposs death in  he was appointed specialto Princes Harry and William, and was responsible for legal and administrative matters.  Major, whose appointment was reported to have been made at the suggestion of Prince Charles, was asked to protect the interests of Harry and William in negotiations over their mother’s will. Lawyers for Sir John even went to court to seek powers to protect the princesapos financial interest in souvenirs and memorabilia related to their late mother the Princess of Wales. He was the only politician to be invited to Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs Royal Wedding last year.  Kensington Palace sources stressed in the run up to the wedding that those at the ceremony would be picked due to their relationship with the couple rather than the positions they hold.

Along with former death penalty supporter Priti Pateland Thatcherite former banker Sajid Javid , his promotion marks a clean sweep of right-wingers in the great offices of state.So who is the MP, and why has he stirred controversy  He sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty. When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list. He branded feminists obnoxious bigots. And he put out a pamphlet in  that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under . Hereaposs a profile - and  things you should probably know.  Former grammar school boy Mr Raab, now , was born to a Czech Jewish father who fled to Britain as a refugee before the Second World War. The Oxford and Cambridge graduate was a City lawyer with Linklaters before joining the Foreign Office in , helping bring war criminals to justice in The Hague. He once found himself defending Tony Blair from being summoned to the international criminal court while working on the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. He left the civil service for hard politics in  becoming chief of staff to Tory shadow home secretary David Davis. He was elected MP for Esher and Walton in  and joined government in , quickly rising through the ranks. During his time as a junior minister in the Ministry of Justice, Mr Raab tried to get prisoners with sentences of longer than a year deported. He also led debates against a European Court of Justice decision giving at least some prisoners the right to vote. In July  he replaced David Davis as Brexit Secretary - probably the most crucial and stressful job in government. But he lasted just five months in the role, resigning in November  in protest of Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal.   He stepped down just hours after Theresa May published her -page Brexit deal, accusing the Prime Minister of betraying public trust. He later ran for the Tory leadershipbut lent his support to Boris Johnson when he was knocked out. He lives in Thames Ditton, Surrey, with his we Erika and two sons Peter and Joshua and his heroes include right-wing US President Ronald Reagan and Gandhi.  Mr Raab is a hardliner who wants to take a aposstrongmanapos approach to the EU - and was willing to crash out in a No Deal Brexit on October he had become Tory leader. He backed Brexit before the  EU referendum and was on the political advisory board of Leave Means Leave - which branded Theresa Mayaposs plans fake Brexit and a total, humiliating capitulation. He previously said he was relaxed about the prospect of crashing out of the EU with no deal. And after declaring his leadership bid, he confirmed: I would fight for a fairer deal in Brussels with negotiations to change the backstop arrangements. If not I would be clear that we would leave on WTO terms in October. We need to go out and be absolutely resolute in the way we werenapost last time. aposWTO termsapos are the harshest trading terms with another country - the basic default. Theyaposre a No Deal Brexit. Chancellor Philip Hammond refused to rule out voting no-confidence in a Tory government that went for a No Deal Brexit.  As a Tory leadership candidate, Mr Raab even refused to rule out some kind of pact with Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party.  He stressed thereaposd be no formal coalition but stopped well short of ruling out co-operation entirely. Askedhe could do business with Mr Farage, the former minister said: Look, I always listen to all sides of this debate, from Nigel Farage to others. But no, I would lead a Conservative team, uniting all the dferent aspects of the Conservative Party around a cabinet table. When askedas leader he would enter an electoral pledge with Mr Farage, he said he had no plans for that. He added: Thataposs not what I would be aiming for. My aim is not to cosy up with other parties, my aim is to keep Conservative promises, present an optimistic, aspirational vision of the future, then go and beat Jeremy Corbyn .  Nine years of cruel Tory austerity cuts slashed services to the bone while failing to wipe out the deficit by , as ministers had promised. Yet it seems Dominic Raab once again was looking at this approach as a leadership candidate - not to balance the books this time, but to give people a huge tax cut. He wants to reduce the basic rate of income tax from p to p over time - including a p drop straight away - and lower national insurance by raising the threshold. Mr Raab claimed there was £bn of headroom in the public finances to make the move. But he also admitted itaposd involve slashing back government through efficiency savings - a front often used for cuts in David Cameronaposs era. He told the BBC: We would have a spending review... cut down the number of Whitehall departments, cut out the bureaucracy, Iaposd have a special commission looking at public sector procurement particularly in the NHS and MOD. Then I would recycle roughly half of that into frontline services - teachers, schools, nurses - and half of that into the tax cuts for the future.  At the time Dominic Raab was Brexit Secretary when he revealed he aposhadnapost understoodapos the importance of trade with France. Seventeen per cent of the UK’s trade in goods, or £ billion annually, goes through Dover to either Calais or Dunkirk, according to port officials.  But speaking at a London tech event, Mr Raab said: “I hadn’t quite understood the full extent of this, butyou look at the UK and you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing. . And he didnapost read the full Good Friday Agreement either He also admitted he hadnapost read the Good Friday Agreement - crucial to peace in Northern Ireland - start to finish. At ious points in the negotiations, when issues have been raised, it has been an important opportunity to delve into the dferent aspects very carefully, he told MPs. “It’s not like a novel where you sit down and you say ‘do you know what, over the holidays, this is a cracking read’. . Heaposs raised the idea of a Brexit tax haven  Dominic Raab raised the prospect of a radical corporation tax cut from % to % in a No Deal Brexit. This would make the rate the lowest in the G by a country mile - handing global firms a huge tax break while millions of working families struggle. He made the bombshell suggestion on the fringes of the  Tory conference in a discussion about No Deal, while he was Brexit Secretary. Mr Raab was asked his view on an idea by Chloe Westley, of the right-wing TaxPayers Alliance think tank, of dropping corporation tax to % - and using tax to get a “post-Brexit boom”. The then-Cabinet minister replied: “You just said Chloe wants to reduce corporation tax to % - and the Chancelloraposs talked about reserving fiscal firepower in the case of no deal. What more do you want  “Of course heaposs talking about the recognition that actually, in the no deal scenario, we want to pull every lever weaposve got to see us through what short term buffeting or disruption we have. “I think the Chancellor gave a brilliant speech and it shows you weaposre all rowing the same boat.”  Mr Raab sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty - even though benefit delays and sanctions are the main reason for people using the handouts. He claimed: The typical user of a foodbank is not someone thataposs languishing in poverty, itaposs someone who has a cash flow problem episodically.  . He branded calls for NHS cash a aposchildish wish listapos When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he dismissed her calls for cash as a childish wish list. He told an election debate in : The money’s got to come from somewhere. I can think of lots of things that I would like to avoid making dficult decisions on and lots of areas like the health service or schools that I want to put even more money in. But unless you’ve got a strong economy creating the revenue, it’s just a childish wish list. . He had some worrying views on workersapos rights  Mr Raab has some worrying views on workersapos rights, including scaling back the minimum wage. He put forward proposals in a pamphlet published by the Centre for Policy Studies in  entitled aposEscaping the Strait Jacketapos. Raabaposs pamphlet included proposals to:Abolish the minimum wage for workers aged under  working in small businesses Abolish the working time directive which protects workers from having to work unfair hours Scrap employment rights for agency workers’ rights and conditions End transfer of undertakingsregulations protecting workers when their job is transferred to a new employer Ensure workers employed by small businesses donapost benefit from flexible working rights or pension auto-enrolment. He branded feminists aposobnoxious bigotsapos In  Mr Raab said feminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots and said it was time for men to start burning their briefs. He defended the remarks in . He had written: While we have some of the toughest anti-discrimination laws in the world, we are blind to some of the most flagrant discrimination – against men. From the cradle to the grave, men are getting a raw deal. . He was in a Facebook group calling for NHS privatisation In February , BuzzFeed revealed he belonged to a Facebook group which argued for all of Britain’s council housing to be sold off and the NHS to be privatised. Mr Raab said he wasnapost aware of the group, had inadvertently and mistakenly been linked to it and needless to say I do not support its aims.” . He branded Brits aposthe worst idlers in the worldapos  In , Mr Raab was one of five Tory MPs who branded Britons “the worst idlers in the world”. Their book argued: “Too many people in Britain, we argue, prefer a lie-in to hard work. We must get on the side of the responsible, the hard working and the brave. We must stop bailing out the reckless, avoiding all risk, and rewarding laziness. Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor.” . He got embroiled in a row about housing stats  In April , Mr Raab was embroiled in an embarrassing row with the official statistics watchdog after he claimed immigration has made house prices soar. The Tory minister dramatically declared migration has made prices rise something like % over the last  years. But the statistics he used were not public - and it was claimed the body that drew them up has not even existed since . Ed Humpherson, Head of the UK Statistics Authority’s Office for Statistics Regulation said: “Where analysis is quoted in public debate, the UK Statistics Authority believes it is essential that it be made equally available to all. “We have been speaking to officials at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government about the Minister’s statements on migration and housing.” . He revealed he had faced a claim of bullying, which he added was aposapos and aposunsubstantiatedapos Mr Raab attempted to outflank hostile rumours in March  by confirming he had faced an accusation of bullying in a previous job. He told The Sunday Times the claims, which date back to before he was an MP, were completely ”. Mr Raab worked for then-shadow ministers David Davis and Dominic Grieve in the years before becoming an MP in . He said: “In , in a previous role before I became an MP, I was subject to a claim of bullying. I vigorously denied the claims, which were independently investigated and found to be unsubstantiated. The claim that I secured an injunction or any kind of ‘gagging’ order is .” . And of course, thereaposs his diary secretary - with her clams about his lunch Mr Raab also shot into headlines after a Mirror investigation exposed his diary secretary selling sex online. He denied her claims that he had exactly the same Pret a Manger lunch each day - a chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, superfruit pot and the vitamin volcano smoothie. “He is so weird. I get it for him. I go to Pret. That’s how I know. It’s the Dom Raab Special, the diary secretary said. Mr Raab said: Itaposs not actually true.

The scheme is being announced today - on what is expected to be the hottest July day on record, with temperatures hitting C. The ‘maximum workplace temperature’ rule will protect workers and force bosses to introduce effective heat controls. Most workers in the UK have no legal safeguards protecting them from working during uncomfortably high temperatures or dangerous extreme heat.    The current guidance states a minimum working temperature but does not include an upper limit.Under Labour ’s plan: If the indoor workplace temperature goes over C , employers will have to put in place effective temperature controls to help workers keep cool. These would include measures that many good employers already take: flexible working and travel arrangements, extra breaks, access to water, cooling systems air conditioning, flexible dress codes or the provision of protective clothing. Labour will task a proposed Royal Commission on Health and Safety at Work with bringing forward realistic proposals to protect all workers – including all outdoor workers - from extreme or uncomfortable temperatures at work.Laura Pidcock MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Labour, said: “As we’re all being reminded this week, working in hot conditions is really uncomfortable, often stressful and it makes us less productive and even ill. Plus it’s often the lowest paid and most insecure workers who suffer the most. “That’s why the next Labour government will demand that employers look after the needs of their workers during heatwaves like this. We believe everyone should have the right to basic protections from working in unbearably hot conditions. “Climate change is already making our shops, offices, call-centres and other workplaces too hot, and it’s also threatening the safety and health of old people, babies and many others.

The unexpected closure of Monster Munchies has left brides-to-be without catering packages, decorations, DJs, dance floors and photo booths ahead of their big day. Samantha Cox and Darren Bott, who ran the firm, ceased trading last week, claiming they were aposvictims of their own successapos.A aposheartbrokenapos Ms Cox reached out to stressed-out customers with a post on her personal Facebook page, where she apologised for letting them down and explained there was a plan of action in place after seeking legal and financial advice, reports Birmingham Live. But the explanation provided little comfort for one bride-to-be, who was left in limbo just nine days before her big day. Since , Helen Hawthorne had paid the couple £, for a iety of services, including decorations, a DJ and photography. The -year-old, who is due to say aposI doapos on Saturday , found out about the firmaposs struggles online and immediately contacted the couple, demanding answers. Eventually, Ms Cox responded to an email, informing Miss Hawthorne that as she was aposlocalapos, the booking would be honoured - but by then it was too late. I told her weaposd already had to look at other suppliers as we had no ideatheyaposd show up on the day. We later found out that three other brides had been booked in on that day. Iaposd also seen her selling equipment online, so we had to look where. I asked for a refund but she said it wasnapost something that could be done quickly. Miss Hawthorne, of Walsall Wood, said the whole experience made her ill, adding: I didnapost sleep for three days.    We have managed to get other suppliers but Iaposm so angry that weaposve had to borrow money from our families to make sure weaposll have what weaposve already paid for. Another customer, who wished to remain anonymous, said she had booked a £ package, which included a flower wall and DJ, for her upcoming nuptuals. After the -year-old handed over a £ deposit, plus a £ apostravel feeapos, she was horried to stumble across a Facebook page that featured numerous bad reviews about the firm. People were saying that she hadnapost turned up on the day and had let them down, she said. I contacted her and asked for my money back but I was told the deposit was non-refundable but I could cancelI wanted to. The mother-of-two said Ms Cox offered her  chair covers and sashes as compensation - but onlysheaposd travel to pick them up. I didnapost want to spend any more money - itaposs a long way, I live in South East London  - and whatshe didnapost turn up  I just feel gutted about the whole situation. Iaposm an intelligent person but I just feel so foolish. The brides who were getting married at the weekend were devastated, they were left with no services or money. A support group for customers has been set up on Facebook - with members claiming they have spend an total of £, on services that were undelivered. However the group - which is one of many - is just fuelling the fire, according to Ms Cox, who insists they are doing the decent thing, regardless of what people think or say. Her statement said: We never set out to fraud or scam anyone despite a lot of lies flying around about us at present. We started our business in  and ran it very successfully for many years. But unfortunately we became victims of our own success and cracks began to appear. We managed to hold it together for a very long time. Things started to go wrong when other people got involved. Some unhappy customers and trolls began telling people to cancel our services so any money that was made was used to make refunds. This increased until any revenue we had we were having to use to pay back. This left no money for future bookings. At this time we are in receipt of no benefits, no tax credits, nothing. We relied solely on this business to pay our rent or lock up rent, van hire, travel costs, bills and anything  to do with the business. It soon became apparent that we were robbing Peter to pay Paul so relied on future bookings.  We NEVER intentionally took money to fraud anyone and had every intention of doing everyoneaposs bookings. Ms Cox said the decision to wrap up the business was taken on Tuesday night, adding her partner had contacted as many people as possible explaining the current situation.

What she didnapost realise - as the sun beat down on her - was that something was going on below her waist. It was only when she got home and stripped off her branded Adidas leggings that she realised what had happened. The logo of the sportswear company had been negatively branded onto her skin, with the burnt red area around the letters highlighting the pale skin of the German clothing firm. It was when I went to put on my bikini that I saw my leg, Danielle said. I thought aposOh my godapos. I was in fits of laughter.  Suspecting that the logo will fade from her leg by the morning, the Poole, Dorset woman was quick to capitalise on the unusual occurence. As well as collecting loads of shares when she posted it online, Danielle contacted Adidas askingthey would hire her as an on-brand model. Sadly the company turned down her request, complementing her on a nice tan before admitting it only took sponsorship bids from Australia and Germany. Danielle seems to have drawn a particularly unlucky card.    According to Bupa, leggings are typically a very good item of clothing to stave off sunburn. Long pants or leggings cover more skin than shorts, and a broad brim hat provides more protection than a baseball cap, the private health firm explained.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the

Niels resides in Calornia where he plays golf on the college circuit but he was raised in Campbeltown where his mum still works in the local hospital.He has been a member of Machrihanish Golf Club for  years since the age of four. Always a very promising junior, Niels announced his arrival in style at the championship on Saturday.His round began rather innocuously with a bogey five at the world-famous first hole. However, he followed that bogey by birdieing the second, third and fourth holes to take him to two-under-par through four.Another birdie on the eighth took him out in  shots, three under par.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"junior girls great carradale canter champions","story":"Kirstie finished last Sunday#s race, which took her through Carradale#s streets and woodland, in  minutes and  seconds.She was closely followed by second-placed under- girl, Niamh Quinn, who finished in  minutes and  seconds.Both girls were ahead of second-placed ladies# k finisher, Margaret Sinclair, and Kirstie ed home just before first-placed lady, Amy Armour.More than  athletes competed in the event, now in its fth year.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

trail, and Law Primary School teacher Valerie Duncan was chosen as one of the artists invited to decorate one of the public artworks.Her design, entitled Natural Healing, is on display at Waverley Bridge in Edinburgh.Valerie, who is also a volunteer with Girlguiding East Lothian, said she was inspired by nature to create her Oor Wullie.She said: ldquoHaving been successfully selected to design and paint one of the Oor Wullie sculptures, I spent a week in April bringing my design to le.ldquoI had some aching muscles and very sore knees after crawling around the larger-than-le sculpture to make sure I hadnrsquot missed any bits.ldquoMy design is inspired by the healing properties found in plants and the positive impact nature can have on peoplersquos wellbeing.The public are being encouraged to download a mobile app to follow their local trails and vote for their favourite sculptures.Donations and funds raised by auctioning off the work at the end of the trail will be split between three charities: Edinburgh Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity, Glasgow Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity and the ARCHIE Foundation.While Valerie joined the other artists creating the public sculptures, primary schools and nursery classes were able to apply for a mini sculpture of their own to decorate and came up with a wide range of ideas and costumes for Oor Wullie.Gullane Primary Schoolrsquos nursery classes worked together on Gracious Greg from Gullane ndash inspired by their learning on Holi festival, their statue was decorated with colourful handprints and fingerprints to celebrate love, kindness and friendship.Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, Musselburgh, created a design inspired by their home town dubbed Oor Mussy Wullie, while Preston Tower Primary School in Prestonpans gave their sculpture an environment theme as Oor Earth Wullie, highlighting the importance of caring for the planet and not dropping litter.Pupils came up with lots of ideas for their decorations in competitions across the schools.At Cockenzie Primary School, Natasha OrsquoConnor, depute headteacher, said it had been impossible to choose a winning design from youngsters so they combined them.She said: ldquoThere were so many fantastic entries that we ended up doing a combined design of a number of entries.ldquoIt mainly features a sea and fishing boat pattern on his

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

So, that is a real concern to her, yes.Mrs May was also warned about the impact of a no-deal by her Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who identied it as potential fuel for the Scottish independence movement.Both Northern Ireland and Scotland voted Remain in the  EU referendum.Earlier this month, Mr Mundell wrote in a newspaper that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would seize on a disorderly Brexit ldquowith unseemly glee.He said: ldquoA dficult no-deal Brexit would not only damage our economy, it would fuel nationalist claims of a UK that is insensitive to Scotlandrsquos needs.ldquoThe new prime minister faces considerable challenges, and the future of the UK is high on the list.With Boris Johnson saying he is ready to embrace no-deal in order to achieve Brexit by October  - a point he made again in his first Downing Street address as Prime Minister - the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford told Radio : ldquoI think as it stands today he could be the last prime minister of the United Kingdom."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-predicts-female-prime-ministers-stands","story":"Responding to the longest serving female MP, the Mother of the House Harriet Harman, at PMQs, Mrs May she was one of just  female Tory MPs when she was first elected in .She said: ldquoIndeed, one Labour Member of Parliament approached me to encourage me to sign a private Memberrsquos Bill list because he assumed that, as a woman, I must have been a Labour Member of Parliament.ldquoI am proud to have played my part in getting more women MPs in this House. I am sure that among the women in this House today there is a future Prime Minister - perhaps more than one.Referring to Mrs Mayrsquos first meeting with President Donald Trump, Ms Harman offered ldquoa word of sisterly advice - sometimes, you just have to be a bit more careful when a man wants to hold your hand.The new LibDem leader Jo Swinson told Mrs May it was ldquoinspiring for girls in her East Dunbartonshire seat to see a female First Minister of Scotland and UK Prime Minister.In a dig at Boris Johnson, she asked Mrs Mayrsquos advice for women ldquoon how to deal with those men who think they could do a better job but are not prepared to do the actual work Mrs May congratulated Ms Swinson on her new position, and said she was pleased to see an MP with a Scottish seat in a UK role, underlining the Union.She said: ldquoAs I stand down, I am pleased to be able to hand the baton on to another female leader of a political party.ldquoAs I look around the Chamber, I have to say that we almost have a full set. My party has had two women leaders, the Liberal Democrats now have a woman leader, and the SNP has a woman leader, as does the DUP, Plaid and the Greens.ldquoEven the independent TIGger group, Change UK, or whatever they are calling themselves this week, are now on to their second woman leader.ldquoThere is only one party in this House letting the side down: the Labour party."},{"url":null,"title":"may-bows-parting-commons-jab-corbyn","story":"After a tetchy final exchange with the Labour leader, she said: ldquoAs a party leader who has accepted when her time was up, perhaps the time is now for him to do the same Independent MP Ian Austin, who quit Labour over its ldquoculture of anti-Semitism in February, later told Mrs May he associated himself ldquocompletely with her ldquofine answer, adding: ldquoItrsquos absolutely clear to me that the vast majority of Labour MPs agree with her too.Mrs May last week made Mr Austin, the MP for Dudley North, a trade envoy to Israel.The comments about Mr Corbyn were a rare sour note in a PMQs in which MPs generally praised Mrs May for her commitment to public service -not her lasting achievements - and implicitly contrasted her dedication with her successorrsquos record and attitude.Mrs May was cheered as she entered a packed chamber shortly before noon, and drew attention to her husband Philip watching from the gallery.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Theresa May pleased to hand over to Boris Johnson\",\"description\": \"Theresa May pleased to hand over to Boris Johnson\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs QCxRGbCX-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests QCxRGbCX.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": After more than an hour fielding questions - a record for PMQs - her voice cracked as she said her duty now would be to serve her Maidenhead constituency from the backbenches.She said: ldquoThat duty to serve my constituents will remain my greatest motivation.As she left to make her way back to Downing Street, she received a standing ovation from Tory, LibDem and DUP MPs, while most of Labour and the SNP remained silent.The tone of the set-piece occasion was set by Labour MP Ruth Cadbury, who said she ldquoprofoundly disagreed with many of Mrs Mayrsquos decisions and policies, but recognised her ldquorespect for public service and for the future of our country.In the first of many swipes at Boris Johnson, Ms Cadbury continued: ldquoSo how does she feel about handing over to a man who, among many things, is happy to demonise Muslims, is prepared to chuck our loyal public servants and diplomats under a bus, and promises to sell our country out to Donald Trump and his friends Mrs May said she was ldquopleased to hand over to an incoming leader of the Conservative party and Prime Minister who I worked with when he was in my Cabinet, and who is committed, as a Conservative who stood on a Conservative manesto in , to delivering on the vote of the British people in  and to delivering a bright future for this country.Mr Corbyn praised Mrs Mayrsquos ldquosense of public duty.He said: ldquo I hope she has a marginally more relaxing time on the Back Benches. Perhaps, like the Chancellor, she will even help me oppose the reckless plans of her successor.When Tory MPs jeered, he added: ldquoI am glad the Government party is in such good heart today. Tomorrow it wonrsquot be.The Labour leader then highlighted increases in child poverty, violent crime, NHS waiting times, food bank use and school class sizes during Mrs Mayrsquos three years in office.ldquoDoes the Prime Minister have any regrets about any of those things Irsquove just said Mrs May said it was very good to see her party in good heart, adding: ldquoIt is more than I can say for the Labour Party.She went on: ldquoLet me just say something about my record over the past three years and how I measure it. It is in the opportunity for every child who is now in a better school. It is in the comfort for every person who now has a job for the first time in their le. It is in the hope of every disadvantaged young person now able to go to university.

Politics is about the dference we make every day to the lives of people up and down this country.

It is why I am ending the postcode lottery for survivors of domestic abuse.ldquoIt is why the Race Disparity Audit and gender pay reporting are shining a light on inequality, so it has nowhere to hide.\"And that is why I set up the independent public inquiry into the tragedy at Grenfell Tower ndash to search for the truth, so nothing like it can ever happen again, and so the people who lost their lives that night are never forgotten.Perhaps history will be kinder to Mrs May than many of her colleagues.All the same, it must have stung a little when she saw the recent front cover of Private Eye.Publishing its ldquoTheresa May memorial issue at the beginning of June, the satirical magazine used its front page to list her legacy in full.It was blank."},{"url":null,"title":"commonwealth-games-voted-top-moment-scottish-tourism","story":"Glasgowrsquos colourful and kitsch opening ceremony for the  Commonwealth Games five years ago this week kick-started  blistering hot days of sport and left its mark on a global audience who saw the city at its vibrant and colourful best.Now the huge sporting event ndash which brought around , visitors to Scotland as a direct result of the Games ndash has been voted the greatest moment in Scottish tourism.A poll created by tourism agency VisitScotland to mark its th anniversary today, has placed the Glasgow  Commonwealth Games as the biggest catalyst for bringing visitors to Scotland.The Games, which saw  athletes from  dferent nations and territories competing across  dferent sports, bagged  per cent of the votes and topped a string of events regarded as having a dramatic impact on tourist numbers.Included in the top five most important moments is the decision by Rough Guide readers to name Scotland as the most beautul country in the world.Scotland polled ahead of Canada and New Zealand in second and third places respectively, with lashings of praise for its ldquowild beaches, deep lochs and craggy castles and recommendation to tourists to visit Edinburghrsquos Old Town, Stirling Castle, Glen Coe and the beaches of South Harris.The Rough Guide listing ndash at a time when the exchange rate was already encouraging increasing numbers of American visitors - prompted tourism leaders at the time to predict an influx of extra tourists.The poll also highlights Scotlandrsquos leading role in blockbuster cinema and television dramas as helping to boost visitor numbers.The release of Braveheart in  was voted third most impactful event, taking % of the vote. The Mel Gibson epic sparked a surge in interest in Scotland and its history leading to a boost in visitor numbers for the National Wallace Monument in Stirling ndash leaping from , a year to nearly , in .The hugely popular Outlander book and later TV series are also regarded as key moments, along with the  Disney animation, Brave, which featured the voices of Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane and Kelly Macdonald.Large events which brought tourists flooding to Glasgow in particular also made the top , including the  Glasgow Garden Festival and Glasgowrsquos role as the City of Culture.Perhaps surprisingly, the top  of key moments does not include the opening of the Skye Bridge in , spanning Loch Alsh and connecting Kyle of Lochalsh with the island.The toll-free bridge is widely regarded as being key to the islandrsquos current tourism boom.However, it does include the launch of the Scottish Tourist Board in July  ndash voted fourth most signicant event for Scotlandrsquos tourism sector.And while rsquos high-profile and sometimes controversial Year of Homecoming polled % of the votes, there appears less enthusiasm for other heavily marketed lsquotheme yearsrsquo ndash such as the  Year of Creative Scotland or last yearrsquos Year of Young People.The introduction of themed years to Scotlandrsquos tourism landscape earned no votes at all.Some people taking part in the survey had their own ideas of what attracts people to Scotland.Among their suggestions was Andy Murrayrsquos Wimbledon win, the mere fact that Billy Connolly was born here, Nessie Sightings and, perhaps for the more niche tourist, ldquoHibs winning the Scottish FA Cup after  years.Meanwhile, opinions on what constitutes the most momentous event dfered across regions, with the Rough Guide status coming top among people in east central Scotland and the Highlands and Islands, while Braveheart took the honours in Aberdeen.Other key moments included the launch of the North Coast  route in  and the age of low-cost air travel, particularly the introduction of Easyjetrsquos Luton to Glasgow flights.However, it was the colourful and thrilling spectacle of the  Glasgow games which appears to have had most impact on showcasing the nation as a friendly and welcoming tourist destination.Scotland fielded its largest ever team at the  Games and won a record  medals in the process.Key moments included a rain-soaked final night of athletics which saw Usain Bolt dancing to sound of The Proclaimers and then joining fellow Jamaican runners in hats and scarfs as they celebrated their x metres relay celebrations, the Queen captured lsquophotobombingrsquo an Australian hockey players selfie, Motherwell boxing mailman Charlie Flynnrsquos biggest ever delivery ndash a gold medal ndash and a string of Scottish athleticsrsquo victories.Councillor David McDonald, Depute Leader of Glasgow City Council and Chair of Glasgow Le, said the Games had helped boost sport in the city: ldquoOur city has made some huge improvements in recent years which have created a real legacy from the Games.ldquoWersquore also set to host some spectacular events in the near future which would not have been possible had Glasgow not hosted and expertly delivered the  Commonwealth Games.Malcolm Roughead, Chief Executive of VisitScotland, said: ldquoOver the last  years there have been so many big moments for Scotlandrsquos tourism industry that it is dficult to choose just one, but the public has spoken.ldquoThe Glasgow  Commonwealth Games marked a momentous time for Scotland as we showed the world that we can host the biggest events on the planet and a global spotlight was shone on our country for visitors.ldquoAll of these moments and more have helped Scotland to become a tourism giant over five decades and while this is VisitScotlandrsquos own milestone, itrsquos very much an anniversary to be shared with our industry colleagues and partners.ldquoTodayrsquos success owes much to the vision of pioneers within this resilient and resourceful industry and our th allows us to look fondly at the past while, importantly, fixing our gaze toward the future."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie aiming to shine for the community","story":"Judges will descend on Inverurie next week to assess the town for the coveted  Beautul Scotland awards.Inverurie Environmental Improvement Group has joined many others from across the country to celebrate more than  years of community improvement.The town is looking in fine colourful fettle for the judges arriving next weekAdministered by Keep Scotland Beautul -

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports. We would encourage Prospect to revisit the offer and bring this dispute to an end.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It replaces outdated software applications or even paper-based systems and is the only product of its type available on the market.The simple and easy to use interface connects directly with employees in real time and offers the company a simple overview and analytics of the crew pool.NorthLink, has around  marine staff who, alongside the crewing department, will benefit directly from the innovation.Ankaa Ltd is a new company set up by marine specialist employment firm Clyde Marine Recruitment, which has been managing seafarers for almost four decades. NorthLink Ferries’ two freight vessels, Helliar and Hildasay, were instrumental in the product development and field testing.Ian Livingstone, managing director of Ankaa, said: “The maritime community has always been challenged with effectively managing, sharing and ensuring validity of seafarer’s data. This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations. Usually this is for the benefit of our customers. But on this occasion, we’re pleased to be doing something directly for our staff, ensuring that we keep up with technology and bring the benefits of digital services to our unique workplace.

If it doesn’t then we must ensure that the Scottish Government, on behalf of the people, has another club in its bag to influence negotiations over a Section  order.“Namely we need the prospect of a direct mandate for independence from a majority of MPs from a Westminster Electionto positively progress Scotland to the prosperity of our Nordic and Irish neighbours and away from the damaging policies of Westminster.”Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said people in Scotland were growing tired of the SNP’s predictable calls for independence, which seemingly follow every governmental and electoral development across the UK.She added: “Senior figures in the SNP are now resembling golf club bores with their relentless and predictable calls for another independence referendum.“They’re droning on repeatedly to anyone within earshot about the break-up of Britain, when most voters want Scotland to move on from constitutional mayhem.“Nicola Sturgeon should be using the arrival of a new Prime Minister as a way of helping Scotland thrive within the UK.“Instead, she’s being her opportunistic self and banging the drum for another unwanted and isive referendum.“That would only set Scotland back even further, and spoil any chance we have of boosting jobs, prosperity and public services for the future.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Oh and the vile culture that I object to is busy protesting outside Anderton School in Birmingham like you they are using children to push their agenda, while you hold the shield of “islamaphobia” over them to protect their bigotry from critique.I see the French far right nutters National Rally are boycotting Greta Thunberg now. It#s striking that right-wing extremists shake in their shoes when intelligent women come on the scene.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the . Peter Hamilton, you are priceless. Keep it up please your fountains of wisdom are priceless.Although he has disparagesthree times above, Ian references their articles when it suits, albeit selectively. For example, on July th above, he excitedly reported:“The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option#”However, had he dwelt on the full article,he would have realised the actual scientists involved perceive there is an urgent problem, that their solution is partial, that it can only really help - years down the line, and that other urgent actions are required. His position is quite far from theirs.Just in case Ian misses the point, the selective misuse of other scientist’s work isn’t what real scientists do. So “a sensible, intelligent and educated option”, for Ian, might involve a refresher course to help him avoid misassumptions and  claims. That would be a “more rational course of action” than attempting to maintain his current pretensions that nothing incan be trusted and that his unsubstantiated understanding of climate science can.Further to the above, I have never #had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg.# I merely pointed out her unfortunate mental illnesses intermated that she was, perhaps mentally exploited by her dysal family and the Greens ofEurope. No wonder she suffers from #selective mutism#, that is when her ultra-green father speaks on her behalf. To claim my motive is allied to Germany’s AfD, a neo-nazi movement is a lie and slander, no more no less, so typical of your tawdry comments.Further to the above, another little porky from Peter. Peter Hamilton claims above that,# hiscurrent pretensions that nothing incan be trusted#!! What manest nonsense, it is self-evident that is a lie. Peter highlights my comments where I quote articles from theto further my views ! It is only the arty, green and ignorant socialist prejudiced types that I disparage. They are not limited to thewe have some specials on Shetland. I sure Peter knows to whom I refer. Why is the far right intent on undermining climate concern  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg’s widely reported conversation helps to shine light on the answers.Undermining collaboration between liberal democracies, whilst simultaneously weakening trust in mainstream political solutions and structures, is of course helpful to these extremists, however this can be achieved.But there is also big money at stake in continuing our current trajectory in general, and reliance on fossil fuels in particular. Ocasio-Cortez helpfully points out that ExxonMobil had internal science that “definitively pointed out that climate change was real” in the s and back then were predicting weather changes as far ahead as . She also states the fossil fuel lobby, and particularly the Koch brothers, have “essentially purchased the entire Republican Party”. I find it to be an informative and inspiring article which should be of particular use to anyone questioning whether Greta Thunberg should have a voice in the debate. To see Ian Tinkler and John Tulloch attack her barely days apart, and in such similar terms, is troubling indeed. Be they witting or unwitting tools of a broader extremist agenda, I hope they can reflect and desist.A more thorough appreciation of how Gove formed this view with regard to the information and advice provided by Professor Ian Boyd, Defra’s Chief Scientic Adviser, and his team can be found at:Both the U.K. and the Scottish Parliaments have declared there is a climate crisis, but Ian surely knows better..."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

In the last six months, two of the Wardens have also voluntarily piloted twilight shts to enable them to attend local community meetings and events including the PCSP PSNI business crime prevention advice workshops, Dromore CPLC, etc. This has enabled the Wardens to build strong relationships with local community representatives and work with them to help resolve issues that are causing community concerns.Since the introduction of safety wardens in , the wardens have made a signicant contribution to reducing anti-social behaviour across the Banbridge District as well as providing reassurance to local communities and to those enjoying the night time social economy in Banbridge town centre.

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled.

This, she says, will leave her struggling to make ends met.Following their benefits blunder, the department now plans to take the money from Mrs McLaughlin’s existing benefits, which she depends on to survive.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs McLaughlin told how she felt like she had “committed a crime” during her PIP assessment.“When I went for the PIP assessment I went to Citizens’ Advice to help us out and a girl came along to represent me,” she said.“She was talking me through it outside because I got myself up to high doh over it.“When I went in the pressure just got the better of me. I was being asked questions and some of them I found hard to answer. I answered to the best of my knowledge, but I felt asI had committed a crime and I was in front of a  of judges.”Despite winning her appeal, she must now pay back £. per fortnight out of her already meagre benefits. As well as the impact on her mental health, Mrs McLaughlin said she will “struggle” just to make ends meet.“The only thing we had to live off was ESA, which was only £ between us,” she said.“Why are they sending us this letter a year later saying that we have to pay the money back  It came as a complete shock. I rang and explained the circumstances, but I was just told that I have to pay it back by law. I understand that they gave us the money to pull us through, but why did they leave it for a year and let it mount up  At the end of the day the fault lies with them, but we are the ones being penalised. She put me onto a debt management line and I was toldI didn’t agree to pay it then they would start taking it out of my benefits anyway because my money comes from them.“We’re trying to run a house, we have oil and food to pay for, we don’t have a car but we have buses and taxi fares to pay for too. It puts me under a lot of pressure. I was trying to work out what it’s going to cost me and it’s going to take over a year and a half to pay it. I don’t know how I’m going to afford it. I received a letter a few months ago about going back to work. I can’t start work due to my health issues, and I only have another year left on my ESA – I have to re-appeal that. I don’t knowI’m going to get it back or not, so how am I going to make these payments ”She added: “I was only starting to relax and feel a bit better lately. I’m on a lot of medication for it. This has put a lot of pressure on me. I was in a complete state over this letter, but there’s nothing I can do – they’re going to take the money anyway.”A spokesperson for the Department for Communities, said: “Welfare Supplementary Payments are available to existing Disability Living Allowance claimants who experiences a loss of benefit following a reassessment to Personal Independence Paymenthowever depending on a person’s circumstances they may be entitled to more than one type of WSP arising from loss of DLA.“Claimants who do not qualy for PIP and subsequently successfully appeal the decision receive Welfare Supplementary Payments equal to the weekly rate of their previous Disability Living Allowance payments. In the event of a successful appeal and in line with the legislation the Department carries out an adjustment on any arrears due to ensure that an overpayment does not occur hence the claimant does not lose out financially.“However, in some circumstances e.g. where a WSP is paid for loss of a Carers Premium the legislation does not provide for an offset process to allow arrears of Carers Allowance benefit to be adjusted following a successful PIP appeal. Instead all arrears of Carers Allowance must be paid to the carer and recovery of the overpayment of the WSP sought from the person who actually received it however again in these circumstance neither the claimant nor the carer has lost out financially.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cap on seats sold by belfast city airport lifted","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Belfast City Airport https:t.co LMKvhSG pic aYrsOWGkiV— Dept InfrastructureJuly , The department has signed a new Modied Planning Agreement with the airport which will control operations with immediate effect.This agreement endorses the recommendations of the Planning Appeals Commission independent report of the public inquiry.It removes the two million cap on the number of seats for sale on departing flights and also establishes a new noise management system at the airport.While the passenger number cap has been removed, the airport retains an annual limit of , on air traffic movements.The airport is acutely aware of the environment in which it works and will continue to be transparent with regard to all its operations with all its stakeholdersBelfast City AirportLast year the airport saw just over , air traffic movements.The new noise control measures include a departure noise limit on all flights with levies payable to the Community Fund when this is exceeded.Additionally, a penalty system for late flights has been introduced into the agreement with fines increased compared with the previous voluntary Flybe disruption scheme operated by the airport.It also includes the establishment of a Noise Insulation Scheme offering funding for sound insulation to residential and noise sensitive properties experiencing an average equivalent daily daytime noise level of dB.A spokesman for Belfast City Airport welcomed the removal of the cap.“The airport is acutely aware of the environment in which it works and will continue to be transparent with regard to all its operations with all its stakeholders,” he said.Local residents’ umbrella group Belfast City Airport Watch extended a cautious welcome for the new modied planning agreement.It said: “On a first reading, the document would appear to meet key recommendations made by the Planning Appeals Commission at the conclusion of the public inquiry on this matter.“However, the new agreement contains considerable technical detail and we want to study this in more detail before giving a more considered response.“Moreover, since the commission published its report, the World Health Organisationhas issued new guidance on aviation noise and we’d already urged the Department for Infrastructure to take that WHO guidance on board in this new agreement.“The department doesn’t appear to have done that and we’ll certainly continue pressing the department to implement the WHO guidance which was drawn up on the basis of an extensive body of evidence.”"},{"url":null,"title":"julian smith named new northern ireland secretary","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said: “We will be seeking a meeting with him at the earliest opportunity to impress upon him the importance of the £. billion per annum hospitality sector in Northern Ireland and its central role in the economy here.“He needs to understand right from the start that we must not leave the EU without a deal the restoration of the Assembly and Executive is

important role to play in the ongoing talks process and must approach it in an impartial, focused way to help break the deadlock.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland council refuses to spend 500

It was agreed, as per Sinn Feins Notice of Motion, that ABC Council officers would explore the possibility of the local authority being represented at the August parade.However, at Mondays council meeting it was decided that a delegation would not attend the annual event.The DUP group leader on ABC Council, councillor Mark Baxter, said that his party objected to both motions and added that there was \"low interest\" in anyone attending the Pride parade.\"Based on the low interest across the chamber, with only four out of  councillors expressing any interest in attending, this was not seen as value for money,\" Mr Baxter added. \"With the distinct lack of interest from the very councillors who proposed the motion, a decision was taken that ABC Council does not formally attend the event.\"However, Sinn Fein councillor Paul Duffy, who proposed last months motion, said he would still attend the event and was very disappointed that the council would not be sending a delegation.\"Im deeply disappointed, not just for myself but for the whole community,\" added the Portadown councillor. \"The response Im getting from Protestants, Catholics and others has blown me away.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

led the opening day parade for the Foyle Cup on Monday, a week-long international tournament with more than , players, coaches, match officials and supporters.Founded four years ago by Kevin Morrison, whose son Adam, , has Down’s Syndrome, Oxford Bulls rose to acclaim after a video of the team playing against Stoke City winger James McClean went viral.Mr Morrison says the club has been on an uphill trajectory ever since, and the boys are now “mini celebrities” both home and abroad.They led the parade on the opening day, and they were absolutely phenomenal, everyone knows them now.Kevin Morrison“Around two years ago we were trying to organise matches, instead of having the boys training all the time, but we couldn’t find any teams who would play us,” Mr Morrison said.“James contacted me and said he would come down to play, and that day I posted the video, it took off from there, we’ve been in all the newspapers, the BBC, we were on TV for ABC in America, it just took off from there.“They’re like mini celebrities now, this is our third Foyle Cup, we play in the disability section and we have four teams now.“They led the parade on the opening day, and they were absolutely phenomenal, everyone knows them now.“We play all our matches in one day, and we got our trophy on Tuesday, so the boys are delighted.“We hope to double the number of teams we field, and have eight next year, but it’s not that straightforward as it’s hard to get teams of similar abilities because we have so many disabilities within our team.“We took them to Liverpool last year and played two matches with Down’s Syndrome teams, but we couldn’t find anyone of our own age, so we had them playing against teenagers and lads in their s, but we were so proud of them, the opposing team were twice their size and probably going for pints with their dads after.”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Oxford Bulls football team are taking part in the Foyle Cup two years after they became a viral sensation playing against Republic of Ireland star James McClean .Entirely volunteer-run, health and safety is the priority for Bulls coaching staff, and coaching is almost entirely on a one-to-one basis.“Impulse control is important for children with Down’s Syndrome, so we need to keep numbers tight to coaches, it takes patience, but the pay-off is worth it.“We have people contacting us from all around the world saying the boys are an inspiration, and they’re looking to set up their own team in their own countries.“We just want people to know that this is not the old stereotypical kids with Down’s Syndrome.“We played against Celtic legends recently, Rab Douglas was the keeper, a former Celtic keeper, and one of our boys chipped the ball over his head.“It has a quarter of a million views on YouTube, it’s gone crazy, our kids can do these things, it just takes a bit longer to coach them, and they get a lot out of it, it’s ability not disability.“My own son hated loud noises, crowds and was really shy, we’re four years in now, he’s leading a parade, standing on a stage, and asking me about football scores like any wee boy would do with their dad.“When we first started, we had  players, it took the first six months to teach them to shoot in the other direction from the other team, but that’s what it’s all about.“They’re mini celebrities now, but eventually we won’t be seen as something dferent, and that’s what we want.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say july","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.

Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has always had an interest in writing - right from his days at the University of Ulster, Coleraine, where he studied History and English.Even back then - some  years ago - he was jotting down ideas for stories from his rich creative mind.Over the past several years his hobby has stepped up a gear, thanks to a blog he has been writing - A Fractured Faith. There he and his we Fionnuala and his daughter Rebecca have been giving flight to their creative writing and commentary pieces.Stephen, who works as a civil servant, explained: “This is my first novel. About three years ago the name Kirkwood Scott popped into my head.Stephen and Fionnuala Black.“He’s very loosely based on my le in Belfast in my s. Kirkwood is a bit of a loser really, a university graduate in a dead end job who’s just been dumped by his girlfriend. He is still coming to terms with the murder of his father, a police officer, when he was younger.“Kirkwood suffers from OCD and it manests itself in a number of routines he has to carry out,he doesn’t terrible things will happen. “He has a voice in his head and he has given it a name - Augustus Skelly, the colonel of the toy soldiers he played with as a child.“An ancient evil is uncovered on the streets of Belfast and is about to emerge. “Skelly is the manestation of that evil and only Kirkwood and two of his friends- Harley and Meredith - have the power to stop it.”Kirkwood has long believed the voice in his head has simply been a figment of his imagination until he encounters a homeless woman on the streetwho is drawing a picture of Skelly in a notebook. It’s only when Kirkwood, Harley and Meredith come together that they can defeat this evil force.Musical homecoming for Cain is ‘special’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The fantasy novel has supernatural and paranormal elements but also tackles more earthly issues such as mental health, homelessness, disability and addiction.While none of the characters in the book are based on real people, Stephen has taken some turns of phrase from people he has met and the character of Harley was inspired by his daughter Hannah. Harley was disabled as the result of a road traffic accident - Stephen’s daughter has spina bida and hydrocephalus.On the subject of getting his work published Stephen said: “I had to send out a pitch to agents and publishers. “I went for it and pitched to New York and London agents and got some good feedback. “That encouraged me and I tried other publishers, “I had my fair share of rejections but in the space of a week two small publishers accepted me. “Writing a book is the easy bit, getting published is the hard part.”Stephen’s book is available online and in print through Amazon, on the Fractured Faith blog or directly from the author.About FracturedfaithblogStephen Black’s blog - FracturedFaithblog - has developed quite an online presence with , followers on Wordpress,It covers a wide range of subjects but is essentially a showcase for Stephen’s writing.However, his we Fionnuala has also produced a series of articles for the blog.Stephen is a keen runner and that also features on his blog.He explained: “I write about my running a lot but it can be a hotch potch to showcase my writing.“I can be walking down the street and see something which gives me an idea for a story.“My we Fionnuala has encouraged me to do this. She’s the power behind the throne. She keeps me on the straight and narrow.”On the blog they state: “Hi. We are Stephen  Fionnuala Black. We are a Christian couple who live in rural Northern Ireland with our three children, Adam, Hannah and Rebecca. Oh and not forgetting Charlie the border terrier. We have been together for  years and married for . It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster ride and we hope this blog will offer comfort to others who are going through similar experiences.

They too pay rates. The fact unionist Cllrs came together to vote this proposal down is depressing.”Alliance councillor Eóin Tennyson has said ‘you cannot put a price on equality and acceptance’. “This would have been a small, but incredibly signicant gesture of support for the LGBTQ+ community in our borough but particularly for LGBT members of staff within the Council. It is particularly disappointing that the Ulster Unionists chose to vote this way, despite their leader Robin Swann stating just last month that their party would not stand for intolerance,” he added.SDLP Cllr Joe Nelson said: “It is another step to Ballygobackwards. This issue transcends our political isions and it is a slap in the face for those LGBTQ people either nationalist or unionist.”DUP Group Leader on council Mark Baxter said: “The original motion was debated and despite our objections to lighting of the buildings and flying of the flag, the motion received a majority in the council chamber. The part of the motion referring to the Council being represented at the parade was for exploration by officials with a report brought back to Monday evening’s full council meeting. Based on the low interest across the chamber with only four out of  Councillors expressing any interest in attending, this was not seen as value for money.”Mark BaxterUlster Unionist Cllr Louise McKinstry said: “The motion passed in the June meeting has not been overthrown. The motion has and will be carried out to the letter. The possibility of attending was explored and there seemed no appetite to attend as a corporate body. The civic building will still light up in rainbow colours and the flag will fly on the designated day.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

John Healy, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said “we should be heartened by the fact that our politicians are apparently talking” but after two years without movement of any kind “we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry”. “Nevertheless, they mustn’t waste time. So much is at stakethey don’t want history to look back on this period and say – they promised so much but delivered so little. \"My advice would be: Don’t give up. Don’t let a dficulty today ruin the vision for tomorrow.

Mr Healy, who heads up Allstate in Northern Ireland, also said thata fresh bid to host the World Chambers Congress is successful, it could be worth around £m to the Northern Ireland economy. “We need action on the economy, on infrastructure, on health – addressing the drastic shortage of clinical nurses, for example – or on education,” he said. “The drt of our talented students to universities across the water or how we face issues like numeracy and literacy levels. “However, we should be heartened by the fact that our politicians are now talking. That’s a welcome step forward.
