Part instruction manual, part howl of rage, Equal tells a personal story that changed the public debate.Nearly 50 years after equal pay was first enshrined in UK law, there are still too many instances where women are paid less, not just when they work flexibly or in lower paid jobs but when they do the same job. The fact that this illegal behaviour takes place at the BBC, where Gracie had worked successfully for 30 years, fuels a sense of fury.Having made equal pay a requirement of her posting as China editor to Beijing, she finds out just how much more the BBC pays Jon Sopel, the North American editor in July 2017, when the corporation is forced to reveal by the Royal Charter the employees paid more than £150,000. Sopel is paid between £230,000 and £239,000 Gracie isn’t even on the list.Her shock at the behaviour of the BBC, an organisation she obviously cherishes, gives her story the feel of a personal betrayal but, as she points out, if a great organisation can do this to her – an award-winning, Oxbridge-educated, well-paid white woman – what about everybody else?Pay is complex, but the BBC does not cover itself in glory in this saga. Gracie’s “long and careful emails” go unheeded, her hours and profile are questioned and she says the experience was worse than her treatment for cancer.At times the situation becomes Kafkaesque. Gracie is told she cannot record a grievance hearing and is then locked in a series of frustrating, debilitating battles over what was actually said. “How can I trust you?” she says of an organisation which needs more than ever to be trusted. At one point, the BBC HR department blames the fact Gracie was in “growth and development” for the pay discrepancy. “Like Ginger Rogers, I did everything the North America editor did except backwards and in high heels – in this case not literally but in Mandarin and with a police state at my back.”I played a small and unwitting role in this battle on the day Gracie went public, when members of the supportive network of BBC Women such as Jane Garvey were not allowed to interview her and so I was called to do so instead.There are typically more men called John in senior positions at the BBC than women and two in particular – John Humphrys and Jon Sopel – are criticised in this book. But there are moments of warmth and humour as well as rage. When a senior executive asks to come to her house, Gracie flies into a panic, rushing to hide the washing-up – and her son. “Imagine the home of a single parent locked in a long battle with her employer and suffering depression as a result. That’s what my house looked like,” she writes.The BBC finally agree to pay Gracie £361,000 in back pay, a sum she donates to the Fawcett Society to set up an equal pay advice service. The fact that she wrote this book in six months of unpaid leave confirms that this is not about her getting more money, but about making the entire system fair and transparent.The book is full of advice for others – there is a separate section at the end for employers, men and women. And there are signs of change. On the day Gracie goes public with her fight, she is presenting the Today programme, which discusses the #MeToo movement in Hollywood and gender balance in parliament. “Almost every story resonated with mine,” she realises. Now back in her old job presenting on BBC News, her decision to use her personal story for the public good has put the issue of equal pay firmly on the agenda. Her final piece of advice? “Like talking about other delicate subjects, like sex or death, it gets easier the more you try.”• Equal is published by Virago (£18.99).

Private schools are out of reach (average fees nearly £18,000 a year) for the great majority of people their spend per pupil is at least three times more than that of state schools – a grotesque resources gap and they constitute a highly effective service industry, which not only almost guarantees places at top universities but also provides a network of invaluable connections – together a passport to life’s glittering prizes, with two old Etonian PMs in the last three years the most visible symbol. They are indeed enablers of wealth hoarding, of power hoarding, of opportunity hoarding. They are, in short, an affront to any notion of a just or inclusive society.Such was the case put forward in our book Engines of Privilege, published in February, a work in many ways born out of long years of frustration at the prevailing political inertness on the issue. We had no expectation that seven months later the Labour party would vote at its conference to integrate the private sector into the state sector. In criticising Labour’s position, the headmaster of Eton, Simon Henderson, this week acknowledged the public mood was shifting on the question, and that a battle lay ahead for the future of private education.It is a good moment, with the issue suddenly near the top of the non-Brexit agenda, to ask why over the last three-quarters of a century we have made so little progress in tackling what is, in many ways, a very British problem – given that in no other western society are private schools so deeply entrenched or so corrosive in their effects. There have been three potential turning points, but all failed to deliver change: the Tory education minister Rab Butler deftly ensured during the war that the private school issue was excluded from the otherwise historic 1944 Education Act. After the second world war, any reforming zeal on Clement Attlee’s part was emasculated by his umbilical attachment to his old school, Haileybury. And during the 1960s, Harold Wilson’s Labour government initiated a royal commission on the public schools (as they were still absurdly called), whose mouse of a report in July 1968 achieved precisely nothing. The report did, however, prompt a flurry of letters to the . On 25 July, the letters page featured a pocket cartoon by the paper’s brilliant resident cartoonist, Abu. It showed a rather cross-looking man scribbling a letter – “Sir, with reference to your leader on the public school system’s isive influence on our society …” – and above him a calendar. The date was 25 July 2068.It is now nearer to 2068 than 1968, and nothing of real substance has been achieved. But after four decades of virtual permafrost, things are hotting up again. Books (including Melissa Benn’s Life Lessons and Robert Verkaik’s Posh Boys, as well as our own) are starting to confront the issue. Private School Policy Reform (PSPR, of which we are among the founders) is a newly established and politically independent website-cum-thinktank. Labour Against Private Schools (LAPS) is a new and energetic pressure group. And, of course, Labour itself has now voted in favour of radical change. Yet whatever happens politically this autumn and beyond, we as a society are unlikely to make any serious progress on the issue unless we understand why we have so comprehensively failed to do so in the past.There is also what we call the “different planet” problem. In London and the south-east, as well as in such affluent cities as Edinburgh, Oxford and York, private schools may be thick on the ground and the subject of endless fraught conversations. Elsewhere, in large parts of Britain, they are rarer and do not impinge on most people’s daily lives or consciousness. Physical location, similarly, matters in the sense that many of the leading private schools, especially boarding schools, are tucked away in the countryside or semi-countryside – out of sight, out of mind.Also unhelpful has been what seems to be an intense reluctance on the part of the vast majority of state school leaders to put their heads above the parapet and speak out on the private school issue. During our public encounters with private school heads after the publication of Engines of Privilege, nothing has been more irritating than their line of: “We don’t hear the state schools complaining about us. What they complain about is the lack of funding from government.” Admittedly, it has been a state school teacher, Holly Rigby, one of the driving forces behind LAPS, who has pointed out the demotivating effects of private school privilege. But on the whole the private school leaders are correct: their state school counterparts remain the dog that fails to bark. Is this because they don’t want to be seen as overly political? Because to privilege the private school issue might somehow be viewed as denigrating the state school system? Or, perhaps most likely, because they have a large amount on their plate and just want to get on with it, without casting unproductively envious eyes elsewhere? Yet because of the yawning resources gap they are in effect operating with one hand tied behind their backs, not helped by the debilitating flow of state-trained teachers from state schools into private schools. This is especially the case given the very effective PR machine that the private sector has at its disposal. The wider economic benefits conferred, all the wonderful partnerships with state schools, the many bursaries open to poor children, the sanctity of parental choice, the irretrievable damage that any reform would do to “the fabric of education in this country” – the daily drumbeat continues from the Independent Schools Council and other seldom accountable industry bodies, complete with a sophisticated and shameless line in “the problem lies elsewhere”, as we have found in our public encounters. And since Sunday’s vote at the Labour conference, the drumbeat has turned into a frenzy, accompanied by a palpable closing of the ranks on the part of powerful allies.Yet in some of our private meetings with private school leaders since our book was published, we have found them surprisingly willing to move away from a stubbornly defensive mode and to discuss constructively how the sector can actually do what it claims it wants to do, namely to transform the composition of their schools away from social exclusivity and towards social ersity. Have the schools got the financial resources to do this, through a vastly expanded bursaries programme, off their own bat? Or would such a scheme have to rely on state-funded places? And would this involve the state determining who gets the places and a lessening of independent governance? On all this they are more open-minded than we had expected – even if they have not yet fully confronted all the issues that would arise. Though on the essential moral question of whether in a good society it is right for parents to pay vast sums for education and thereby buy positional advantage for their children, we could detect little or no movement.What about the politicians? From Margaret Thatcher onwards, the pursuit of greater equality of opportunity (as opposed to equality of outcome) has been proclaimed as lying somewhere near the very heart of the Tory creed. Yet with painfully few exceptions, notably the odd fluttering from Michael Gove, politicians of the right have stubbornly refused to face the stark incompatibility between equality of opportunity and a flourishing fee-paying sector. When this summer we asked a sympathetic Tory backbencher if she could recommend a similarly sympathetic colleague for us to talk to, she could only name one. “They all educate their children privately” and “they don’t actually care about equality of opportunity” are the two most commonly wielded explanations whenever we’ve discussed this with others. But perhaps one day those politicians will take the issue seriously, and at last grapple with the competing demands of liberty and equity.The greater responsibility, given their larger commitment to the values of fairness and inclusivity, lies with Labour politicians. “That’s a hard one you’ve taken on there,” Gordon Brown wryly remarked to us in 2014 – testimony to the fatalism about the private school issue that had gripped his party even before the coming of New Labour. Too complicated, too invidious, too emotive, altogether too hot to handle. Such, despite the simplicity of the fundamental argument about unfairness, were the default assumptions for all those years, and which are only now starting to change. There persists a great vulnerability, namely the exposure to the charge of hypocrisy against any Labour politician who has been privately educated or, still worse, chosen as a parent to go private. In our view, such politicians, whose general dislike of private education is at odds with their own decision as parents, should be exempt from accusations of hypocrisy unless (which is clearly not the case yet) they are actively imposing denial of choice on parents generally. This is a difficult area, with no clear-cut right or wrong. It has hobbled the left over the issue, with Boris Johnson’s gleefully reported charge on Monday of “unbelievable hypocrisy” merely an opening salvo.Which brings us finally to left-leaning readers and voters. Some, like us, will have been privately educated and are uneasily aware of the advantages we came to enjoy as a result. Others have been, or are, parents of children who attend private school, and are in all likelihood even more uneasily aware of the gap between values and practice. Yet we all have to live in the world as it is, not as we might wish it to be, and parents will always do what they see as best for their children. But rather than pretend the issue does not exist, however tempting that might be, it would be far better for such parents to support a change to the existing dispensation and a move towards ending – whether abruptly or incrementally is an important but second-order question – our horrible and infinitely damaging educational apartheid.A mature democracy should be capable of discussing the private school issue in a calm and considered way that transcends personal circumstances. The debate, in short, badly needs to up its game. We have at No 10 an over-entitled PM but proper entitlement would be to give all of our children, from whatever background, a fair deal.• Engines of Privilege: Britain’s Private School Problem by Francis Green and David Kynaston is published by Bloomsbury (£9.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various iniduals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?Now I want to know too.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Ryanair had ordered up to 135 of the aircraft for its expansion plans, with the first planes due this year. The model remains grounded, however, since the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.The memo came a week after UK pilots called off the remainder of a series of strikes this month. The pilots union, Balpa, had complained about Ryanair’s “abysmal approach to industrial relations” and said the dispute over pay and conditions was driven by resentment over a range of cost-saving measures used by Ryanair.Ryanair had called the strikes pointless and managed to operate the majority of its UK schedules by bringing in more contractors and pilots from overseas bases. The airline had warned of winter base closures across Europe.Last week, the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, was awarded a new pay package in which he could receive a €99m (£88m) bonus within five years, although almost half of Ryanair shareholders voted against it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68b0a3dabaec0ee749b95d5662e3b7a11281d76/333_0_3086_1852/master/3086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd48958db8e0a31f82c3053656264150","title":"thomas cook directors could have bonuses seized suggests shapps","story":"Transport secretary outlines available options for penalising bosses of collapsed travel firmThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has suggested that Thomas Cook directors could have some of their bonuses seized or be disqualified from serving as directors after the tour operator’s implosion.Speaking in the House of Commons, Shapps outlined options for penalising directors available to the official receiver, a government employee overseeing Thomas Cook’s liquidation. He said the official receiver could “seek to overturn a range of transactions made prior to the liquidation, which includes things like bonuses”. “There is also the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, and I fully support that idea,” he said. The act outlines circumstances in which directors can be barred from City jobs.The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, pointed to £4.6m in “undeserved and unwarranted” bonuses awarded to the company’s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, which he said should be returned. However, the vast majority of the £4.6m in bonuses paid to Fankhauser was given to him in shares, which the  understands he did not sell and are now worthless.In practice, it is likely to be difficult for the receiver to seize bonuses or for directors to be barred from holding similar positions in future, despite a collapse that cost 9,000 UK staff their jobs and left 150,000 passengers stranded overseas.Thomas Cook’s legal contract with directors, detailed in its annual report, allows clawback of bonuses in a narrow set of circumstances such as misstatement of finances or gross misconduct. It is also rare that executives are stripped of their right to hold directorships. The legislation has not been used in other high-profile insolvencies that cost the taxpayer, such as the collapse of the outsourcing  company Carillion.MPs lined up to criticise the government for failing to heed its own review into airline insolvencies, which was commissioned by the former transport secretary Chris Grayling, who promised to act swiftly on it.The review called for a mechanism to allow airlines to keep flying temporarily during a bankruptcy, sparing the government from having to fund the repatriation of passengers, an operation expected to cost more than £100m in the case of Thomas Cook.Shapps said he hoped to start work on changing the airline insolvency regime soon.As MPs debated the 178-year-old tour operator’s failure, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was due to operate more than 70 flights on Wednesday to bring a further 16,500 people back to the UK. After those flights, almost a third of the 150,000 people stuck overseas will have been repatriated. More than 1,000 flights are due to operate until 6 October.Shapps said he believed the CAA had resolved all instances of holidaymakers who had been “held to ransom” for hotel bills, with a party in Cuba now having been flown home. He also pledged not to ignore Thomas Cook staff who were stranded abroad, saying he had “asked the CAA to be as flexible as possible”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/699a22a947e9a9b6420820a096647eec32b31272/0_7_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a52211aa94b1050873a69e6333ebf5","title":"trudeaus poorest constituents pushed out by montreal building project","story":"Residents of city’s Parc-Ex district, one of Canada’s poorest areas, say a new university campus is driving them out – and claim Justin Trudeau doesn’t careDespite being located in the centre of bustling Montreal, Parc-Ex feels isolated and is physically closed off from the rest of the city by borders on all sides. There’s a highway to the north, a large park to the east, train tracks to the south and a fence to the west, built by a posher neighbouring borough.This month, however, Parc-Ex is being plugged back into the heart of the city in a project that some are hailing as transformative but othersfear will gentrify the district beyond recognition, pushing out current residents.The project, dubbed Mil, is a C$348m (£210m) development by the University of Montreal which will transform a 38 hectare site that was formerly old rail yard into a vast new campus. Mil stands for Montreal Innovation Laboratory, but also plays on the word milieu (middle), a nod to its city centre location.The first stage of the development is now open: a new complex for the university’s science department, which hosts a daily influx of 2,200 students, faculty and staff. The next stage of development will include condominiums, office buildings and public spaces.Beyond the rare opportunity for a city to develop 53 football pitches’ worth of prime real estate, Mil is intended to bolster Montreal’s reputation as a hub for AI research. The new campus will be located close to the university’s AI research centre, Mila, in the nearby industrial Marconi-Alexandra area. The hope is that Parc-Ex will become the next Mile End, a Montreal neighbourhood transformed by the arrival of game giant Ubisoft.The government is investing C$84m into the Mil project, and Trudeau has promoted the plan as a way of boosting Montreal’s intellectual capital as a cornerstone of economic growth.In turn, the university is portraying Mil as a lifeline for Parc-Ex. The development will see the district connected to the well-off, mostly Francophone, borough of Outremont via a pedestrian bridge over the tracks.“We believe that opening up neighbourhoods and sectors contributes to improving people’s quality of life,” says university spokesperson Geneviève O’Meara.But as the campus opens, Parc-Ex residents are grappling with the consequences of their neighbourhood’s newfound attractiveness. New condo developments are multiplying near the subway station, and homeowners report being pressured into selling their properties by developers. In recent months, the community group Comité d’Action de Parc-Extension (Cape) has documented a spike in evictions and unlawful rent increases.To make matters worse, Montreal is in the midst of a housing crunch, and vacancy rates in Parc-Ex are at an all-time low, leaving displaced residents scrambling to find affordable housing.One resident of Parc-Ex who was evicted earlier this year found herself in a frantic search for new housing for her two sons, one of whom has a disability and attends a special school. “It was just a horrible, horrible experience being in this mad rush of people just panicking and trying to get a place,” she says. Eventually she found an apartment. It costs C$400 (£242) more per month than her previous residence, and is roughly half the size.“I just became desperate,” she says of her decision to accept the new, worse reality. “I was so afraid of becoming homeless.”Until now, Parc-Ex has remained mostly immune to the gentrification forces that have filled Montreal with hip coffee shops, cocktail bars and yoga studios. It is a lively, unassuming neighbourhood, with tree-lined residential streets filled with low-rise apartments, shops catering to multiple ethnic groups, and numerous places of worship. “Parc-Ex was sort of an anomaly,” says Rachel Shugart, a Parc-Ex resident and former program director of the Welcome Collective, a nonprofit group that helps refugee claimants through their first few months in Montreal.“The apartments that are available for the poorest, most vulnerable families are only low-price, despite their central position, despite their walkability, because the buildings are in such bad shape. They’re really terrible apartments, and nobody else would take them if they had any other options.”But while Montreal had until now avoided the worst of the housing inflation that has seized other large Canadian cities, thanks in part to generous tenant laws that cap rent increases and restrict evictions, times are changing. Property prices are rising, putting additional pressure on Parc-Ex.“The real estate market has been gaining momentum for a dozen years, but in the past two years, it’s been disproportionate,” says Faiz Abhuani. Abuhani runs Brick by Brick, which raises community bonds to purchase properties and turn them into affordable housing in Parc-Ex. The spike in prices, he says, has dashed his hopes of making deals any time soon.Now, the Mil project is bringing that pressure directly into the heart of Parc-Ex.There are no official statistics on rent increases or evictions, but Cape says it helped close to 500 tenants in the first half of 2019. Of those, 21 were being pushed out illegally and 16 had been pressured to leave. Since last year there has been “a significant increase in the number of people coming to see us for questions relating to rent increases, repossessions, and major renovations,” says Cape’s Amy Darwish. The tension is also being ratcheted up by Montreal’s long-time effort to create jobs and raise the tax base by attracting the tech, creative and knowledge industries. Mile End quickly gentrified after Ubisoft moved in, aided by tax credits. As Mil opens there is also a push to attract AI companies to the Marconi-Alexandra area where the University of Montreal’s Mila research centre is located, as well as companies such as Element AI in September Microsoft will move into a new research lab a short walk away from Mil.Mil itself represents a “quick fix” for the city to raise revenue, says Norma Rantisi, professor in the geography, planning and environment department at Montreal’s Concordia University.“What this Montreal campus represents is a heavily publicly subsidised institution that’s serving the commercialisation of knowledge in ways that are supporting private sector endeavours,” she says, “but at the same time putting at risk a lot of the lower-income residents and lower-income establishments.”Critics say the university should be paying more attention to its immediate impact on the neighbourhoods where it is located.Research has shown that large institutions can leverage their economic power to spur inclusive growth in surrounding communities. The University of Toronto has launched an Anchor Strategy for its campus in Scarborough, one of Canada’s most multicultural areas, which includes reforming its procurement process to bring in more erse and local enterprises on campus, and increasing employment and training opportunities for nearby residents. Drexel University in Philadelphia, US, found that its Hire Local initiative led to decreased turnover rates among staff.By contrast, O’Meara says the University of Montreal hiring process is regulated by collective agreements that prevent it from setting jobs aside for workers from specific parts of the city.But none of the housing is reserved for current Parc-Ex residents, and it is unclear when any of it will be built the roughly 1,000 households in Parc-Ex on a waiting list for social housing will not get first rights on the new Mil units.“The arrival of the University of Montreal has created havoc,” says one resident who has lived in Parc-Ex for 28 years. “Most people here are immigrants, they earn the minimum wage, some are on welfare. If the University of Montreal brings improvements, they won’t benefit those people. We’ve seen it happen in other neighbourhoods.”Concerns about the project’s ability to integrate seamlessly with surrounding neighbourhoods were voiced early on. The former dean of the architecture school, Jean-Claude Marsan, argued for the university to densify its existing campus rather than build a second one, out of fears the new campus wouldn’t be economically viable. In 2006 Montreal’s other French-speaking university, UQAM, barely escaped bankruptcy when funds for its own new science campus and student housing project were mismanaged.Undeterred, the University of Montreal launched a vast public consultation of residents and community actors. That process and statements from university representatives led the community to believe that decisions would be made transparently, says Gonzalo Lizarralde, a professor in the university’s architecture school, but in the end most decisions were made behind closed doors, he says.“A lot of expectations were created, for instance on the integration of the two neighbourhoods, on the revitalisation of Parc-Extension, on the improvements for residents. A lot of expectations were created, and were not met,” he says. “Because in the end Parc-Ex got a footbridge, but there hasn’t been any large impact so far.”“This is Justin Trudeau’s riding,” says the Parc-Ex resident who was evicted earlier this year. “And he’s going on talking about all the importance of social justice and housing and talking a good game. But he knew, there’s no way he didn’t. They knew that campus was coming, 10 years ago.” Her new landlord is under pressure to sell the building, and she fears she will have to leave again soon.She adds: “Those of us with disabilities to deal with, or discrimination that we’re facing, we’re having a hard time, working hard, struggling, and pushing everyone else down to join the middle class … Well, he doesn’t give a shit about us.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a3e18888f1d750765def6cdcb1c38d250037f1a/0_129_3251_1950/master/3251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1454b6cfe11a5e8069e424d287a4dfc4","title":"the guardian view on brexit politics arsenic in the water supply","story":"Britain is five weeks away from the ruinous and dangerous position of leaving the European Union without a deal. There is no sign of the country having made any progress towards getting one. Boris Johnson did not meet the 30-day deadline set by Angela Merkel to come up with an alternative solution to replace the Irish backstop to resolve the Brexit impasse with the European Union. This week he suffered a devastating judicial blow in the supreme court over an attempt to suspend parliament for an unprecedented five weeks at a time of political crisis to evade scrutiny. In a worrying sign of how far the Tory party has embraced radical populism, its MPs responded by calling for the court to be abolished. And instead of remorse Mr Johnson offered offence in parliament, couching his bluster in the jingoistic terms of “betrayal”, “surrender” and “sabotage”. Mr Johnson touched a new low by besmirching the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox.Mr Johnson, like his predecessor Theresa May, describes Brexit as the will of the British people. It isn’t – not least because there was no shared vision as to what “leave” actually meant – but the language is designed to remove dissent, and any acknowledgment of erse voices and views. The contraction of Brexit and the national interest has curdled and soured British politics. While the result deserves respect, almost half the country opposed it. During the referendum campaign Mr Johnson, a prominent leaver, did not engage in a deliberative, honest and respectful argument with opponents – a historic failure in light of the gravity of the decision. In office he has continued to offer insouciance and belligerence.In his book Beyond Brexit, Vernon Bogdanor warns that in leaving the EU, Britain could again become a country with no legal remedy for breaches of human rights. At present, when courts make a declaration of incompatibility between convention rights and British law, ministers act to put things right. That might not be the case in the years ahead. We could become a “paradise for an overweening executive”. Brexit populism is pouring arsenic into the water supply of our national conversation. Brexit raised questions that it cannot answer because it identified problems that politicians did not recognise and were unprepared to solve. They should start. Only dullness in parliamentary government can heal the isions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c32d42a4baa7ba37108c886a783a87d433004870/0_0_5193_3116/master/5193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=011a47c9e0b67f44e96858eb3f1a251e","title":"labour activists radical agenda corbynism","story":"The party’s battles over Brexit have drowned out the transformative policies that its members pushed through conferenceLabour’s conference began as farce, but culminated in a triumphant affirmation of the most radical incarnation of Corbynism yet. The abortive attempt to remove the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, enraged Jeremy Corbyn so much he broke with his near-cardinal aversion to swearing, and threatened to destabilise Labour’s last major pre-election opportunity to showcase its radical vision. The supreme court’s damning ruling against the prime minister reinvigorated morale and offered a necessary reminder of the frightening political stakes at hand, but it was a democratic insurgency at the conference – although sometimes colliding with old-style machine politics – that re-energised a Labour grassroots preparing to march into an existential political battle.The promise of Corbynism was of a member-led, democratised party and while this commitment has much to recommend it, it has always had limits. For example, the party leadership and major unions have resisted moves towards a key membership demand – open selection for MPs – because this would require MPs to automatically stand in a contest with other candidates if they wish to be reselected. As a result, not a single MP has been deselected, leaving the politics of most of the parliamentary party at odds with the membership. Cynical manoeuvres reminiscent of the New Labour era have sometimes been deployed too: for example, the leadership successfully forced free movement off the agenda at the last two conferences, fearing the potential unpopularity of such a commitment. For those who fear the Labour machine can capture even the most radical of leaders, the latter is the most striking example. Labour members elected its most pro-migrant leader ever, who celebrated his first leadership triumph by speaking at a refugees’ rights protest – and yet the party has shown a depressing failure to make the case for freedom of movement since.The tussle over Brexit also exposes the limits of the party’s venerated democratic culture. When the party’s national executive committee hammered out a statement committing to a referendum with remain on the ballot – as People’s Vote campaigners have noisily demanded – but with Labour taking a neutral stance, there was no proper discussion. Instead, its members were asked to vote on it by email. A conference vote on whether to back remain was treated as a loyalty test – with the Momentum leader, Jon Lansman, telling members to vote with their hearts – although hysterical claims that tactics reminiscent of China’s totalitarian regime were used were wildly off the mark: as one pro-remain campaigner told me, it’s hardly surprising that after four years of Corbyn’s leadership most elected local delegates will be passionately loyalist. “We did remarkably well, considering,” he says.But it is the democratic uprising on policy that reminded members why they have invested so much of their lives into what can broadly be called the Corbyn project. It is unlikely that commitments such as net zero emissions by 2030, support for freedom of movement – which did get a hearing this time – and the closure of all detention centres would have been offered by the leadership. These are demands that emerged from the membership. What always enthused those most committed to the project is that rather than policies simply cooked up by unelected advisers and thinktank wonks, the wisdom and imagination of members would be trusted instead. That process can be fraught. The compositing process (which hammers out the wording of policies put to conference) for the Green New Deal sometimes descended into rancour. Some trade union officials tried to dilute the motion, and an angry exchange was provoked when one climate activist showed a lack of empathy for unions wanting to protect their members’ jobs. But a democracy that is not messy is not truly a democracy at all.That the Brexit culture war has drowned out Labour’s transformative agenda – and crowded out a narrative of the many versus the few in favour of remain versus leave – has certainly depressed the party’s grassroots. But the reason delegates left the conference far more enthused than when they arrived is because, rather than being bogged down in discussions over customs unions and access to the single market, they were debating issues that had drawn them to politics in the first place: austerity, housing, workers’ rights, poverty, the climate emergency. Corbyn’s own truncated leader’s speech received rapturous applause precisely because it recaptured the magic of 2017, promising to end a four-decade-old free market consensus, with policies from taxing the rich to public ownership.Both the Tories and Lib Dems hope that an election framed entirely around Brexit will starve Labour’s domestic agenda of oxygen. If Labour can force a hearing for a radical agenda crafted in part by its own membership, however, triumph is possible. A four-year attempt to decisively break Labour from the UK’s failed neoliberal consensus has been turbulent, painful and sometimes chaotic. A new society has already been born in the imaginations of Labour’s activist base. And some who have waited a generation or more dare to dream it is finally within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ae3adf1282585adad0408d614886fc015f079d7/0_387_6608_3965/master/6608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a55ebddc798708211f8fa5144b5754b3","title":"why frequent flyers should be sent into exile","story":"It is a reminder of the eternal truth that in most areas of life it is a particularly poisonous – almost literally in this case – few that ruin things for the rest of us.

Teachers were most likely to have taken on tutoring after direct contact from parents, it says.“The government should look at introducing a means-tested voucher scheme to enable lower-income families to provide tuition for their children. Schools should also consider the implications of teachers offering paid tuition outside of lessons and how this is promoted in school.”The charity said research showed one-to-one and small-group tuition is a cost-effective way to bolster pupils’ achievement. It recommended that schools consider using their pupil premium funding – extra money given to schools for the poorest pupils – to prioritise these methods.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “We have invested an extra £2.4bn this year alone through the pupil premium and schools have flexibility over how they use this funding, which can include providing one-to-one or small-group tuition to ensure disadvantaged pupils get the extra support they need.“While we believe families should not have to pay for private tuition – and with standards rising in schools we believe in most cases private tuition to be unnecessary – it has always been part of the system and parents have freedom to do this.”Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Increasing use of private tuition reflects the worries that the government has unnecessarily created in so many parents’ minds about school standards and students’ prospects.“Although offering support to students whose parents cannot afford private tuition may seem appealing, any extra funding available for disadvantaged students should be directed at addressing the shortfalls in pupil premium funding and the government’s decision to favour schools in less disadvantaged areas in its own recent funding announcement.”The Ipsos Mori survey of pupils questioned 2,809 children aged 11-16 in secondary schools in England and Wales between 12 February and 24 May.The National Foundation for Educational Research Teacher Voice Omnibus survey polled 1,678 practising state school teachers in England between 1-6 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d841323a5a3992736f3b0e7447ab1bcb8e370700/80_76_3271_1963/master/3271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=836891eec9a9dde3d8c25978302b6ed7","title":"greta thunbergs 495 word un speech points us to a future of hope or despair","story":"The speech draws the battle lines between those of us who want action on climate change and those, like Trump, who only mock itGreta Thunberg’s address to the UN’s Climate Action Summit on Monday may well prove to be the climate change movement’s Gettysburg Address. Like Abraham Lincoln’s revered speech, which ran to 273 words, Thunberg’s was also very short, only 495 words long.Lincoln famously spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery, following the leading orator of the day, Edward Everett, who took two hours to deliver the official address, a 13,000 word oration. Lincoln’s speech, simply described in the day’s official program as Dedicatory Remarks, lasted less than three minutes.Thunberg would similarly have had some good acts to follow at a UN talk-fest, but her presence would not, at first glance, seem to be of the same significance as those of the various world leaders who had gathered for the event.And yet it is Thunberg’s speech, which took just four-and-a-half minutes to deliver, which, one suspects, will resonate long into the future.In the manner that was then traditional, Everett’s marathon speech, deemed very good by the standards of the day, was rich with classical allusion. But Lincoln used no classical reference. Instead, in a way that it is hard to appreciate from this distance of time, he was profoundly modern, using Biblical phrasing and rhythms that appealed to a population for whom the Book was the word, not Sophocles.Thunberg’s speech was similarly phrased in the contemporary argot pitched to the polarising force of social media’s algorithms, suffused with a contained rage. For she came not with a dream, but a nightmare, the scientific truth of climate change succinctly put in five paragraphs. Her dreams, she said, had been stolen from her along with her childhood.Thunberg’s speech used phrases and ideas she has deployed before and to better effect. So too Lincoln. But what gives both speeches their enormous power is timing, each coming after historic events the significance of which had not yet been fully understood and was still in the process of creation.In Lincoln’s case it was the Battle of Gettysburg that had taken place a few months earlier, now regarded as a turning point in the civil war. In Thunberg’s case it was the massive global strike of schoolchildren a few days earlier inspired by her original, solitary strike on the steps of the Swedish parliament.Lincoln’s speech sought to give meaning to the enormous blood sacrifice of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the war more generally in doing so he was shaping the future of the war and his nation.Thunberg’s singular achievement was to present the climate change issue as a battle for power. In doing so she spoke with the authority of the millions who marched only a few days before. For this Donald Trump trolled her. He intuited her power and tried to destroy it through mockery.In her speech Thunberg sets up an opposition between the plural we – those who want action on climate change – and a strangely singular use of the word you – those who don’t.And though she was speaking to an audience largely composed of those with power, her you was not only the assembled global leaders but everyone, and her we, while directly referring to the young and Friday’s three million marchers, was a we open to all, infinitely expandable.For the you is not just Trump or Scott Morrison or a fossil fuel company executive. Her you is personal. It is each of us who hears but as if in a nightmare cannot act. Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing, condemning yourself to the ranks of those who the future “will never forgive”?On Wednesday the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the nation’s creepy gaslighter-in-chief, criticised Thunberg for similar reasons to Trump, saying, “I think we’ve got to caution against raising the anxieties of children in our country.”Since 1996 – seven years before Greta Thunberg was born – the Liberal party has been working assiduously to advance the cause of fossil fuel companies at the expense of our future. Morrison’s paternalistic piffle is just one more piece of grotesque bad faith on an issue about which the Liberal record is one of lying, scheming and wrecking at every step for over two decades. With his bluster of quiet Australians, Morrison is trying to pull a spit hood over the nation to silence us all.Recently released Australian cabinet papers reveal the Howard Liberal government was conspicuously campaigning in 1996 against legally binding, uniform emission reduction targets in the Kyoto protocol, with the prime minister’s advocacy to key world leaders proving “influential”. When uniform targets were eventually dropped, the Liberal cabinet praised John Howard’s negotiating strategy.“Australia is in a special position,” the cabinet papers record Howard saying. “We are a developed country that is a major exporter of energy.”And so it went for the next two decades. With the Liberals and the Murdoch press running political cover, the fossil fuel industries ramped up and up. By 2019 the Liberal party had defined itself as the party of coal, and a craven Labor party, after its defeat in the most recent election, is now following its lead. Today Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and LNG, and over the next decade Australia hopes to double its coal production. In consequence Australia is well on the way to becoming a pariah state along with the likes of Russia and Saudi Arabia, its people hostage to the profits of its fossil fuel industry.The gross corruption of Australian public life so recently on display with examples of large sums of money from the Chinese Communist party seeming to flow into both Liberal and Labor coffers show exactly how easily purchased an enfeebled and unresponsive Australian democracy has become. And the corollary, the shameful, shared refusal of both Labor and Liberal parties to back a much-needed national corruption commission suggests only the obvious: the depth and breadth of corruption of our national polity.And yet while avoiding the criminality among their own, our leaders have been keen to criminalise those who actively campaign for our future. Queensland – the epicentre for major new coalmines – has significantly strengthened its laws against environmental protesters while lawyers for the Adani mine have publicly stated that they will seek to bankrupt any opponents of their new coalmine, the most controversial in the world, commercially viable only with the subsidies and tax breaks given for its consumption by the Indian government and for its production by Australian governments.When Morrison infamously brandished a lump of coal in parliament he told Australians not to be scared.But we should be.Australia is already living the grim consequences of climate change. If the world continues on its present trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years. The climate collapse is here.For over 30 years those who wished for action on climate change have believed that reason and truth would persuade those with power to act. But it is not so, and it did not prove to be so, and therein lies much of the reason carbon levels continue to rise and the planet’s very future is today hanging by the thinnest of threads.For power never gives to reason. Power bends only to power. And on Monday a schoolgirl raised the spectre of an opposing power that is now rising around the world and which will not be satisfied by those “who can only talk about money and fairytales of eternal economic growth”.“The young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you … We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”Watching Greta Thunberg’s speech I understood what last Friday was about: a historic turning point where for the first time the power of we met the power of you without artifice, without compromise and with a ferocious courage.Millions marched last Friday. The next march will be bigger. The battle lines are finally clear. And each of us must now decide: am I you or am I we?

I love its pastoral elegance – it feels and tastes like you’ve stolen the soul from an autumn woodland. That feeling (accentuated perhaps by how many ciders you’ve drunk), is a testament to good ingredients and simple cooking. If you can’t find ceps or porcini mushrooms locally during the autumn months, then, of course, you can buy them online from a variety of wild- and foraged-food specialists. There are alternatives: firm, cultivated chestnut mushrooms would work really well, too.Serves 2Jerusalem artichokes 350g (about 6-8), peeled, skins reservedgarlic 2 cloves, bashed but skin onthyme 4 sprigsextra virgin olive oil 3 tbsp butter 1 knob sunflower oil for deep fryingcep mushrooms 2 large, cut into 1cm sliceschives 1 small bunch, finely choppedsalt and freshly ground black pepperHeat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Cut the peeled artichokes into 3cm cubes. Place the cubes into a roasting tray, with the garlic cloves, thyme sprigs and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season all over with salt and pepper, then place in the oven. Roast, stirring once or twice, for about 1 hour, or until the artichoke cubes are tender and caramelised. Squeeze the softened garlic flesh from its skin and place it in a blender with the roasted artichoke, the butter and just enough water to loosen, then blitz to a smooth, spoonable puree. Check the seasoning and keep warm.Wash the reserved artichoke skins, drain and pat dry (they need to be completely dry for frying). Heat 2-3cm of sunflower oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. When it’s hot enough for frying (170C on a cooking thermometer or when a cube of bread sizzles and crisps quickly), fry the skins in batches for about 1-1½ minutes each, until crisp and golden. Don’t let them get too dark or they will taste bitter. Drain each batch on kitchen paper, then season with salt and set aside.Heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat until hot. Season the mushroom slices with salt and pepper and place them in the pan. Fry the slices for 2-3 minutes on each side, until they have taken on some colour. Remove the pan from the heat and stir through half the chopped chives. Divide the artichoke puree between two plates. Arrange the fried mushrooms around this, then scatter over the crispy artichoke skin.

This one is different, here the base is a beautiful spiced broth in which the celeriac is poached until you can mash it against the side of the pan using a wooden spoon and it thickens in the broth. It isn’t traditional, but it has warmth, body and spice, which are all good company in autumn.Serves 4rapeseed oil 4 tbsp black mustard seeds 1 tsp fresh curry leaves 12 onions 2, choppedginger 3cm piece, gratedgarlic 3 cloves, mincedgreen finger chillies 2½, finely choppedground cumin 1½ tsp salt 1 tsp celeriac 1 small (around 400g), peeled and cut into 3cm piecestomato puree 1 tbsp fish stock 750ml hake fillets 600g, cut into pieces (3cm)baby leaf spinach 100g lemon juice 1 tbsp to serve lemon wedges and basmati riceIn a large sauté pan or casserole, for which you have a lid, heat the oil and, when hot, add the mustard seeds and curry leaves. When the mustard seeds start to pop, add the onions. Cook for 10 minutes, then add the ginger, garlic, chilli, cumin and salt and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the celeriac, tomato puree and stock, bring to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.Once the celeriac pieces are tender, use a stick blender or potato masher to crush about 8 pieces of celeriac, to add texture to the sauce. Finally, add the pieces of hake and baby spinach, cover with a lid and simmer for 4-5 minutes until the spinach has wilted and the fish is just cooked through. Take off the heat, squeeze over the lemon juice, and serve with rice.Meera Sodha is a food writer and the author of East (Penguin, £20)Baked or poached fruits cry out for a crisp accompaniment – a ginger snap, perhaps, or a triangle of sugar-dusted shortbread.

While the butter and sugar cream, lightly toast the skinned almonds in the oven on a baking sheet then, when they are golden, remove from the oven.Reduce the toasted almonds and 65g pistachios to fine crumbs in a food processor. When the butter and sugar are soft, beat in the maple syrup, alternating with some of the flour and the ground nuts. Transfer the dough to a board, roll into a fat cylinder and wrap in greaseproof paper or clingfilm then refrigerate for 30 minutes.Cut the dough in half, then, on a floured board, roll out one half to a rectangle about 5mm thick. Use a biscuit cutter to make roughly 15 biscuits. Place them, with a little room to spread, on parchment-lined baking trays. Now repeat with the second half of the dough.Roughly chop the remaining 55g pistachios and scatter them over the biscuits, then bake in batches for 12-15 minutes.

Use a small knife to score the flesh of the aubergines in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through the skin. Mix the olive oil with the garlic, salt and pepper, and brush very generously all over the flesh of the aubergines. Place on a tray in the oven and roast, cut-side up, for 15-20 minutes or until the flesh is beautifully golden and feels soft when pressed. Remove from the oven.In the meantime, place the diced onion and oil in a frying pan over a high heat and cook until golden.

Beckie’s hat-trick and a goal from the substitute Bremer ensured Nick Cushing’s team swept past Swiss side Lugano 11-1 on aggregate and into the Champions League round of 16.“It’s great to be able to contribute,” said Beckie. “Those three are a huge loss for us as a team, but Pauline’s been on fire, she is a raw goalscorer, Caroline Weir has been our best player so far this season and it’s nice to be in that group of players, I’m a striker, it’s good to score goals. And it’s great to make Nick’s job harder.”It was always going to be routine for City with a six-goal cushion, courtesy of their 7-1 defeat of the Swiss side on the road, and with ‘Janine, Janine’ ringing round the ground to the tune of Blondie’s ‘Denis’, the 949 fans made sure they would enjoy progressing further than they did last year, when they went out to unseeded Atlético Madrid.“I’m really pleased,” said Cushing, when asked of Bremer and Beckie’s goals. “In previous years we’ve assembled a squad where we’ve known our XI and had maybe seven or eight players we can call upon in some games.“Last year and this year we’ve assembled a squad where we’ve got consistency across the board.”It took just five minutes for City to dash any meagre hopes of a comeback, Keira Walsh threading a pass to Beckie who dinked it smoothly over Morgan Bertsch from just inside the box. After the half-hour City doubled their lead. Cushing gave chances to the Ireland youngster Tyler Toland and the 17-year-old Jess Park, who both impressed, but it was the more experienced Walsh and Beckie partnership that would give the manager the option of resting a few more legs. Walsh broke to the byline before slipping a cross across the face of goal for Beckie to poke in.Cushing was full of praise for Walsh: “I will not hold back, she is up there with the most intelligent players I have worked with. She is pivotal for us.”This was much more comfortable for City. The Nationalliga A runners-up Lugano have become an unlikely home for former US college players. They have 16 Americans in their ranks and 10 were in the starting line up to face City, with English defender Helen Seed the outlier (she too, though, played NCAA football).Former NWSL player Beckie was the difference for City, and just two minutes after the break she had her third. A weak attempt at a clearance fell kindly at Beckie’s feet and the Canadian turned and powered a shot high past Bertsch. Bremer added a fourth, and her seventh in all competitions, when she carried the ball from deep, rounded Bertsch and prodded towards goal as she slipped to the ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec26238f766f5acb52b934fcd297903cbc98cf7/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8df6539a4685bce137683b455137e3f6","title":"manchster united rochdale carabao cup match report","story":"Manchester United squeezed through to the Carabao Cup fourth round, 5-3 on penalties, Daniel James confidently dispatching the decisive kick on a night when Rochdale gave Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s men an almighty scare.Yet the result should not mask the latest worrying display, one that followed Saturday’s defeat at West Ham, as they were taken to spot-kicks by a 16-year-old right-back named Luke Matheson. He will long remember his 76th-minute equaliser and sprint to celebrate in front of the Rochdale fans he had sent into ecstasy.Matheson, an A-level student, will be 17 next week but it was United’s own 17-year-old, Mason Greenwood, whose earlier strike appeared to have won the tie. United then drew Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the next round and the manager said: “If you want to win it you have to beat the best.”Solskjær had retained only Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Andreas Pereira from the West Ham loss. The headline inclusion was Axel Tuanzebe who, at 21, captained United in only a 10th appearance. He was the youngest to do so since a 20-year-old Norman Whiteside in 1985. This was despite Paul Pogba’s first start for close to a month because of injury.Brian Barry-Murphy’s side are 17th in League One, six points above the relegation zone after nine games, yet reached the break on level terms.Of particular interest was how Greenwood would perform in his first game as United’s No 9 – and he impressed. He would have had a first clear chance if Pogba had turned a far-post header to him. Moments later, he was put in along the left by the same player but his control faltered.United seemed to be moving closer to the breakthrough: Greenwood crossed the ball in from the right, yet Pogba’s header was a particularly woeful miss. Possession was largely United’s but they lacked the class and composure to make it count.There was then a real scare for the United defence: it could do nothing as Ollie Rathbone – once of United – found Callum Camps and suddenly Wan-Bissaka had to clear off the line.This had the packed away end delirious and the home support wondering what, precisely, their team was doing. Rochdale could start to believe the upset was on.Greenwood was United’s brightest player, as he continued to pop up in and around Robert Sánchez’s goal.The sign of United’s desperate times came on the hour when Solskjær replaced the toothless Tahith Chong for James, whose impact was instant, laying off a pass to Greenwood whose shot forced Sánchez to concede a corner.Then United had the breakthrough and Brandon Williams, on his debut aged 19, was instrumental. He found Pereira, who relayed the ball to Jesse Lingard: Greenwood took over, and it was 1-0. Yet now came the twist as Matheson raced in from the right and buried a finish past Sergio Romero and penalties beckoned.Rathbone finished disappointed but proud. “It was amazing We were expecting to get drummed here. We did really well,” he said. Solskjær added: “You know we’re better in penalty shootouts than in proper games.” He was joking yet some fans may be worried that such a jest is now true of their team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/170d8aac7e132770433b5d43cd984c9e19c24eb2/0_51_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad909eff661dc44d0f068da524c2a5a","title":"oxford ease past west ham united shock carabao cup victory football","story":"Manuel Pellegrini took full responsibility after West Ham crashed out of the Carabao Cup following this humbling at Oxford. The League One side scored four unanswered goals via Elliott Moore, Matty Taylor, Tariqe Fosu and the excellent Shandon Baptiste to progress into the fourth round for the first time in 22 years.West Ham had made nine changes after the 2-0 win at home to Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday and Pellegrini said: “The whole team didn’t play well.“Not only did we concede four goals, but we didn’t create too many chances. We missed too many passes from the beginning and the responsibility is first on me because I picked the players and second of course on the team that didn’t compete.“The players must understand, but I repeat we couldn’t do it because in front was a team that played very well. I don’t want to take anything away from Oxford because they played very well.”Only Issa Diop and Pablo Fornals retained their starting berths from the win over United, but Pellegrini introduced Felipe Anderson and Sébastien Haller off the bench early in the second half. He defended his team selection here, insisting it was a necessity because of their fixture schedule.He said: “I think in England if you want to play in all the competitions you need to use your whole squad. You cannot just continue with the same players that play on Saturday.”West Ham supporters were making plenty of noise during the opening exchanges, including mocking their London rivals Tottenham, who were dumped out of the competition on penalties at Colchester on Tuesday. But Oxford delivered a brutal shock to send another Premier League side out.Pellegrini’s counterpart, Karl Robinson, was delighted with his players and urged the 9,000 home supporters to turn up again for Saturday’s league fixture with Gillingham. “We had the belief in ourselves that we could get a result,” he said.“I’m over the moon for the fans and the players. It’s about the players, about the fans and about the community of Oxfordshire and the big thing for me now is the people who came here for the first time in a long time, that they buy a ticket and come on Saturday. We want them to support us moving forward because economical growth is important for what we are trying to achieve.”Robinson, who masterminded a 4-0 win against Manchester United five years ago as MK Dons manager, admitted the result was one of Oxford’s best at home in recent years, surpassing their FA Cup wins against Newcastle and Swansea.“Looking at the scoreboard, 4-0 against West Ham and a very strong West Ham, this will probably go down as one of the biggest results at the Kassam in recent years.”Robinson’s side quickly got back into their stride after the substitution and hit the crossbar with when Hall’s free kick almost crept in.West Ham responded with the lively Holland testing Simon Eastwood from a tight angle on the left before Moore cleared the loose ball. Jack Wilshere tried his luck from range in the 32nd minute, yet it was a comfortable for the U’s goalkeeper.Robert Snodgrass was denied a shot on goal by Rob Dickie early in the second period before the hosts’ confidence increased again when Roberto sliced a clearance behind for a corner.West Ham survived that set piece and the next, but Robinson’s team kept the ball alive and Mark Sykes crossed in for Moore, who controlled and fired into the bottom corner from eight yards. shock was firmly on the cards and Sykes was giving Arthur Masuaku plenty of problems and almost created a second for Oxford two minutes later when Mackie flicked goalwards, but Roberto produced a brilliant stop to save the Hammers. It was one-way traffic, with the U’s eager for a second and Pellegrini reacted by introducing Sebastien Haller and Felipe Anderson, but it failed to have the desired effect.Oxford increased their lead with 19 minutes left. Sykes was allowed too much space on the right and he crossed in for Taylor to tap home at the back post. Fosu, fresh from a hat-trick at Lincoln on Saturday, then slipped past Arthur Masuaku, rounded Roberto and slotted home. In added time Baptiste side-footed into the bottom corner to send Oxford into the fourth round, and with it a home tie against Sunderland, for the first time since 1997."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a7b14ca216ca8090482db286463a48586580654/0_60_3861_2317/master/3861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28a263cf1771cde59857982ac0d216a8","title":"football transfer rumours christian eriksen to sign for real madrid in january","story":"Today’s fluff is only just getting startedAs if the mood at Tottenham had not already sufficiently soured, with gloom suddenly clouding all of Mauricio Pochettino’s good work as a minority of forgetful supporters stick the boot in, Real Madrid plan to further rock the boat by getting their hands on Christian Eriksen as early as January. The idea is that the midfielder will sign a pre-contract agreement ahead of a free transfer next summer. Oh, and once that’s done, it says here Real will plump for Pochettino too. The Spurs contingency plan? Massimiliano Allegri, apparently.Losing to Colchester doesn’t feel quite so bad now, does it? Manchester United, too, are close to a full-blown meltdown after eking past a Rochdale side spearheaded by Aaron Wilbraham, who turns 40 next month. United could do with a sage striker with bundles of experience, and that is why Ed Woodward is jumping up and down at the prospect of signing 33-year-old Mario Mandzukic. The Juventus striker has supposedly turned his nose up at a lucrative move to sweltering Qatar, a £7m-a-year contract, in favour of joining Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s revolution of sorts in January.Looking further down the line, United would love to sign Harry Kane – of course they would – but Tottenham have issued the kind of hands-off that belongs in the Football Manager franchise, with Daniel Levy not just putting a price tag on the England captain’s head but slapping a £250m valuation on his man. Kane wants to win trophies but Levy, as ever, is determined to dig his heels in next summer if need be.Elsewhere, Boca Juniors fancy a season of headlines, which is why they are trying to land Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is out of contract at LA Galaxy in December. Then there is the Red Bull Salzburg and Norway striker Erling Braut Haaland, who unsurprisingly has Premier League scouts weak at the knees after 14 goals in his last 10 appearances for club and country, while Everton and Arsenal are set to battle for PSV winger Donyell Malen. Beyond that, it is slim pickings but Phillip Cocu has been credited with an interest in bringing the Peterborough pair Ivan Toney and Marcus Maddison, who is out of contract next summer, to Derby County."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15614b11731b7793adfbb46ee628260fff4a688d/0_159_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b24e4093f9a9aeee55882afb1a7477","title":"leonardo dicaprio urged to end support for indian river project","story":"Charities warn actor that Cauvery tree-planting scheme could harm endangered waterway and its environs Leonardo DiCaprio has been urged to withdraw support for a controversial tree-planting programme in India, which could result in catastrophic environmental damage.An open letter, signed by more than 90 Indian environmental and rights groups, warned that the Hollywood actor and activist’s endorsement of the Cauvery Calling campaign was ill-advised. The signatories said the campaign could lead to the “drying up of streams and rivulets, and destruction of wildlife habitats”.The Cauvery is an endangered river in southern India.The letter praised DiCaprio’s work in “promoting rights of indigenous communities, protecting wildlife, case sensitively promoting conservation strategies, and, needless to state, pushing for clear action to tackle global warming”.But the charities added: “It appears to us, the Coalition for Environmental Justice in India, however, that you may not have been appropriately advised in supporting the Cauvery Calling campaign.”The letter continued: “This is not a programme that will protect Cauvery, her forests, her bioersity, her children, and her children’s children. It will certainly not save Cauvery.”The campaign was launched by the Isha Foundation, created by “Sadhguru” Jaggi Vasudev.Sadhguru is a celebrity mystic who tours the world attending Hollywood events, offering spiritual advice and meditation tips, and has endorsements from numerous Bollywood celebrities.The guru has made various controversial public statements, referring to one Muslim student as “Taliban” and calling liberals “fanatics.”The Cauvery Calling campaign collects donations online to plant 2.42bn trees along the banks of the Cauvery river. According to a ticker on its website, it has already collected enough funds to plant 40m trees.But activists have said the tree-planting drive is too simplistic.“The river has 81,000 square metres of watershed shared between four states,” said Leo Saldanha, co-ordinator of the Bangalore-based Environment Support Group.Saldhana said that different stretches of land in the region had different requirements and that blanket tree-planting could cause enormous environmental degradation and a loss to farmer livelihoods.DiCaprio posted an endorsement of the Cauvery Calling campaign on his Facebook page on Saturday, and his environmental charity Earth Sense has previously hosted the spiritual leader at an event in Los Angeles. “Sadhguru has all kinds of endorsement from politicians to film stars and billionaires,” Saldahna said. “Environmental organisations are trying to develop proper, ground-up strategies to address these complex issues. They don’t work with us because we don’t use populism. We don’t use religion. This is an evangelical religious foundation. DiCaprio is a great actor and an intelligent conversationalist, but he is lending a hand and globally legitimising it.”DiCaprio and his foundation have previously come under scrutiny in Malaysia, after a Department of Justice probe into alleged links to a money laundering scheme that reportedly supported his environmental foundation and his film The Wolf of Wall Street.Sadhguru’s organisation has been criticised previously by India’s comptroller and auditor general for disregarding environmental and humanitarian laws and even building its Coimbatore headquarters on protected forest land known for its elephant corridor. The foundation has denied that it was built on an elephant corridor.Environmentalists have also filed a court case against the Isha Foundation, alleging that the project started collecting donations for the programme before receiving clearances from state governments to plant trees.DiCaprio’s publicists did not respond to a request for comment from the . The actor, who has repeatedly used his public prominence to decry the impact of climate change, is understood to have contributed at least $30m to environmental causes.An email to the Isha Foundation also went unanswered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209c6913855b5d592b99b6f7d55f2989","title":"tell us about the moment you realised your cat loved you","story":"If you have lived with a cat we’d like to hear your stories about when you discovered they returned your affectionCats, it turns out, love humans more than we might think.

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

Her widower, Brendan Cox, swiftly condemned the prime minister’s remarks, saying it had left him feeling sick.Johnson’s attitude was lambasted by Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, who called him a “disgrace” and Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister, who said she felt “disgust watching Johnson”, describing him as “untrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions”. Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, said his reaction showed that Johnson was “a cruel, uncaring, spoilt man”.Swinson revealed on Wednesday that she had reported to police a death threat against her young child.Amber Rudd, who resigned from Johnson’s cabinet earlier this month, told ITV the prime minister was being “dishonest and dangerous” in his use of language.Jess Phillips, the Labour MP and women’s rights campaigner, highlighted an anonymous death threat she had personally received, quoting Johnson’s image that he would rather be dead in a ditch than fail to deliver Brexit. “That is what will happen to those who fail to deliver Brexit,” it said.“10 Downing Street might think we are ‘humbugs’ about his words but they are literally being used in death threats against me,” she said.“I get death threats and still I stand up. I don’t surrender to fear and aggression. I don’t surrender to lowest common denominator of fear to votes. I don’t surrender to bullies who call me names. It is not I who have surrendered, it is Boris Johnson. He has surrendered his dignity.”John Bercow, the Speaker, implicitly rebuked Johnson and told MPs that he had also received threats: “Each and every one of us has a responsibility to weigh his or her words ... with care, eloquence, humour but in terms that demonstrate respect for those who hold a point of view that differs from our own.”Jeremy Corbyn called on the Speaker to call together the leaders of all parties to issue a joint declaration “opposing any form of abusive language or threats and to put this message out to our entire community that we have to treat each other with respect”.“If we don’t, then what happens is those on our streets who would do violence feel emboldened to do it and the most vulnerable people in our society suffer as a result of it,” the Labour leader added.Bercow said he was “very open” to the idea of convening a meeting to draw up a house-wide public statement.After an aggressive debate in parliament, with the prime minister accusing the opposition of signing a “surrender act” over Brexit, Sherriff received applause from the opposition benches for calling on Johnson to stop using such language.“We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,” she said.“And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words ‘surrender act’, ‘betrayal’, ‘traitor’ and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.”Johnson replied with a half-smile, saying: “I have to say Mr Speaker I’ve never heard such humbug in all my life.”He was also confronted by Brabin, who criticised him for using language such as “surrender”, arguing it cast his opponents as traitors.“As the woman who has taken over a seat left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him in all honesty as a human being please, please will he going forward moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when we’re going about our jobs?” she said.However, Johnson responded by repeating some of the language and suggesting the answer was to deliver Brexit.“Of course there will be an attempt to try to obfuscate the effect of this Act, but it does – the capitulation act, or the surrender act or whatever you want to call it – it does, I’m sorry, but it greatly enfeebles, it greatly enfeebles this government’s ability to negotiate.“But what I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.”Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, condemned the abuse that MPs had received as “deeply, deeply unpleasant and troubling”.He said: “We all have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we’re speaking in this house or outside.“I’m afraid to say it’s something where all sides err from time to time and it would be invidious to pick on inidual examples but we have a responsibility of leadership.”Former Tory Anna Soubry raised a point of order to criticise the prime minister’s language: “It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears ... but I am not alone tonight. There are others who have left the estate such has been the distress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858235a242932e60c4f97a9d0e9f0f4dbc89d35/550_1136_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd37fda1ac9629420d15a993b876c1c","title":"can labour unite and plot a path to power","story":"Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour’s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit strategy.

They have teat-shaped spouts, appear designed to be easily held by an older baby or toddler and one is shaped as an imaginary animal, suggesting it may have doubled as a toy. Julie Dunne, a chemist at the University of Bristol and lead author, said: “These very small, evocative, vessels give us valuable information on how and what babies were fed thousands of years ago, providing a real connection to mothers and infants in the past.”The finding suggests that a shift towards weaning babies earlier could have played a crucial role in a population boom that occurred in the Neolithic period, around the same time that some humans moved away from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle towards one that depended on crops and animals. “It could help explain why Neolithic women can suddenly have many more babies,” said Dunne. “There’s so much more to it than the baby bottle.”Small feeding vessels, made from clay, first appear in Europe in the Neolithic (at around 5,000 BC), and become more commonplace during the bronze and iron ages that follow. However, it has not been clear whether the pots were specifically made for babies – it has also been suggested they were used to feed the sick or elderly.The latest findings provide a vital link, showing that three vessels found in child burial sites were filled with animal milk. A chemical analysis of lipids that survived in the bottom of the pot suggests that the milk would have come from a cow, goat or sheep.The children that the bottles were found alongside had ages of between one to two years, around two and under six years.Katharina Rebay-Salisbury, a co-author from the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, said: “Bringing up babies in prehistory was not an easy task. We are interested in researching cultural practices of mothering, which had profound implications for the survival of babies.”She said that the development of bottles could have made mothering a more “collective” responsibility, at a time when people were starting to live in larger groups, with some settlements of several hundred people. Stopping breastfeeding infants at an earlier age could also have led to shorter gaps between siblings.Rebay-Salisbury, who is leading a major project on motherhood in prehistory, said that there is a growing realisation that studying how children lived in the past could provide crucial insights into ancient societies. “For a long time, people were just interested in swords and men,” she said. “Gradually we’re discovering that there were other people as well who deserve our attention, including children and mothers.”The team is planning to analyse other, similar artefacts. “Similar vessels, although rare, do appear in other prehistoric cultures, such as Rome and ancient Greece, across the world,” said Dunne. “Ideally, we’d like to carry out a larger geographic study and investigate whether they served the same purpose.”The analysis is published in the journal Nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2195fff7877319f166b98f2e55d4258e041fd0df/89_34_1983_1190/master/1983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d53eec76e96074b46e1eb50e6f332a07","title":"dina asher smith history three medals world athletics championships","story":"No British athlete has left a world championships with three medals clanking from their neck. But Dina Asher-Smith’s form is so ominous that the bookies give her a better than 5050 shot of writing a new chapter in track and field history. They are running scared. Her opponents could be forgiven for feeling the same way.After all, Asher-Smith is this year’s Diamond League winner over 100m, the clear favourite for gold over 200m, and the vital cog in Britain’s 4x100m women’s relay team who won silver in London two years ago. For most people in the sport it is not a question of whether she will win a medal in Doha, but how many and of which colour.That is an enormous weight for Asher-Smith to bear on her 23-year-old shoulders, especially given that – Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Laura Muir apart – the British team do not possess a deep well of inidual medal talent at these championships.Asher-Smith insists that she has been planning to go global since 2017 – and is now ready to deliver. “My coach John Blackie has been putting me through my paces for a very long time to prepare for this,” she said.“When we came off London 2017 and went into training for 2018, that was when we made the decision that I was going to double up and that is the time period you need to build up the strength to be able to put together six elite standard sprint races in a championships. We have been preparing for a very, very long time. It has been painful. John has been testing me. When he tells me: ‘You are doing this today,” I am like: ‘What?’“But we have been preparing and that is why the decision to double up isn’t one that I have taken lightly, it’s not a flippant decision.”The European championships last year in Berlin proved the perfect dress rehearsal as Asher-Smith beat her British records in running 10.85sec to win the 100m and 21.89 to take the 200m before winning her third gold in leading the relay team to victory with a stunning anchor leg. This time she knows it will be tougher, especially in the 100m where she faces the formidable Jamaican Olympic champions Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Elaine Thompson, who have both run 10.73 this season. The word from the Jamaican camp is that both are in fantastic shape for Doha, which could put gold out of reach for Asher-Smith in that event.However in the 200m she is clearly the women to beat, especially with the Bahaman Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who has not lost a race since 2017, deciding to only run the 400m because of scheduling issues.While Asher-Smith knows a podium place in the 100m or 200m would make her the first British woman since Kathy Smallwood-Cook in 1983 to win a global sprint medal, she insists she is not feeling the pressure. “Weirdly enough I don’t and I think that is because I tune out of social media. We have been very clear, John and I, about what my aims are for this season. And we don’t really publicly disclose that until afterwards and that is done deliberately to control expectation.“There definitely is a little bit of expectation but it is something that is nice and something that is refreshing as a British female sprinter – we expect you to do X, Y and Z.”However as she prepares for her first race, in the 100m heats on Saturday, Asher-Smith knows she is facing a moment of truth. “The world championships is going to be the first time where we see everybody with nowhere to hide this year. There’s no ‘I wasn’t ready for this, I wasn’t ready for this’, because if you are not ready for the world championships, when are you ready?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/776c79fb627c5002720c10fba13f3247d4aa0ddd/0_299_5134_3080/master/5134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0783ca853d7ed85c1f789b59e19e7fb","title":"england usa rugby world cup","story":"Having sapped a few spirits in Sapporo last Sunday England’s next objective is to put the “ko” into Kobe, Japan’s most enthusiastic rugby city. Waiting until their key pool games against Argentina and France to underline their genuine World Cup pedigree is theoretically fine but, as Wales showed against Georgia, it is never too early to catch and pass with precision and give their future opponents something to ponder.A four-day turnaround including a hasty flight south, on the other hand, have allowed precious little time for reflection on the Tonga game and England’s plan for the USA Eagles was preordained a while ago. The objective is simple: get the job done as simply and effectively as possible before moving on to the crunchier fixtures in Tokyo which will determine the final pecking order in Pool C. While they pride themselves on their world-class beef hereabouts, Eddie Jones’s side do not want to make a meal of this particular contest.It could well prove more awkward than some are envisaging. In past tournaments it has generally been the lower-ranked nations who have been required to back up within 96 hours of a bruising Test. This time it is the Eagles who have been enjoying the luxury of uninterrupted preparation on the island of Okinawa while England have been playing and shaking out their suitcases. A similar schedule clearly did not help Fiji against Uruguay, mentally or physically. When Gary Gold, the USA head coach, talked up Jones’s squad as having no apparent weaknesses he slyly omitted to mention he and his Eagles have been targeting this game for months.Much work has gone in to improving their set-piece and they will be equally keen to test England physically and via their tactical kicking.Get ahead and there are few more committed sides in terms of putting bodies on the line. England’s challenge – which partly explains the starting XV Jones has named – will involve making the most of any ball kicked their way, utilising their pace out wide and retaining possession rather better than they did against the Tongans. “The one area we really want to impress with is our attack and keeping hold of the ball,” said Joe Launchbury, one of 13 players in the matchday 23 not involved in Sapporo. Over their midweek team lunch largely consisting of the aforementioned Kobe beef, however, it might have been worth someone raising the subject of the 2007 version of this fixture in Lens when England made desperately heavy weather of beating a spirited American side and lost their then‑captain, Phil Vickery, for their big pool game against South Africa after he was banned for a trip on the Eagles centre Paul Emerick.For Jones to lose a key player or two to a similarly out-of-the-blue incident or injury would be untimely to say the least. Nor does he want to see those currently not perceived as first-choice starters trying to throw miracle passes or veering “off script” in a bid to further their inidual chances of selection against the Pumas. The USA may be ranked 13th in the world, below Georgia, but they could pose their opponents more scoreboard problems than Tonga, ranked 15th, ultimately did in Sunday’s 35-3 contest.Gold also knows this stadium well, having coached the local Kobelco Steelers. Kobe is home to a huge port and is Japan’s leading sake-producing region, a combination which may help to explain why its residents love their rugby so much. For seven years in a row between 1989 and 1995 their team won the Top 14 title, inspired by Japan’s so-called “Mr Rugby”, Seiji Hirao, who attended Oxford University, played in three World Cup tournaments and also coached the national side.Hirao died of cancer aged 53 in 2016 but his legacy lives on in Kobe. “It has always been a place where rugby is the predominant sport, which is not the case in most cities in Japan,” said Jones. “There are bars around the town which are dedicated to rugby which is unusual here. Most of the fans are rugby fans, not football fans or baseball fans, so it stands out in that way.”Rugby, furthermore, played its part in rebuilding morale following the 1995 Kobe earthquake which killed almost 6,500 people but Jones’s most abiding sporting memory was a match his Japan side played here in the autumn of 2014. “We had two games against the Maori All Blacks and when we played them here we were beaten by 60 points. We didn’t deliberately go out to get beaten but we deliberately played away from our strengths to send a message to the team about how we were going to play. The next game we played, we got beaten by one point. It reinforced the point we had to play to our strengths.”Jones, apparently, has since attempted something similar as England’s coach, with similar results. “How did it go? Not well. It doesn’t usually go well when you don’t play to your strengths, but it can be a great education for the team.” Soon enough, though, the time for experimentation and tinkering will be over. With Jack Nowell and Henry Slade seemingly on the mend, competition for places is about to intensify further from next week onwards. This is not the moment for England’s midweekers to take their eyes off the ball."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4df9c62eed2868176815582ea79ead6838964c3/0_370_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=245058ac5e1d8428f3e088725a315f03","title":"jane couch britains first licenced female boxer interview","story":"“I just think I’m damaged, like really damaged,” Jane Couch says quietly as the tears roll down her face. She hunches over and her body shakes. This is the painful cost of being the pioneer of women’s boxing in Britain. Couch was the five-time world champion boxer who was barred from fighting in her own country. Just over 20 years ago the British Boxing Board of Control still insisted women were too emotionally unstable to box.On my way to meet Couch I hear that Katie Taylor, the brilliant Irish boxer, will headline a bill at the Manchester Arena on 2 November with Anthony Crolla, a former world champion and much-loved Mancunian, on her undercard. Without Couch’s courage and defiance, Taylor would not be in this position.Couch had to win a court case against the sport’s governing body to make British sporting history in August 1998. Bernard Buckley, the board’s solicitor, built his case on the claim that “many women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.”But Couch had shown her mettle to win her first world title in only her fifth fight in 1996. She had flown to Denmark to face Sandra Geiger, the French world champion who came from a kickboxing background. Couch suffered a broken jaw, shattered cheekbone, fractured eye-socket, cracked ribs and a missing tooth but she still won a unanimous decision over 10 rounds. She and Geiger both ended up in hospital.Her world titles and landmark legal victory were of little benefit to Couch. She still struggled to get fights and there were many times when she travelled abroad and, after brutal bouts, was not even paid. At home Couch was shunned by boxing promoters and mocked on television and in the tabloids.I have known Couch since the late 1990s, when I first interviewed her, and she is one of the most admirable and kindest people I’ve met in boxing. She retired 10 years ago but today, as she relives the past trauma, her usual laughter is replaced by grief. When we take a break, because it is so upsetting for her, Couch says simply: “I wish I hadn’t been the first. I wish I hadn’t gone through all that shit.”The 51-year-old Couch looks up when I say her scars seem more like wounds. “I’m damaged,” she says again. “I didn’t think I was but the counsellors and doctors encourage you to talk. They say: ‘It’s good to get it out. If you hold it in, Jane, you’ll only do more damage.’”She wipes her eyes and apologises for crying. Yet her tears are a sign of strength. They show her candour and fight. “I hope so. I just find it hard. It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don’t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they’d call me a lesbian or a freak.”“Dinah messed them up because they thought she was going only on sex discrimination. She used that but focused on restraint of trade. I was already a double world champion and the board was stopping me making a living in this country. We won but, when I got the licence, I thought: ‘It will be all right now.’ The abuse got worse. Dinah knew it would happen. We left the press conference after the court case. She put her arms around me and goes: ‘I don’t want to tell you this, but your fight’s just beginning.’”Couch’s eyes are clear again. “I know what she means now. I’d be on TV shows like Richard and Judy and they would have phone-ins for people to vote. ‘Is she a freak? Should she be allowed to box?’ When people keep calling you a freak you think, ‘Maybe I am?’ Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn’t see a way out.”A year after she retired, in 2008, Couch had a breakdown. “I was very down. I didn’t want to go out. I was having panic attacks. Other women fighters were sending me messages about their problems. I had pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack.”A friend took Couch to hospital and “this amazing lady doctor told me I was having a panic attack. I was like: ‘How can I have a panic attack? I’m not scared of anything.’ I told her what I did and she said: ‘You’ve got to bury boxing otherwise this will always haunt you.’”Writing her book, and talking about it, has been distressing but Couch knows this is the road to lasting peace. “I wasn’t a skilful boxer. I fought with my heart. I learned that in the gym because I had to be tough – sparring with boys. Those first days in the gym were bad. They’d say: ‘Fuck off, you’re a girl.’ They laughed at me. They’re all skipping brilliant and I’m tripping over the rope. I could hear them laughing but I was thinking: ‘I’ll show you.’”She laughs at her youthful audacity. Before her first world title fight against Geiger she trained for nine months and sparred against well-known male professionals such as Glenn Catley and Dean Francis. “Glenn was a serious puncher but he was good with me. They were all good with me but they still hit me. They’d be no good to me if they didn’t. They taught me to fight back when you’re hurt.”Not one line about her becoming world champion was written in the national press or mentioned on radio or television. “I thought I was going to get mobbed at the airport but no one was there. I got Boxing News that next Friday. I was all excited but there was nothing. My manager shrugged. ‘They don’t do women’s boxing.’ He was as bad as them. A week later he said: ‘You’ve got a defence in New Orleans.’ I didn’t even want to go back to the gym but I convinced myself.”Couch cleared £200, after expenses were deducted, for winning the world title. But the New Orleans promoter said he had no money to pay her after she won another hard fight. At least she ended up having Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali’s trainer, and the great former world champion Matthew Saad Muhammad helping in her corner. Couch also talks about the kindness of Marvin Hagler and Lennox Lewis, and her friendships with Frank Bruno and Ricky Hatton. But her love of boxing has soured.“I wasn’t right a few years before I retired. I went on too long. We did the brain scan. They said: ‘Oh, you’ve had a slight alteration.’ I knew that meant brain damage. They said: ‘If you carry on taking blows it will get progressively worse.’ That’s why I retired.”Does she feel any side-effects now? “Yeah. The memory’s a bit bad. But that’s most fighters, isn’t it? Physically I’m not too bad but I became institutionalised, I think, to the other damage.”Many former fighters suffer from depression and Couch believes “boxing is definitely a factor. So many of my old sparring partners are in prison or on drugs or alcoholics. There’s got to be some connection with boxing when you look at all the lads in jail or on drugs.”Couch’s toughest fight was against Lucia Rijker in Los Angeles in 2003. Rijker is arguably the greatest female boxer in history and Couch survived 10 rounds despite having an eardrum perforated. “I thought I was brain-damaged because there was a roaring in my head and my balance was totally gone. I was swallowing blood and it made a cracking sound. I thought: ‘Seven rounds to go. The damage is done. I might as well carry on.’”After all the pain she suffered for such little reward does she feel any envy when hearing about Taylor’s headlining show? “Not a bit because I’ve buried it all now. What Katie’s done for boxing and women in Ireland is massive. I know because my fella’s Irish. She’s a superstar and that’s how it should be. It just wasn’t like that for me – or most women boxers today. I had a girl telling me her fight’s been cancelled because she didn’t sell enough tickets. That’s more typical of women’s boxing. It’s even been tough for Nicola Adams.”When she won gold at the London Olympics in 2012, Adams made a point of acknowledging her success would not have been possible without Couch carving out a path before her. British boxing’s great female pioneer is still fighting to win her own battle to overcome everything that boxing did to her. Does she feel as if she is winning?“I’m getting there,” she says with a little smile. “I’ve been with my partner Brian for nine years. We’re so happy. It’s helping me find a way out of boxing. It’s hard – but I’m happy when I’m not talking about boxing.”Jane Couch’s The Final Round is published by Pitch"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8157b194ea56f67ec1b0195ffdc106c389e3884/0_284_4841_2904/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d2c361e2b1ee7e1626bc14ccebb7ae7","title":"italy v canada rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"37 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada A break as Canadian prop Hubert Buydens (great name) gets treatment.

Fair to say he’s in at the deep end, here.24 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada An injury break as Benvenuti and Canada’s Conor Keys receive treatment – then as we restart, Canada break through the lively Ben Lesage.

After a spell of possession upfield, captain Tyler Ardron breaks a tackle and offloads to Heaton – but the ball squirms from the replacement’s hands with the line in sight! Ah, what a shame. It was a howler, in truth.15 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada The underdogs are currently missing a tackle per minute, and missing as many as they’re making. Another change for Canada, with Lucas Rumball off, replaced by Matt Heaton. Rumball offers a one word, post-watershed assessment of Canada’s performance as he trudges off.Yikes, this was very easy for Italy.

Allan adds the conversion.11 mins: Italy 10-0 Canada So far, the Canadians look outmatched, and a brief wander upfield is easily repelled by Italy, who force a penalty.

Canada reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 1991, and punched above their weight for the rest of the decade. As their era ended, Italy’s began. The azzurri earned a place in the Six Nations, and two World Cup wins in 2003 continued the upward trajectory.Italy have plateaued since then, serving up two wins (and two losses) in every World Cup since, never escaping the pool stages and going backwards in the Six Nations. Canada, meanwhile, have careened downhill – they lost every game in 2015, and aren’t hoping for much better in Japan.With New Zealand and South Africa also in Pool B, the best these two sides can realistically hope for is third place, and an automatic spot in 2023. They may not be the dark horses they once were, but a World Cup win is a World Cup win. Just ask Uruguay.Kick-off is at 4.45pm local time, 8.45am BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a236bb9c4d8010df5b11a005ca11f6ea2cddc25/274_444_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=118250605fd8e0494017be315fbff178","title":"ben elton return to standup comedy","story":"Back on tour for the first time in 15 years, the trailblazing comedian has some scores to settle. How can he be a sellout, he asks, if he was never radical to begin with?They say you shouldn’t meet your heroes – but my inner 13-year-old would never forgive me if I spurned a chat with Ben Elton. The Young Ones, Blackadder and Saturday Live weren’t just a laugh for me I constructed friendships, my sense of humour, and – let’s face it – my identity around them. Elton was the figurehead of the most exciting moment (give or take a 60s satire boom) in British comedy history, a sparkly-suited, mulleted firebrand blazing a trail for comedy’s punk generation – the so-called “alternative comedians” – to follow.And then he wasn’t. Nowadays you can’t talk about Elton without references to selling out, and to Stewart Lee’s notorious routine comparing him with Osama bin Laden, who “at least lived his life according to a consistent set of ethical principles”. More on that later: Elton has plenty to say on the subject. But then, he’s got plenty to say on every subject. At 60 and a self-described “dad man”, the artist formerly known as Motormouth (the title of his 1987 album) is as voluble as ever in the run-up to his first standup tour in 15 years.He never meant to stay away so long. But his three kids were growing up, he was living mainly in Fremantle, Australia, his wife Sophie’s home town. He had his writing to occupy him: 16 novels now, not to mention three series of Shakespeare sitcom Upstart Crow (plus a stage version, opening in the West End early next year). Which partly explains why he is “as scared as I get” to return to standup. “Which is not proper scared,” he clarifies. “When I started as a comedian, 38 years ago, standup was very, very rough. That was proper scary. If I hadn’t had my cornflakes by 8am on the day I was compering at the Comedy Store, there was no way I was going to eat.”The fear now doesn’t come from any self-doubt about his comedy abilities – or at least, not officially. Elton in conversation is a fascinating mix of self-regard and thin skin. First he tells me he’s “always a bit down” on his standup achievements, and that Sophie had to coax him to return to the stage. Then he’s bullish, claiming that “what I do as a standup is completely unique. You may not like it, but I don’t think there’s anybody like me.”“What I do is I talk about ideas,” he says. “I don’t do gags. I don’t do trivial observations any more because I’ve run out of them. And I assume everybody’s covered everything by now.” What he does is ruminate on the state of the world. Back in the day, that meant tirades about “Thatch” and sexism. Alternative comedy may be thought of as a lefty phenomenon, but “mainly it was a surrealist thing”, he says. “There were only a few of us who stood up for a political point of view.”But now, says Elton, he finds himself in a world where he is far less sure of what he thinks. Rightwing demagoguery, post-truth, post-shame: “In the last third of my life, I am seeing changes that make things that terrified me in the first two-thirds seem like comfortable certainties by comparison.” In such a climate, his 80s bete noire no longer seems so bad “In light of Trump and Johnson,” he says, “I realise there was at least some political morality to Thatcher, even Reagan.” And as for gender, social media, identity politics – well, Elton has just written a novel, Identity Crisis, about all that, and will be addressing it on stage, too.Which could go wrong. The outcomes are mixed at best when middle-aged male standups address modern mores (see Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais). “When I tell people I’m going on tour,” says Elton, “almost everybody says, ‘Ooh, you’re brave.’ It’s so weird! We live in a world where people have somehow convinced themselves that, because there’s a few trolls on Twitter, ‘you can’t say anything, can you?’” He puts on a wheedling voice. “‘How am I going to say something when you can’t say anything?’” He’s fascinated by this – but unlike many of his peers, Elton sees no problem with how language and manners have evolved. “I’ve always been very pro-PC,” he says. “Some people think I invented it. I did it the same day I killed Benny Hill. It was a very busy day for me.”Of course, he’ll be careful what he says on stage. He tells me one joke he’s written concerning trans women – a clever wordplay, generous in spirit, but open to misinterpretation – that, after careful consideration, he’s opted not to use in the show. “These are complicated times. And I do not believe any person of goodwill – male or female, trans or cis – would pretend otherwise.” But he’s got no intention of avoiding the subjects. The threat of a backlash is, he thinks, exaggerated. “There are only a handful of people on any side of a debate who are trolls. Most people, I am certain, wherever they stand, want the best for everyone.” And, in any case, he’s been here before. “Yeah, it’s a bit of a risk – but what are you gonna do? They’re not going to kill me. The Daily Mirror said I should be shot for writing We Will Rock You. So I’m an old hand at this.”Ah, yes. Conversation has come around – as come around it must – to the “sellout” accusation. The idea that Elton – by writing musicals with Tory supporter Andrew Lloyd Webber, by MC-ing the Queen’s golden jubilee concert, by allowing his song to score the inauguration of George W Bush – has betrayed the principles for which he once stood. “Which is quite simply,” he says – blue touch-paper lit – “the most utterly unreasonable and wounding and extremely unhelpful narrative that has ever bedevilled a minor, middle-ground celebrity.”“I’m finally beginning to say something,” says Elton, visibly upset. “I haven’t said anything for 30 years. But it’s been wearying. It just keeps coming around, every interview – ‘So do you feel you’ve sold out?’ Tell me what – apart from that Stewart Lee, whoever he is, thinks I have – might make you ask that?”It’s a pretty extraordinary outburst, this – replete with references to the impact on his family of the vitriol heaped on him for 2013 sitcom The Wright Way – that Elton tries to rein in, but can’t. (“I’ve done what I never do, which is prove to be over-sensitive …”) I offer him a get-out, by emphasising the positive – which is that, to engender such a sharp sense of betrayal, his work was clearly hugely important to people in the first place. And isn’t it fascinating that we can invest so much in, and expect so much of, a comedian?But he’s not biting. For Elton, the accusations make no sense because he never identified as anti-establishment in the first place. “How can you be anti-establishment when you’re on Channel 4? When you’ve written sitcoms for the BBC? This is so silly. Y’know, some people pretend they’re communists. I never suffered from any delusion that that was a good thing to be. I have always been a middle-class, middle-of-the-road farty.”More than that – and greatly to my surprise – he denies any iconoclastic dimension to alternative comedy. “There was no revolutionary intent,” he says, of the movement that radicalised a generation, called out racist and sexist humour, and commissioned a nose-pierced punk (Ade Edmondson’s Vyvyan) to tear the title sequence of twee sitcom The Good Life to shreds. “No one ever tried to break any boundaries or bust the rules. No one ever said, ‘Let’s change comedy.’ And, if anyone had, they would have been very arrogant and doomed to failure. Everybody was just trying to do their best work.”“How arrogant would you have to be,” he goes on, “a fucking, middle-class drama student setting out to take down Benny Hill and Bernard Manning? No,” says Elton, “I just set out to express myself.” And that’s all he’s ever done, he says, in a way that’s true to his centre-left principles. “I’m a Clement Attlee man,” he says – and the criticism he’s received (as has his friend Emma Thompson, who “gets a lot of this, too”) is a classic example of the left “eating itself, because everybody loves to see the left with feet of clay. Which leaves the right rubbing its hands with glee. So I think undermining my voice with the one accusation that is genuinely unfair … I mean, smartarse, not funny, loudmouth – all of that is fine. But the idea that there’s a hypocritical element to who I am is self-evidently without basis. And the accuser should be ashamed of themselves. That’s what I feel.”Phew. You can see why, in that context, the prospect of a few trolls quibbling with his take on 21st-century identity politics might seem small beer to Elton. I end up feeling sorry for the man – traduced way out of proportion to his supposed crimes, despite clearly being a conscientious and thoughtful entertainer, who (notwithstanding his denials) at least bothered to stand for something in the first place.I’m glad he’s returning to the fold. “Look, I’m quite naive,” he says. “I never know when people don’t like me, and I never expect them not to. So I’ve always been surprised when I irritate people.”“But I’ve been doing it since I was a kid. At school, at university, I’ve always been the Mickey Rooney character that everybody resents – ‘Let’s put on a show.’ Of course I don’t want people misunderstanding me or hating me. But I want to keep being that person. I’m excited to be back, and to still be the one saying, ‘Let’s do the show right here.’”• Ben Elton’s tour begins at Dublin Olympia on 27 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25cf5d52dbefc0d076a362caa59d25017124256a/522_714_4090_2454/master/4090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8236e138243214fc1d05b27e2f74a2ee","title":"best true wireless earbuds airpods samsung jabra sennheiser anker compared and ranked","story":"Our updated list of great bluetooth truly wireless earbuds – at the best prices right now It wasn’t long ago that true wireless earbuds, those that don’t need any wires even between the earphones, weren’t very good. Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful.But they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet – once you’ve experienced tangle-free listening, you’ll never go back.Now there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it’s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here’s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff.This  buyer’s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 26 September, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you.Welcome to one of the ’s new buyer’s guides. This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the  may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer\u0027s guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.Nailing the combination of connectivity, sound, in-ear comfort, controls and case size has proved far more difficult for truly wireless earbuds than you might expect. Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try.The Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them.A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause.The Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They’re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there’s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price.Bluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you’re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, inidually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call – something only Apple’s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung’s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you’re on speaker phone.Even the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone.Pairing with an Android phone with Samsung’s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones.The Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don’t like canal-buds.Buy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just workDon’t buy if: you only use iOS or don’t like canal-budsThird time’s the charm for Sony. The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too.The M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes.The sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless.Bluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). Controls are good, but lack volume on the earbud. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements.Battery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They’re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy.Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds yet.Buy if: you want the best sound and great noise cancellingDon’t but if: you want something smaller and more pocket-friendlyIf you don’t like blocking out the world, or can’t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple’s AirPods, now in their second generation.They gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won’t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple’s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.Where they fall down is on-board controls - there’s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There’s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.With the second generation AirPods you can also just say “Hey Siri” at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple’s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.The AirPods’ other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (£40$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android usersBuy if: you use Apple products and don’t need sound isolationDon’t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside worldIf you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible.Available in black or white, they’re light and easy to forget you’re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres.An Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings.Noise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you’re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to.Unusually, there’s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you’ll have to speak up, and there’s no sidetone, so it’s difficult to know how loud you’re talking.Tap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there’s no volume control at all, so you’ll have to reach for your phone for that.They last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk.If you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it.Buy if: you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbudsDon’t buy if: you want a smaller case or better soundIf you wish Apple’s AirPods had better isolation and gripped on to your ear like a vice, look no further than the Beats PowerBeats Pro.Like the AirPods the PowerBeats Pro have great connectivity with an iPhone, which courtesy of the Beats app even extends to Android. Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant.The flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They’re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout just don’t run them under a tap.The silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books.Call quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case.The enormous case is the worst thing about them. It’s robust and works just fine, but you’re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They’re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren’t for you.You want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that’s unshakeable.Buy if: you want rock-solid all-rounders that won’t come off no matter what you doDon’t but if: you want something smaller and cheaperCreative, known for PC soundcards and MP3 players from the 90s and 2000s and now gaming headsets and headphones, produces some of the best value true wireless earbuds around.The Creative Outlier Air (also available in a more expensive “gold” variant) manage to tick almost every box. They’re light and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with a kidney shape that keeps most of the hard plastic body away from the fleshy bits of your ears. A traditional silicone earbud tip holds it in place fairly well, but only two sets are included in the box, meaning you might need to buy some extra ones if it doesn’t make a good enough seal.They have excellent connectivity with Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC and aptX support, can be used independently and best of all last up to 10 hours between trips in the case, which is about double the average battery life of most true wireless earbuds.The case is fairly big, but is light, just about pocketable and holds two full charges of the earbuds, making up to 30 hours before needing to be topped up by USB-C.The Outlier Air sound surprisingly good for the money too, producing well-rounded audio with punch in the bass (once you get a good seal at least) and good clarity in the mids and highs. They won’t touch the best-sounding, but they are a cut above the competition at this price and will even give the likes of the Galaxy Buds and AirPods a run for their money.A button on either bud takes care of playback and volume control, which is a bit stiff, requiring you to grip the bud with your index finger and press the button with your thumb. Press once to pauseplay, twice on the left to skip back or on the right to skip forward. Pressing and holding on the left turns the volume down or on the right turns the volume up.Call quality is surprisingly good, with only a little bit of background noise audible by the recipient while speaking. The earbuds are also IPX5 sweat-proof so fine for a run or similar. Small niggles include poor selection of earbud tips, a slight hiss on pause and hints of lipsync issues with Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.Great sound, connectivity and long battery life, plus solid controls including volume, combine with an OK case to make some excellent value true wireless earbuds.Buy if: you want great-sounding truly wireless earbuds on a budgetDon’t buy if: you want a small case (buy the Anker Liberty Air instead)There are many different types of wireless Bluetooth headphones, but the newest and neatest are the truly wireless earbuds.Unlike neckband earphones or regular Bluetooth earbuds, truly wireless earbuds have no cables connecting between them, freeing the wearer of all cords and cables.Removing all cables means transmitting audio and data between them through your head, which is not an easy task. Many early versions could not maintain a solid connection and therefore had frequent, annoying dropouts.A codec is the system used to transmit the audio signal over the Bluetooth connection which both the phone and headphones must support. There are a variety of codecs available for Bluetooth headphones, with SBC being the default, which is the lowest quality and supported by all Bluetooth audio devices. AAC is an upgrade that most support, with Sony\u0027s LDAC and Qualcomm\u0027s aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency and the newest aptX Adaptive supported by some.Apple\u0027s iPhone notably does not support Bluetooth codecs higher than AAC, but many Android smartphones and newer Bluetooth headphones support at least aptX.Along with variances in audio quality, different codecs have different latency in their transmission of sound. Latency is the time it takes for a sound to be sent to the earphone and be played, which is important because if it is too high the audio track does not match up with video, leading to irritating lipsync issues.Most headphones that only support SBC will have lipsync issues, while AAC and higher can help negate the problem.Some earbuds have the ability to play sounds from the outside world picked up by microphones through the speakers, providing an awareness of what\u0027s happening in the world through the earbuds. Some automatically activate ambient sound on pause, while others can mix it with music or have dedicated modes for listening out for announcements or similar.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEach earbud has to have a battery in it, therefore to squeeze everything into a small enough package to fit in your ear has mean small batteries and fairly short runtimes. But they are not all born equally with some lasting as much as five hours between charges.Short battery life and lack of wires means most truly wireless earbuds come with a charging case with an integrated battery to keep the earbuds safe and topped up. Some charging cases are huge and heavy, others small and light - important to note if you want to carry it in your pocket.Most will have a canal-bud design with an ear tip of varying sizes that enters the ear canal. Alongside the tip many have wings or a body design that is intended to lock into the hollow next to the ear canal called the concha to hold it in place.Here is where the most comfort problems arise, as too much pressure on the soft bits of the ear around the concha will cause pain.These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don’t fit the bill.Anker’s AirPod-like true wireless earbuds are second only to the Creative Outlier Air as the best budget option. They have good but not great sound, solid connectivity and AAC support in a light and comfortable earbud design with stalks.Controls are basic, with no volume control, but call quality is excellent and the case is one of the smaller and easier to pocket variety. You’ll get four hours out of the earbuds and an extra three charges in the case.Anker’s smaller true wireless earbuds are an excellent budget option, but have a larger case and are bettered on sound and call quality by the Liberty Air. They can be found for slightly cheaper and don’t have the AirPod-like stalk design, so are still worth buying if the price or earbud design suits you better. Not good for phone calls though.B\u0026ampO’s second-generation E8 are a solid mix of sound quality and connectivity with a fairly small case. They last just under four hours’ playtime, with two full charges in the case, which itself is charged via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. Touch panels on each earbud take care of controls, including volume, and they have an reasonable transparency mode too. They support AAC, can connect to two devices simultaneously, but can’t be used independently. Call quality is reasonable.The biggest issue is their size: the E8s are massive for earbuds and don’t feel all that stable in your ears unless you use the included Comply foam tips. They’re also expensive and bettered by the Sennheisers on the audio quality front.If you want more isolation than the AirPods but can’t get on with canal-bud style tips, the Bose SoundSport Free provide a good halfway house. The StayHear+ tips rest in your concha but don’t enter your ear canal, holding themselves in-place with a flexible fin.They sound good, connectivity is rock solid with AAC support, call quality is really good, and they last more than four hours between charges. The large case provides two full charges. The biggest problem is that they’re huge and stick out your ear a mile. At least the call quality is good.The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 come very close to delivering on all counts. They have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with AAC and aptX support, long eight-hour battery, good controls including a way to adjust volume and they even sound good, with balanced, rounded audio.The case is also one of the best available, adding up to 36 hours of playback to the earbuds while still being very pocketable, fitting into the money pocket of a pair of jeans long with only a handful of the best.The problem is, they’re huge. They have a really large aperture making getting the earbud tip to fit without blocking your ear canal a bit of a chore and they stick out a mile, looking like something Nichelle Nichols’s Uhura would use in classic Star Trek. The big trunk is uncomfortable in my ears, meaning any 30-minute-plus listening becomes painful. A real shame.The Jabra Elite 65t are a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds. They have rock-solid connectivity, support for AAC, no noticeable lipsync issues and sound good, with punchy, controlled bass plus a full equaliser in the Jabra Sound+ app.There are volumetrack skip buttons on the left earbud and a pauseplay button on the right, which activates ambient sound when double pressed. Call quality is good with clear voice, but background noise bleeds into the mic a little. The case is pretty compact and charges the buds twice totalling to 12 hours’ playback.The Elite 65t twist to lock in place in the ear, but are fairly large and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions for smaller ears.Some of the best true wireless earbuds available, the Track Air+ are narrowly beaten by the Samsung Galaxy Buds for general earbuds on price and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 on noise cancelling.The Libratones have it all: attractive design, rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with aptX support, great sound and even reasonably effective noise cancelling. Add to that a tiny case that’ll fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans just like the Galaxy Buds and AirPods, and has wireless charging. Plus battery life of just shy of six hours and three charges in the case. They’re even sweat resistant.The downsides are lack of volume control on the earbuds, lack of AAC support for an iPhone and an easily marked case. Still, if you wish Apple made noise-cancelling AirPods with silicone earbud tips for a better fit, the Libratone Track Air+ are the ones to buy.If the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless don’t fit the bill but you want great sound, then the Master and Dynamic MW07 are worth a look.They sound good, with pronounced bass and crisp highs, but fall slightly short of the better-sounding Sennheiser. There’s a slight hiss when nothing is playing, but have rock-solid connectivity with AAC and aptX support. The buds are also fairly large and certainly a statement in piano gloss. The wings are a bit uncomfortable, but I didn’t need them.The case is medium sized, and feels good in the hand, but is heavy and the earbuds don’t quite snap into place unless the lid is closed. Physical buttons for controls are great, including volume. Calls sounded echoey.Like black Apple AirPods but with a traditional isolating earbud on the end to enter your ear, the RHA TrueConnect sound good with strong bass and solid isolation, but poor call quality.Connectivity is pretty good including AAC support, with only a very occasional blip while suffering only minimal lipsync issues with video. Latency is more of an issue with games. They last four hours per charge, with four full charges in an attractive, medium-sized case.A button on each earbud handles volume, track skip, pause, play and the voice assistant all accessible with multiple clicks. The button felt mushy on one set requiring replacement.Previously ranked as the best-sounding true wireless earbuds, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless are still great. The earbuds are quite large, but are comfortable with a solid set of earbud tips. They last up to four hours between trips in the case, which itself is one of the better ones, although not quite as pocketable as the best.Connectivity is excellent, supporting Bluetooth 5 with AAC, aptX and the new aptX Low Latency codecs, and no hint of latency issues. Call quality was good but a bit distant. Silver touch pads handle playback and volume control.The best bit is how they sound: rich, lively and warm, with produce crisp highs and deep bass, sounding great with most music genres.The Tranya T3 are a solid set of budget true wireless earbuds with a reasonably bassy sound, good connectivity and AAC support. A button on each earbud takes care of controls. Isolation is fairly weak and the case is pretty bulky and easily marked. Call quality was abysmal and there was a small lipsync issue with YouTube on an iPhone.CrazyBaby Air Nano – Connectivity and latency issues – £70Jabra Elite Sport – Big, bulky and bettered by the newer Jabra Elite 65t – £200Jaybird Run – Solid for runners, but unacceptable latency issues – £159JBL Free X – Large case and terrible latency issues – £120JLabs JBuds Air – Sound fine, but only SDC support means latency issues – £50NuForce BE Free8 – OK sound, but constant hiss and connectivity issues – £200Rowkin Ascent Micro – small, sound OK, but serious latency issues – £125Skullycandy Indy – Sound ok, but get stuck in the case and suffer lag with an iPhone – £70Taotronics BH053 – sound OK, but cheap plastic with questionable durability and lag with YouTube – £38TicPods Free – Good sound and controls, but terrible latency – £120Urbanista Stockholm – AirPod ripoffs with poor fit and weak sound – £89 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

"},{"url":null,"title":"whats the best gaming laptop to replace a macbook air for minecraft","story":"Robert is looking for a laptop that has a keyboard like an old MacBook AirMy son has grown up using a MacBook Air for Minecraft. He swears by the keyboard layout, and having witnessed the blazing speed with which he does things in the game, I understand his reluctance to use his Alienware laptop. (I know, first-world problems, and all that …)Both machines are almost six years old and due a refresh, so I’m looking for a Windows laptop that is powerful enough to run games like Civilization 6 (with mods) but with a keyboard layout that is sufficiently similar to a MacBook that he can continue to use the muscle memory he has built up over the years. Does such a beast exist?One alternative is to buy a MacBook Pro and use it to run Windows (either Bootcamp or Parallels), but the Windows performance strikes me as a compromise (for more money).Budget is a maximum of £1,500. Would be more than happy with cheaper as long as performance wasn’t compromised too much. RobertTake your son to an Apple store or a good computer shop where he can try a MacBook Pro, ideally running Minecraft. In this case, my normal advice – stick with what you know – runs into the problem that what you know no longer exists, unless you buy a second-hand laptop.All Apple’s MacBook Pros now have touch bars instead of function keys, and I agree with Mac fan John Gruber that they have terrible keyboards. Obviously, personal taste is a major factor in keyboard preferences, and I’m sure some people like the “butterfly” keys that have had well-publicised problems. Either way, they are very different from old MacBook Air keyboards.Apple notes that “for some apps, you can make the function keys display permanently in touch bars” by changing the settings in system preferences, so this is something your son should try. However, I expect the new-style keys and touch bars will not map exactly to his “motor memory” so some relearning will be required. (I’ll go into a possible solution later.)If so, he might be prepared to switch to a Windows 10 laptop for Minecraft. Windows is the main platform for serious gaming, and many games – including Minecraft – run better on Windows. Also, he’s young enough to learn to use a Windows keyboard with similar alacrity, which should stand him in good stead for decades to come. Older users can resist change because the relearning period is longer and the payback time is shorter, but that’s a bad strategy for a child.I’m hopeless at Minecraft, and I’ve never played it on a Mac, but the main key functions seem very similar to other games. Normally, you move around using WASD as direction keys, which many people learned playing Quake in 1996. The right hand is best used for a mouse. (Playing action games with a touchpad is one of the punishments used in hell.)WASD, the space bar and USB mouse controls are much the same across all laptops, so I’m not sure where the problems arise.The obvious differences are in the four keys to the left of the space bar, where Windows and MacBook keys have different labels and different functions. For example, Apple has a Command (⌘) key that in most cases works like the Control (Ctrl) key in Windows. However, keys can be remapped to different functions.Ask your son to show you which keys are used differently in Minecraft, and see if you can remap them on the Alienware keyboard. Sharpkeys may do what you need, without the complications of using, say, KbdEdit or AutoHotKey. There are several alternatives.Ideally, you would have two different keyboard layouts that your son can switch at will, using the standard WinKey+Spacebar shortcut.Another idea would be to use an external USB or Bluetooth Apple keyboard with either a MacBook or a Windows 10 laptop. This is better for your son’s long-term health. Put the laptop on a riser, plug in the external keyboard and he will be typing in a more ergonomic position.Getting an Apple keyboard to work with a Windows laptop might be a bit tricky, but whoever ran parkernet (now defunct) created a zip file (AppleProKBD_v2) that enabled an Apple Aluminium Keyboard to work with Windows 7. The file is available from mikecann, where comments say it works with Windows 10.

First, you can get an H-class Intel or AMD Ryzen processor, instead of a U-class designed not to overheat in an over-thin laptop. Second, you can get a dedicated graphics card, which usually makes a big difference with Minecraft. Third, you can get a laptop where not all the parts are soldered in or glued down, so you can upgrade them later.What you can’t get for that sort of money is a very thin gaming laptop with long battery life.If you want to look at other options, Ultrabook Review is keeping a list of laptops with RTX 2060 graphics cards.

I don’t want to call them stupid on television, but there was nothing there to hide. So why Photoshop it? I have no idea.”May denied that the manipulated image was meant to bolster her environment credentials, arguing that paper cups are compostable.“It won’t surprise you to know I never take a plastic drinking water bottle, I carry my own mug, I carry my own utensils on airplanes so I never take a single-use plastic item,” May told reporters. “So it’s bizarre that the notion of fakery should stretch to someone who doesn’t fake anything.”In recent months, plastics have become an environmental touchstone in Canadian politics, after the Liberal government pledged in June to ban single-use plastics, including disposable plates and utensils, by as early as 2021. Shortly afterwards, however, Justin Trudeau was photographed in a meeting with single-use items scattered on the table, and as a result, some politicians have become wary of images that could potentially undercut their environmental credentials.May did, however, have advice for her team in the event they chose to manipulate another image: “If they’re going to Photoshop, couldn’t they do something with my face and make it look a little younger?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa718f964aa6515b236c9290337c244264a2022/0_9_1141_685/master/1141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0db0f773148f805c3de1baec8b15f6c","title":"israels president chooses netanyahu to form government","story":"Reuven Rivlin frustrated after talks between ruling party and opposition stallIsrael’s president has tasked Benjamin Netanyahu with forming a coalition government, throwing a lifeline to the incumbent prime minister after an inconclusive election threatened to end his political career.Reuven Rivlin’s offer does not guarantee Netanyahu will lead Israel’s next administration. Before that can happen, Netanyahu has up to six weeks to forge a majority coalition in Israel’s parliament.“The responsibility for forming the government will be handed to prime minister and Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu,” the president’s office said in a statement.With a ided Knesset, the 69-year-old leader now faces an uphill battle to secure support from at least 61 of 120 lawmakers. If his attempts fail, Rivlin could assign the task to someone else, most likely Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition.That scenario almost played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.Many fear a third election will be called if the stalemate holds.The president had been pushing the two main parties to put aside their differences and form a unity government as together they would have more than enough seats for a majority. Talks appeared to have stalled.Domestic media speculated the Rivlin may have picked Netanyahu as a way of pushing the two to reach an agreement. The president could have waited up to a week to decide but his announcement adds pressure on Netanyahu to make political deals on a deadline or risk losing grip on power.The prime minister has several potential routes to form a government, but many would require lawmakers from rival parties to defect. The clearest path would be to get support from Avigdor Lieberman, whose eight seats afford him a kingmaker status. However, Lieberman, a secular ultranationalist, has refused to sit in a government with religious parties, whose support Netanyahu also depends on.Netayahu’s freedom is also potentially on the line. Next week, pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him are set to begin. If he retains the role of prime minister, he will not be required to step down, even if indicted. Netanyahu has denied all allegations.The central election committee released an official vote tally on Wednesday from last week’s poll that confirmed an inconclusive, razor-thin margin between the two main parties, the ruling Likud and Blue and White.Blue and White was one seat ahead, but neither party had enough support from lawmakers to form a majority coalition. Netanyahu, however, came out narrowly ahead of Gantz when Rivlin asked this week for all parliamentarians to endorse a candidate.There is a precedent in Israel for political rivals to serve together after Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres rotated the role of prime minister in the mid-1980s, each agreeing to serve two years.Yet there was little optimism Gantz and Netanyahu could forge a unity government, as both men have demanded the top seat. Gantz, whose election campaign focused on toppling Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has also repeatedly pledged not to ally with Netanyahu while he faces potential indictments.Further complicating talks, Netanyahu also struck an agreement with rightwing and religious parties that back him to make sure they are part of any future government, something Gantz has sought to avoid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76fc996b2a37d3bab614426216dd1c809c86a3e8/0_0_4575_2746/master/4575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f3ea01701457ab4bedc0c308e516014","title":"tuntiak katan indigenous representative un climate summit","story":"As presidents, prime ministers and corporate executives gathered at the UN climate action summit on Monday, for the first time, an indigenous representative joined the event in a formal capacity.Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people spoke on behalf of the International Indigenous People’s Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC), a caucus of indigenous rights advocates who, for years, has been working towards more robust participation and inclusion at the UN level in response to the climate crisis – even more so after the importance of traditional knowledge was mentioned in the 2015 Paris accord.On Monday, Katan shared the stage with the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the philanthropist Bill Gates in discussing best approaches for adapting to a planet that is heating. “There’s no time left,” said Katan. “We must make a pact for life and for our future.”In his two-minute address, Katan outlined three climate action commitments of the IIPFCC as requested by the UN secretary general. Of these steps, the indigenous rights leader who also serves as vice-president of Coordinator of the Indigenous Organisation of the Amazon River Basin (Coica), emphasized most the need for indigenous inclusion.The address was seen by some as representation that doesn’t go far enough, but in the larger scope of the indigenous rights struggle, it was also seen as a small but significant step towards being seen and heard.Formal indigenous representation has chronically been absent at UN climate talks even though indigenous peoples have been voicing concerns about a warming planet for decades. “The Inuit have been bringing forth warnings about global warming to the international community since the first Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,” said Kuupik Kleist, former prime minister of Greenland, in a statement.But Monday’s summit represented the most visible commitment made by the UN in promoting indigenous inclusion in high-level climate conversations – advanced progress from the historic working group formed at COP24 held in Poland last year.At that gathering, the IIPFCC secured their right for the first time to participate in vital decision-making in how traditional knowledge will be exchanged in adapting to the climate crisis as outlined in paragraph 135 of the Paris agreement.Andrea Carmen, executive director of the International Indian Treaty Council, credits these strides to an increasing number of climate scientists who are turning to traditional knowledge systems as a way to deeper understand the natural world.“Most of the states listening to the scientists are truly scared and are turning to indigenous peoples and saying: ‘Come and sit at the table and tell us what you’re thinking,’” said Carmen.But with UN recognition of these indigenous “ways of knowing”, as Carmen describes them, advocates insist that such acknowledgment must also come with assurances that certain rights, most distinctly spelled out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, are firmly upheld. One provision calls on countries to take effective steps to ensure indigenous knowledge systems are safeguarded so that they can continue to be practiced by the very tribal communities of which they belong.“Our traditional knowledge and the ways that we use it and how we think about it, needs to be respected,” said Carmen, adding that traditional knowledge doesn’t begin and end with the environment but rather the whole relationship indigenous peoples have with the land – economically, socially and culturally.For all the promising gains, though, it was Kayapó tribal leader and 2020 candidate for the Nobel peace prize, Raoni Metuktire of the Amazon, Brazil, who perhaps demonstrated best the need for more indigenous inclusion at the UN level.Raoni was denied access to Monday’s climate summit despite explaining to organizers that own ancestral homelands were still going up in flames – fires blamed on the multinational development logging plans of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro.“Let Raoni in! Protect the Amazon!” shouted his supporters as he stood in the main lobby outside of the UN general assembly.Amazon Watch, one of the leading not-for-profit organizations promoting the protection of the ecosystem, said Raoni was not properly credentialed to attend the summit although he was allowed access to the main UN campus. But Leila Salazar-López, Amazon Watch’s executive director, said given the dire concerns over the rainforest, concessions for his inclusion should have been made.“The Amazon is on fire,” said Salazar-López. “And it’s a result of rolling back environmental laws and the rights of indigenous peoples because of Bolsonaro.“There’s a need to tell world leaders.”“They need us,” said Carmen. “We represent a source that can not only save lives and future generations but maybe also contribute to the shared survival of humanity.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4030408.1569440395!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 70 of cyclists without helmet at time of head trauma","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCycling accounted for all four of the sports and exercise-related deaths recorded at the centre over the period. File photograph: GettyAlmost 70 per cent of cyclists transferred to the State’s main centre for treating brain damage were not wearing helmets at the time they sustained their injury, new research shows.Eighteen of the 26 cyclists sent for treatment to the national neurosurgical centre at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin were not wearing helmets, two were and the status of six patients was unknown, a study of admissions to the centre over a 30-month period shows.Cycling accounted for all four of the sports and exercise-related deaths recorded at the centre over the period. Two of these patients were not wearing helmets, one was and the status of the other mortality was unknown.Two of the dead cyclists are recorded as having fallen off their bicycle, while the other two were knocked off.More than half of all sports and exercise-related referrals to the centre between 2016 and 2018 related to cycling injuries, the figures show. The findings are contained in a paper delivered to European Association of Neurosurgical Societies conference on neurosurgery, taking place in Dublin this week. Cycling accounted for 86 cases referred to the centre for a review, Gaelic football for 30 and horse riding for 23. While only 13 rugby injuries were referred, it accounted for the highest rate of patient transfer, almost half, and five of these six patients required major brain surgery for their injuries.Of the remaining referrals, eight related to hurling, while others involved injuries sustained in soccer, golf, mixed martial arts, tennis and trampolining.‘Risk of skull fracture’“The figures show no sport is immune to head injury, so common sense needs to prevail,” said lead author Dr Phil O’Halloran of Beaumont Hospital. As for the issue of helmet-wearing while cycling, he said “you can’t ignore the numbers. Wearing a helmet won’t stop all serious head injury but it does reduce the risk of skull fracture.”A total of 56 patients, including 30 children, were transferred to the acute neurological unit. Almost 70 per cent were ultimately discharged home. Aside from the four deaths, four patients were transferred out with high-dependency care needs. One of these cases was rugby related, while the other others occurred after a fall from a bicycle and a horse and while hiking.The study was prompted by growing concern over the long-term effect of repeated head injuries on brain function. “The continuing efforts by physicians, therapists, administrators and researchers go a long way to reducing the risk of fatal head injury and are a key factor in ensuring the continued popularity of all contact sports,” said Dr O’Halloran."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Two men injured in single-vehicle incident at Quinpool, Parteen, after midnightGertrude Barrett says on hearing about new inquest she couldn\u0026rsquot \u0026lsquoput feelings into words\u0026rsquoMystery lung disease has affected 530 people in 38 states as bans introduced in some areasWhat graduates should keep in mind to ensure they end up in the right jobVolume of water used is key factor in plucking tiny plastic particles from man-made materialReorganisation plan \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo, Roscommon TD Denis Naughten saysOpposition likely to grow as impact of Garda reorganisation on stations becomes clearResearch based on cyclists transferred to State\u0026rsquos main centre for treating brain injuryDelivery of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy bridge over Barrow delayed \u0026lsquoby several weeks\u0026rsquoKim Martin\u0026rsquos fiancee, who he was to marry in August, appeals for help to get him homeResearch Lives: Prof Yvonne Buckley, professor of zoology at Trinity College DublinVictim strangled or otherwise made unable to breath in a quarter of cases, study showsMigrant workers provide up to 12pc of global GDP, Michael D Higgins points outStudents who turn 18 while in asylum process should not face \u0026lsquoblunt categorisation\u0026rsquoSkeletal remains could link neolithic builders and Irish people alive todayWhat you need to bear in mind to make sure you end up in the best possible working environment\u0026lsquoAll the stuff we\u0026rsquove gone through for the truth.

While remediation work did not stop main construction work from progressing, the spokesman said that fixing the issue had led to a delay of “weeks, not months”.The council argued that “non-conformances of this nature are not untypical on a structure of this complexity”.Joint ventureThe project is a public-private partnership (PPP) with a joint venture of BAM Civil Construction and Spanish builder Dragados responsible for construction. A spokesman for BAM said the company was contractually precluded from discussing the project.The bridge was initially scheduled to open early this year, but construction complexities unrelated to the issue around the piers have led to delays. It is thought the bridge is now likely to open towards the end of this year or early next year.Challenging weather conditions during the winter may present another hurdle to completion of the project, Wexford County Council said in a statement.“Wexford County Council remains hopeful that the project will open before the end of the year, but also recognises that the timeline is challenging and is subject to an ongoing review. We are conscious that there is a growing anticipation of the opening and that a lot of people in the New Ross area and beyond have waited a long time to see this project come to fruition.”The bridge, which is one of the longest of its construction type in the world, is named after the mother of former US president John F Kennedy, whose ancestors came from the New Ross area.“The project stakeholders are working to ensure that the project is completed safely and opened at the earliest opportunity to realise the benefits that the project will brign to New Ross and the wider region,” the spokesman added."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.The legal documents say that, by contrast, Ms Morales runs a “small business” with just a “handful of employees”, a small online presence and poorly subscribed social media accounts.“The Opposition, which claims that consumers are likely to be confused between a boutique wedding event planning business and Blue Ivy Carter, the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world, is frivolous and should be refused in its entirety,” the court documents add.Beyonce recently collaborated with her daughter on her Lion King soundtrack album The Gift, which made Blue Ivy the youngest female artist in history to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\u0026nbspBlue Ivy frequently appears with her parents at prestigious events, including the 2019 Grammy Awards and the world premiere of The Lion King.\u0026nbspBeyonce and Jay-Z are also parents to two-year-old twins Rumi and Sir Carter.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But each app must ensure they actually turn it on, or they will just look as they always do.Instagram has not yet done that. It means that users scrolling through their otherwise dark phone can open Instagram and be suddenly hit by a blazing light white design, which can be especially painful when scrolling at night.Twitter is full of users requesting that Instagram finally add the feature, comparing opening Instagram to having the curtains pulled open after sitting in the dark.Now Instagram appears to be finally testing it out, giving some people access to a dark mode that will automatically switch on if a phone has the setting turned on in their phone\u0027s options.The dark mode appears to leave the rest of the design largely similar. The colours of the app remain unchanged, and photographs look no different Instagram\u0027s dark mode simply swaps the bright white that is usually behind posts and stories and swaps it for a much darker colour.To get the update, users need to be on the latest version of iOS and Android as wel as the latest version of Instagram, as well as having the dark mode option chosen in the system\u0027s settings. But not everyone in that position appears to be able to get access to it, with the test rolling out gradually.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was first spotted some weeks ago by an amateur astronomer, but has now\u0026nbspbeen given an official designation by the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union.The 2I in its name refers to the fact that it is the second known interstellar visitor. Borisov is the name of the Russian amateur astronomer who first spotted it, and began the hunt for more information about our new visitor.It had previously been known as\u0026nbspC2019 Q4 but got its new name after being officially confirmed by the IAU, which is responsible for naming and cataloguing objects in space.The object is\u0026nbspthe first comet known to have arrived in our solar system. The first confirmed object, named Oumuamua, still remains largely mysterious – with astronomers still uncertain about what it even is, let alone where it came from or how it got here.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Its journey means that it will be nearby for much longer, giving astronomers a chance to observe it more fully and hopefully understand more of its story.Scientists perplexed by mysterious alien space rock2IBorisov\u0026nbspwas first seen at the end of August by\u0026nbspGennady\u0026nbspBorisov, from Crimea. He noticed that it appeared to be a comet, based on the haze that surrounded it, and he turned out to be right\u0026nbsp– since comets tend to be named after the person who first spotted them, it was given his name.That distinctive tail is helping astronomers understand more about how the comet is making its way through the universe. Its current orbit suggests that it will be flying around the solar system for months, coming close to the Sun on 7 December and then flying out of the solar system.During that time, astronomers are scanning the visitor to learn as much as they can about it. That could help illuminate its origin and its destination, more about what it is made of, and how it could have been sent all the way to us – questions that could not be fully answered about Oumuamua, since it was spotted so late and was already heading out of the solar system before researchers could turn their attention to it fully.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I suspect the Neolithic ones were used for the same purpose but we can’t confirm that until we’ve examined them,” said Dr Dunne.\u0026nbspWeaning a child earlier using animal milk could have helped counteract a period of infertility that can happen when a mother breastfeeds.\u0026nbspHunter-gatherers were having children about once every five years yet early agriculturalists were probably having them every couple of years.\u0026nbspScientists believe\u0026nbspthese little vessels could help explain why there was a ‘baby boom’ during the Neolithic period.Seidl da Fonseca)Dr Dunne said: “Humans become agriculturalists and they start growing cereals. Once people are settled and they’ve got food on tap to feed babies they start having more babies and more often. Fertility increases which then leads to a baby boom and a massive increase in the population.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The items were found next to children between zero and six years old.\u0026nbspEach one was between five and 10cm across and had an extremely narrow spout that fitted inside the baby’s mouth. Because the spouts are so small it has been difficult to determine what they contained and before analysing them researchers thought they could have been used to nourish sick adults or the elderly.\u0026nbspExpert reconstructs face of 4,000-year-old Neolithic dogTo understand what was inside them researchers did a chemical analysis on the fatty acids from animal products. They found two of the vessels had been used for milk from a ruminant animal (cattle, sheep or goats) whereas the other was non-ruminant milk (probably from a pig or human).The study, published in Nature, is the first research to look at how infants were weaned in these prehistoric cultures. Similar vessels have been found in ancient Rome and Greece and researchers would now like to investigate whether they served the same purpose. \u0026nbspScientists say the study provides a crucial insight into the diet of children in prehistoric human populations.\u0026nbsp“Bringing up babies in prehistory was not an easy task. We are interested in researching cultural practices of mothering, which had profound implications for the survival of babies,” said researcher Dr Katharina Rebay-Salisbury from the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.“It is fascinating to be able to see, for the first time, which foods these vessels contained,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unchecked, they could break into the Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta in central California, which provides drinking water for some 10 million people, as well as irrigation and flood protection.“It sounds ridiculous, but these swamp rats are actually a major problem for our water infrastructure. They can cause floods by destroying irrigation canals and levees,” said Democratic congressman Josh Harder earlier this year.Now, armed with $10m (£8m)\u0026nbspin state funds, rangers are deploying new tactics to eradicate the nutria and try to prevent the widespread destruction they are known to cause.“Over the past two years, our best efforts were trying to not even control the population but keep it from exploding while we pursued the resources needed to actually pursue eradication,” said Valerie Cook, from the California fish and wildlife department’s eradication programme.“We haven’t had nutria in California for 50 years, so nobody really knows much about them,” Peter Tira, a department spokesman,\u0026nbspsaid. “We’ve had to learn on the job as we go.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The area is the US’ most productive agricultural region, responsible for more than half its\u0026nbspfruit, vegetables and nuts, including almost all apricots, table grapes, carrots, asparagus and tree nuts.Damage to the region, whose output was estimated in government figures to have been $29bn (£23bn) in 2017, would be disastrous for its economy and diet.“It would mean no more sushi, because the alternative would be to buy rice from Japan or Korea, where the price is five times higher,” said Daniel Sumner, director of the Agricultural Issues Centre\u0026nbspat the University of California-Davis. “Kiss off carrots, or live without table grapes in the summertime.”Additional reporting by Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The scale of the fraud eventually led the committee overseeing the area’s redevelopment to lodge a criminal complaint.“Faking marriages and orces to...illegally acquire more relocation compensation constitutes the crime of fraud,” Liu Chen, the police officer leading the investigation.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu’s\u0026nbspparty won 32 seats.\u0026nbspBut the incumbent prime minister secured the backing of more lawmakers than\u0026nbsphis rival, albeit with equally tight margins, with Mr Gantz\u0026nbspsecuring 54 and Mr Netanyahu\u0026nbspsecuring 55.The question now is whether the prime minister will be able to form a coalition, or whether the deep isions between Israel’s political parties will force another election, which would be the third in just one year.The president has impressed upon both sides that an election should be avoided at all costs, telling both men: “People expect you to find a solution and to prevent further elections, even if it comes at a personal and even ideological cost.”Mr Gantz’s party said that while they were\u0026nbsp“committed to the principle of unity” they could not enter into government if Mr Netanyahu is kept as leader, as he faces indictment in three corruption cases next month.Mr Gantz added: “Blue and White, led by me, does not agree to sit in a government whose leader is facing a severe indictment.\u0026nbsp This issue, among a number of other critical factors, is more important to us than any delegation of ministerial posts or a rotation.”Mr Netanyahu, who\u0026nbsphas signed a deal with smaller allies including ultra-Orthodox parties, will struggle to form a coalition.\u0026nbspFormer ally\u0026nbspAvigdor Lieberman\u0026nbspcriticised Mr Netanyahu and urged him to be more flexible in talks. He won eight\u0026nbspseats in the election but has so far refused to join either side.\u0026nbspThe ex-defence minister and now head of the\u0026nbspultranationalist\u0026nbspYisrael\u0026nbspBeiteinu\u0026nbspparty had called for a secular unity government that excluded the prime minister’s religious allies, a demand Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu\u0026nbsphas rejected.\u0026nbspPresident Rivlin meanwhile added in his statement that he had offered several suggestions to help with the “legal complications” the country faced, in a veiled reference to Mr Netanyahu’s likely court proceedings.He suggested the appointment of an interim prime minister who would take over if the premier was “unable to fulfil his role”, it also added that the law could be amended to put a 100-day limit on the prime minister’s leave of absence.Tamara Wittes, senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings, told The Independent that the question will now be how strongly the various political parties will hold on to their campaign principles.“Lieberman said he will only join a unity government with the two major parties. Does he mean it, or might Netanyahu be able to entice him back into a right-wing coalition? Blue and White said they would not sit in a government with Likud headed by Netanyahu — will they really insist on his departure as the price of unity, even if it means a third election?”, she said.\u0026nbsp“The Likud MKs and all the parties to its right swore loyalty to Bibi as the head of their bloc. Do they mean it, or will they be willing to throw him over to avoid a third election? These are the questions.“Gantz seems to be banking on Lieberman holding his ground, meaning Bibi will fail to form a government of the right and will have to come to Gantz hat in hand. We shall see if that bet pays off.”Blue and White Party\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I cant rememberTyrone or she mentioned that she was dating a footballer.She mentioned she was upset with the way she was treated by him. She wanted to expose him to his missus or something like that.We discussed what she could do. She had a few options. I mentioned to her she could sell it to newspapers.Rowe said the plan was to take incriminating footage of Wood with the footballer in the hotel room.He added: Basically we would enter the room, get a recording of the footballer and Natalie in a compromising position and then leave.I was sceptical about the whole thing. I was actually surprised when I entered the room and saw it was actually the footballer.Rowe said he asked Tyrone Coleman to send him the video so he could show it to friends who had contacts with the media.He claimed he was handed the footballers tracksuit by Wood after they left the hotel room and said he later found a £, Rolex watch and wallet inside it.I just panicked, he said. I didnt want to get myself into trouble or anyone  into trouble.Under cross-examination, Rowe said they wanted to sell the story to The Sun but did not know how much it would be worth to the newspaper.Simon Jones, prosecuting, suggested: The reality is you knew you could earn big money from . Thats why you were going to go to the media You are motivated by money Rowe, who said he owned a vape shop and did not need the money, replied: To a certain extent.He insisted the tracksuit, which still had tags on, was handed to him by Wood who told him she had purchased it for the footballer.Rowe said: I was never going to keep the Rolex, I was going toit.Rowe also said it had never crossed my mind about whether the footballer would be wealthy.Mr Jones said: The truth, I suggest, is that you came up with the idea to get an image of him and use that image to sell to the newspaper and what you were going on to discuss with Tyrone and Nathan was how you could threaten him.If you were in the room and filming him and had footage on a mobile phone, you could demand there and then the money to keep you quiet.This is all part of a very detailed blackmail plot, was it not Rowe replied: No, not at all.I was planning to exposeto the media and expose him to his missus.The jury of nine women and three men has heard a police investigation was launched after the footballer ran into a nearby restaurant in his underwear.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"zoo reopens new animals charity cash close down","story":"Rafah Zoo in Gaza was slammed after disturbing pictures revealed dozens of emaciated lions, monkeys, and peacocks living in cramped cages.The zoo agreed to close and accepted more than £, from Vienna-based animal charity Four Paws to pay for food and medical treatment until the animals could be moved.In April, the animals were sedated and moved  miles to a new home in Jordan via Israel, which gave special permission for the land transfer.But the zoo is now reported to have reopened and keeping lions, ostriches, and monkeys, again in tiny cages.Four Paws hit out at the development and received assurances from the zoo owners that it would close once the transfer of animals had been completed.Martin Bauer, a spokesperson for the charity, told Central European News: Of course we are disappointed that it has reopened after promising to close, and it now rests in the hands of local authorities to act because, as far as we know, the newly opened zoo has no licence.Of course,local officials confiscate the animals, we would be prepared to enter into talks about assisting in their rescue and relocating in a more species-appropriate habitat.But we need to move away from the circle of paying each time to rescue the animals in a kind of hostage situation.Of the lions now being kept in the zoo, two are fully-grown and three are cubs.Recent visitors to the zoo report seeing staff trying to separate lion cubs from their mothers users sticks so that customers could be photographed with them.They also said ostriches were being kept in tiny cages and were constantly pecking at their bars, and that monkeys could be seen eating rubbish off the floor.New manager Ashraf Jumaa, who is thought to be related to the people who promised to close the zoo, denied the zoo was trying to blackmail charities for more money.Our main objective is not trade but entertainment, and we decided to reopen because that was what local people wanted, he said.But he admitted that the zoo would be unable to afford to feed all its lions once the cubs began to grow.He said the fully-grown lions would need -kg of meat a day, which they would not be able to cover given current visitor numbers.Gaza continues to suffer economically under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by Israel after militant organisation Hamas took control of the strip in .Around half of Gazas two million people are estimated to live below the poverty line.A spokesman for the Gaza agriculture ministry said they had not discussed the reopening with anyone at the zoo, and that there was little likelihood the necessary land could be made available for a zoo to meet international standards.Four Paws has said that the current cages sizes are completely unacceptable and that the animals were in need of better food and medical care.Local animal rights activist Mohammed Aweda cast doubt on the prospect of a further rescue, saying there was already a debate about whether the last payment should be counted as animal trading."},{"url":null,"title":"affinity water declared drought britains wettest day","story":"As forecasters issued a “danger to le” warning due to flash floods, Affinity Water even threatened

The least we can do is take care of those they leave behind.These failings are immoral and they are a direct assault on military effectiveness and therefore the defence of our country.Why  Because they corrode the morale of our servicemen and women.However many ultra-sophisticated aircraft carriers, F combat fighters, tanks and missiles we supply, the morale of the fighting man will always remain the cornerstone of combat power.High morale achieves miracles in battle, low morale leads to disaster and defeat.Low morale also makes people vote with their feet, signing off for civilian jobs where they will be properly looked after.This helps explain the woeful undermanning in the forces today, where recruiting has failed miserably to keep up with outflow.Yet a government that hopes to plug the gaping hole by increasing recruitment of soldiers from the Commonwealth shoots itself in both feet. It has made it virtually impossible for many recruits to be joined here by their families due to petty bureaucracy that could be overcome at a stroke.The Sun’s Never Forget Them campaign led the Government in July to create an Office for Veterans’ Affairs, with direct access to the Cabinet, with a new minister for Defence People and Veterans heading it.At the same time the PM promised the Government would: “Do all it can to support our Armed Forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.”No one expects overnight transformation.But after two months we have not heard one single new idea on tackling all of these age-old problems from the minister, Johnny Mercer.Mr Mercer is no ordinary politician. He’s a distinguished and courageous former soldier who fought in Afghanistan during three tours of duty and a man who I and many veterans admire and respect.He went “on strike” during Theresa May’s premiership in protest at the prosecution of British troops over historical allegations from the Northern Ireland campaign.Yet only last week we witnessed the opening of a murder trial against an elderly former soldier for alleged crimes in Londonderry half a century ago.Mr Mercer could not have done anything to prevent this.But he has not explained to the public how he intends to halt the disgraceful hounding of veterans through the courts in what is the greatest betrayal of their own Armed Forces by any government in history.In response to the Defence Committee report Mr Mercer tweeted: “I will offer a private informal session to the committee and update on every single issue raised.”Such discretion would be the way of a soldier but it is not what we expect from political leaders.The British public, as well as serving soldiers and veterans, are outraged by the abuse of our troops and those who have served.What we demand is to be told about solutions that will be actioned as soon as possible.Mr Mercer has experience of the issues raised in the latest report and served on the Defence Committee.Since entering Parliament in  he has campaigned energetically to sort out the plight of both servicemen and veterans, describing it as his main mission.If he was new to the forces’ problems we could understand he might need time to gain understanding and consider possible options.But he was selected because he has a deep understanding and experience and should have been able to announce his programme on day one.I worked at the centre of government for years and know the quagmire that confronts a minister trying to fight through a bureaucracy resistant to change and adept at wielding the civil service machinery that exists to frustrate progress.But Mr Mercer must find the resolve to overcome these obstacles. He should adopt Churchill’s dictum of “action this day”.There is no time for private briefings, blusterings and paralysis.Our troops are deployed on operations around the globe today. And who knows when the next intense battle will begin, whether over Russian expansion, Iranian aggression, or Chinese provocation, or something totally unforeseen We expect our fighting men and women to lay down their livesnecessary.It is vital that the Government and Mr Mercer do everything they can totheir courage and dedication in deeds as well as words.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While a large percentage of the younger generation are genuinely concerned about the planet — and rightly so — how many of them are actually going to do their bit beyond the enviable opportunity to skip school on a sunny day and virtue signal with a hand-made banner Deliciously tempting though it may be to blame their parents, the simple truth is that up to  years ago, no one had even heard of climate change.Far from worrying about the planet heating up, I distinctly remember our geography teacher telling us that a mini ice age was coming.In the meantime, I walked or cycled to school every day, wore jumpers indoors in winter because we didn’t have central heating and baked in the stling heat of the summer of ’ in classrooms without the luxury of air-con.There were no ready meals, we ate simple food cooked by mothers who had grown up with rationing, the vast supermarkets of today didn’t exist and we didn’t have a freezer.The only “takeaway” in easy reach was a fish and chip shop and the first time we ever ate out was when I scraped a couple of O-level passes and my mum took me to the local Berni Inn to celebrate.Our milk came in glass bottles, we ate locally grown, seasonal fruit and vegetablesand I didn’t set eyes on an avocado or any other exotic foodstuff until well into adulthood.At school, I was taught to mend things, not throw them away, would wear something several times before my mother would even think about washing it, and only received new clothesat Christmas or on birthdays.We had one TV, didn’t even get a landline until I was and I didn’t go abroad until I was  — by boat, not plane.No one went on “a gap yah” and my mum would have killed meI left our tent at Glastonbury, because we used it for holidays in Wales.I could go on, but the younger generation’s collective eye-roll of boredom might cause a damaging tremor.Suffice to say,today’s kids are happy to strip their lives back to reflect the childhood we had, it would be a great step towards helping the planet. But it’s not going to happen.So, instead of the lame, “old people have ruined everything for young people”, mantra, all generations should be working together to not only do their bit at homebut to continue putting pressure on those who govern us and have the power to effect realistic, not idealistic, change for a planet that currently accommodates seven and a half billion people.Then the admirable young Greta can go back to school and get on with having a normal le.THE Duchess of Sussex has learned the hard way that making inclusive speeches and appearing accessible has its pitfalls.In other words, someone might ask you to dance.

respected BBC commentator Mark Lawson has pointed out the show, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, has become outlandish and ­unsustainable on account of the ludicrous number of rape victims and murderers.And that’s before you even start trying to calculate the number of Walford characters who’ve been abducted.Personally, though, I don’t ­remember a time when EastEnders was anything other than the most deranged show on television.I would’ve thought more obvious signs it had lost the plot would be Ben Mitchell’s six ­dferent heads, Phil Mitchell’s ­people smuggling operation with Barry Grant off Brookside and the surprisingly high number of ­characters who revealed they were gay in time for the opening of the show’s new LGBT bar.Which has to be the happiest ­EastEnders coincidence since The Queen Vic organised a “European night,” not long after the Brexit vote.It’s good to have your prejudices ­questioned, though, so I watched with added care last week to seeI’d been missing a trick, as the Square came to terms with the bloody aftermath of the pub siege.Hunter’s still dead, thankfully, but Keanu’s made a remarkable recovery from being shot at point blank range and Bex is up for something called a “Pride of Walford award.” The real focus of the drama, however, was Bobby Beale, who’s freshly released from prison and so traumatised he’s prone to taking drugs and wandering off into train tunnels.As would youyou’d killed your sister and undergone four head transplants.The cure for all this ­torment is classic EastEnders and actually a bit easier to believe than the idea Ian Beale’s new lodger is Rainie, the ­prostitute he had sex with the night daughter Lucy was killed.Bobby’s embraced Islam.He says: “It helps me see the good in people.”The show says it is “to counter negative representations of Islam.”No word on why these representations might be negative, of course, just as EastEnders never had any dramatic response or even a mention of ­Islamist terror attacks in London or three East End schoolgirls running away to join IS.Bobby’s story exists in a soap vacuum.It’s a no-context approach that treats the viewers as dangerous idiots, of course, but wouldn’t grate quite so much­EastEnders had a blanket approach to all religions.It doesn’t, though. Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save.

But Mr Shapps insisted that Turkey made no approach and the travel firm was “not viable” by the time Spain made its offer. The TSSA union’s Manuel Cortes said: “The public deserves to know whether our Government was negligent in not acting to safeguard Thomas Cook.”Court documents filed this week show the firm had a deficit of £billion – with £.billion of debt and nearly £million owed to suppliers. It had £million in the bank. Swiss chief executive Peter Fankhauser, , concluded in the documents that the firm would “run out of cash” by October  “andprobably earlier”. He and other ex-bosses were criticised after directors were revealed to have shared £million in pay andperks since .Mr Shapps said an Insolvency Service probe would look at the role of directors and had powers to recoup bonuses.

She  told the House of Commons: Earlier today parents in Walthamstow contacted extremely concerned about the content of a presentation about the prime minister’s proposals and Brexit.

Boris Johnson responded by saying: Obviously the honourable lady is bringing me news about the schools in her constituency. What I can tell her is that we’re investing more in every primary school in this country. The Mirror understands several parents sounded the alarm after the clip appeared yesterday on an outdoor digital noticeboard at a school in her Walthamstow constituency. The noticeboards are thought to be run by a company called Anomaly Ltd and usually show non-political information such as healthy eating tips.

Erdmanis, from Birmingham, was described as being completely out of it.    He befriended another person on the aircraft who appeared to be drunk as well, prosecutor Steven Woodman said. The female passenger and a male passenger with her heard them making a number of comments about females on board. He was asked to place the bottle of vodka in the overhead compartment but he said he would not. The couple sat beside Erdmanis complained to staff about the comments he and another man were making. They were shocked when he shouted you snitch at them before unleashing a volley of slurs. The cabin crew asked the pairthey were ok and they were moved to another part of the plane, the prosecutor added. The passenger said she welled up because she was so angry and frustrated at having to put up with that behaviour. The cabin crew asked the pilot to call for the police on arrival at Manchester Airport. Erdmanis, who is currently unemployed, and the other male were both arrested as the plane landed.    Police recorded that he smelt heavily of intoxicant and was very unsteady on his feet. He explained to officers that he did not know that being drunk on a plane was illegal before admitting having had half a bottle of vodka. Defending, Peter Broderick said his client made full admissions at interview and was not the more rowdy of the two males. This was an unsavoury incident and it is not a nice thing for sober passengers to be around, the lawyer said. He was in Budapest with his friends to see a pop concert. He was drunk when he got on the plane and had a bottle of vodka which he was drinking on the plane. To his credit he is a gentleman with no previous criminal record. I would submit that the unsavoury comments were made by the other party and not this defendant.

Mr Keedwell appeared before Worcester Magistratesapos Court four times and took the case to Worcester Crown Court on appeal last month. Unfortunately for the pensioner the judge ruled in favour of the Crown Prosecution Service. In making sure his case got a fair hearing Mr Keedwell forked out £, on barristeraposs fees and £, in court costs, on top of travel costs. Mr Farrow, who was his key witness, failed to convince the judge with the Double Doppler defence.    The district judge who presided over the magistrates’ court trial offended Mr Keedwell with the comment: “Why is my time being wasted with this ” Mr Keedwell said: “I was quietly appalled. What chance have ordinary people like me got with a legal system like that  “I was thinking already, ‘I wonder how much it will cost to go to Crown Court.’” Despite losing thousands of pounds that, Mr Keedwell said, would have been inherited by his  and -year-old children, the figure that particularly irked him was the £ victim surcharge. He said:  “That was a joke. Who was the victim ” “Theystill live at home because they cannot afford their own houses,” he added.    “The eldest is like, ‘Why do you bloody bother ’ My we has a degree of frustration. “But on the other hand, she knows it’s my money. She’s aware there is more to this than a simple speeding case. “The money would probably have gone to our sons, or some of it maybe to the donkey’s home because my we loves animals – unfortunately itaposs now in the pockets of the law.” Fortunately for his sons, they will still inherit the family home and Mr Keedwell is still comfortable. When asked where he got his spirit from, he said: God knows where it comes from.

Thandeka took to Archie immediately, and she later joked that he was going to be a ladies man. The Royal Family are known for using nicknames when speaking to each other, and there are some weird and wonderful ones they use. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a number of sweet names for their kids, including Tips for George.    The name apparently started at PG - for Prince George - and they then started comparing it to the teabags. In the end, they dropped the PG bit. William has a much fancier name for Charlotte though, and he was heard calling her Mignonette when they played in a garden Kate designed at the Cha Flower Show. The French word means small, sweet, and delicate or cute. Older French definitions also show it can mean gentle and kind. But some of the Familyaposs names arenapost quite as cute and flattering.    While the royal kids call the Queen Gan-Gan, her husband Prince Philip has a few bizarre alternatives to Elizabeth. Apparently the main nickname he uses for the love of his le is Lilibet , but he also occasionally calls her Sausage . However possibly the strangest nickname for the Queen is Gary , and sheaposs got Prince William to thank for it.

A robber punched, kicked and threw -year-old Lauren Reece Flay to the ground while she was on her way to work. The robber set upon her in the town of Hessle, in Hull, moments after she left its train station on the night of Friday, September .She was ragged around by her attacker before he made off with her phone and a small amount of cash, reports Hull Live .But Lauren, of north Hull, soon received the most devastating news from doctors when they told her she had miscarried the day after the robbery - and just days after finding out she was pregnant.    She said: “I was only literally early on pregnant. We only found out within that week. “When the ambulance first came I didn’t have any stomach pain. I just wanted to go home to my son and be in my own kind of place. “But then on the Saturday I started to have a few pains. When they told me I kind of knew straight away. “I was shocked but expected it. “It is s**t to be honest. I was excited about it. I told my sister and my friends that it was something I was really looking forward to.” The man who carried out the robbery was described as white, in his s, of slim build, wearing a black Northface jacket, grey joggers and a black baseball cap.    Lauren, who has an -month-old son, says she saw her attacker before she stepped onto the Hull to Sheffield bound train at Hull Paragon. She said: “I always get the .pm train and on this evening there was a man in his early twenties acting strange but I didn’t think too much into it. “I just thought it’s a Friday night and he might be on something and I didn’t take too much interest. “When the train was going he was walking up and down the aisle and that was when I was starting to feel a little worried. “He then sat at my table and kept staring at me. He answered his phone and was talking to a mate and it sounded like he was going to Sheffield. “As the train was stopping at Hessle I was at the door and he then got up to get off which I thought was strange as I thought he was getting off at Sheffield. “He then tried to get off the train on the other side where the tracks were, so I told him ‘youaposve got to get off this side, you don’t want to end up dead’.” As Lauren stepped off the train she began to “dawdle” her way to work, hoping that the strange man would bypass her on the bridge at the station – but he didn’t. Lauren kept walking along Southfield when she was then punched and grabbed by her alleged attacker and “ragged” around.    She said: “He never went past me so straight away I thought it was a bit strange. “I carried on walking and went to put my headphones in and then the next thing I knew he punched me in the chest and then again and then ragged me around. “He even kicked me in the legs”. Lauren suffered two fractured ribs on her left side and bruising to her chest. She had no phone so made her way to work for help before she was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. The next day, she was told she had suffered a miscarriage. Another man is said to have walked ahead of Lauren and her attacker as they got off the train who she thinks might be able to help. She said: “There was another male who was in front of us but he was walking at normal pace. “The way the man ran after the attack was in the same direction as that other man so I thought maybe he passed him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"three bed terrace market just","story":"NewsThree-bed home on the market for just £ - but its a house of horrors insidePictures show the horrendous condition of the Victorian property in Birmingham, which appears to have all the right features - until you step insideShareCommentsByJack EvansJoseph Wilkes:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video sdl-auctions-auction-three-bedroom-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news three-bed-terrace-market-just-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

While another simply said sarcastically: Thanks for ruining my holiday. Other messages which may have been meant as pranks include Mate, canapost believe you let all the lads down the way you did and Thanks for nothing fella. Mr Cook says he has found it all rather amusing, but does consider it harassment.    He said: Obviously being called Thomas Cook has always been a rather funny joke and Iaposve always been the butt of constant jokes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe worldaposs first aposbaby bottleapos used by our Bronze Age ancestors more than , years ago has been unveiled by scientists. The clay container was used to feed an infant fresh milk from cows, goats or sheep - up to , years ago. And it could mean that other vessels up to , years ago in Neolithic times were also used as baby bottles, though there is no definite proof for this. The Bronze Age vessel had a two inch wide bowl with an extremely narrow spout through which the liquid could be poured. It was found in a Bronze Age tomb in Baia, southern Germany - buried with the cremated remains of the one to two year old child. A chemical analysis of lipid residues found it contained traces of milk from domesticated animals. The specic species could not be identied. Two similar vessels discovered in the graves of infants at a nearby Iron Age cemetery dating back , to , years also had fatty-acids from ruminants. The discovery will prompt anthropologists to re-evaluate the way that humans have evolved over the centuries.    It had been presumed prehistoric babies were fed in their early months or years with breast milk provided by mother. The assumption ties in with the belief during the primitive hunter-gather era, mums stayed in mud huts feeding infants while dads went out into the wilderness in search of prey. These stereotypical roles were thought to have held firm until modern times when the invention of baby bottles, powdered milk and other innovations allowed women to be liberated from domestic duties. Lead author Dr Julie Dunne, of the University of Bristol, said: These very small, evocative, vessels give us valuable information on how and what babies were fed thousands of years ago, providing a real connection to mothers and infants in the past. The foods used to supplement or replace breast milk in babiesapos diets in prehistoric times had been a mystery. It is believed humans first started drinking animal milk in Europe. Earlier this year a study of dental plaque showed Stone Age cavemen consumed it , years ago. Now Dr Dunne and colleagues present the earliest known evidence of animal milk in small aposbottlesapos for babies. The study published in Nature sheds light on the infant weaning practices of prehistoric human groups. Pottery vessels with spouts through which liquid could be poured have been found dating back to Neolithic times, more than , years ago. They are usually small enough to fit within a babyaposs hands and have a spout through which liquid could be suckled.   Sometimes they have feet and are shaped like imaginary animals - such as a pig. It had been suggested they were to help feed the sick or infirm. But the three obviously specialised vessels in child graves - combined with the chemical evidence - suggests they were used to feed animal milk to babies, say the researchers. This would either be in place of human milk or during weaning onto supplementary foods. The only previous evidence for weaning came from isotopic analysis of infant skeletons. But this could only give rough guidelines of when children were weaned, not what they were eating or drinking. Dr Dunne said: This evidence of the foodstuffs that were used to either feed or wean prehistoric infants confirms the importance of milk from domesticated animals for these early communities, and provides information on the infant-feeding behaviours that were practised by prehistoric human groups.It is the first study of its kind, opening the way for investigations of feeding vessels from other ancient cultures worldwide.Dr Dunne said: Similar vessels, although rare, do appear in other prehistoric cultures - such as Rome and ancient Greece - across the world.Ideally, weaposd like to carry out a larger geographic study and investigate whether they served the same purpose. Breastfeeding is integral to infant care in all human groups and fundamental to the mother-infant relationship.  It provides an infant with the nutrients required to sustain growth for the first six months of le, protects against bugs and boosts development of the immune system. Dr Dunne said: The introduction of energy and nutrient-rich, easily digestible, supplementary foods in infant feeding - that is, during weaning - is unique to humans. Supplementary foods are generally introduced at around six months of age, when the metabolic requirements of an infant exceed the energy yield that the mother can provide through milk, contributing to the infant diet as chewing, tasting and digestive competencies develop. She pointed out animal milk contains more carbohydrates, in the form of lactose, and much less protein. Furthermore, feeding it unpasteurised comes with a risk of contamination and transmission of animal diseases, as well as bacterial contamination from the vessel. Added Dr Dunne: Notwithstanding these obvious risks, our discovery of ruminant-milk-based foods in these prehistoric baby bottles offers a rare glimpse into the ways prehistoric families were attempting to deal with the challenges of infant nutrition and weaning at this inherently risky phase of the human le cycle.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

of the British Legion is being wound up due to an ageing membership and lack of replacement post-holders.Outside Peebles Parish Church on Sunday the branchs Colours were paraded one last time by Standard Bearers David Watson and Herbert Fergusson ahead of a hand-over ceremony.As the stanzas of Binyons moving For the Fallen still echoed around the Parish Church, orated by George Gilchrist, the standards were piped up the aisles and presented to the Lord Lieutenant of Tweeddale, Sir Hew Strachan.The Reverend Pamela Strachan, who was deputising for the Rev Calum Macdougall, accepted the Colours from her husband in the Chancel on behalf of the Church.The Peebles branchs Colours will now rest permanently above the WW Memorials, and close to the North and South aisles.Pamela told us: \"As Calum, who is recovering from surgery, was instrumental in the early preparations for the ceremony he was disappointed not to be present for the event.\"However, the complete final organisation and implementation of this special service was carried out impeccably by all involved.\"The Royal British Legion Standards, Peebles Branch, are now permanently installed at the front of the Old Parish

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at

of thousands of extra microfibres to be released into our water systems and end up in the sea, scientists have found.Although regular washing cycles cause clothes to be bashed together and create more friction between garments, they use less water than gentler programmes which agitate the garments less, they said.Researchers at Newcastle University found that it is the volume of water used, rather than the spinning action in the drum, which is the key factor in plucking the tiny plastic particles from man-made material.Millions of plastic microfibres are shed every time we wash clothes that contain materials such as nylon, polyester and acrylic.Because these fibres are so small, they drain out of the back of the washing machine and can ultimately enter the marine environment, where they can be ingested by tiny animals and end up in our food chain.Two years ago, Newcastle University scientists showed for the first time these fibres have now reached the deepest parts of our ocean.PhD student Max Kelly, working with Procter  Gamblersquos Newcastle lab, measured the release of microfibres from polyester clothes from a range of dferent cycles, temperatures and water volumes.Counting the fibres released, they found the higher the volume of water the more fibres released, regardless of the speed and abrasive forces of the washing machine.Using a hi-tech camera, they counted . million fibres from a delicate wash of a polyester garment, , when a normal cotton wash was used and , from a cold express programme.Mr Kelly said: ldquoCounter-intuitively, we discovered that lsquodelicatersquo cycles release more plastic microfibres into the water, and then the environment, than standard cycles.--vw,vw,px, px\"Max Kellyand marine microbiologist Professor J Grant Burgess check clothing in a washing machine --ldquoPrevious research has suggested the speed the drum spins at, the number of times it changes spinning direction during a cycle and theof pauses in the cycle ndash all known as the machine agitation ndash is the most important factor in the amount of microfibre released.ldquoBut we have shown here that even at reduced levels of agitation, microfibre release is still greatest with higher water volume-to-fabric ratios.ldquoThis is because the high volume of water used in a delicate cycle which is supposed to protect sensitive clothing from damage actually lsquoplucksrsquo away more fibres from the material.Consumers should make sure they are using the correct cycle for their laundry and avoid washing half loads so there is not a high volume of water to garments.Dr Neil Lant, a research fellow at PG who worked on the project, said: ldquoPeople thought quite intuitively that a delicate wash cycle would reduce loss of fibres because the fibres are rubbing against each other less.--vw,vw,px, px\"Max Kelly adds segments of material to a laboratory controlled lsquominirsquo washing machine --He said garments from natural fibres such as wool or silk should still be washed on a delicate programme.Washing machine manufacturers have developed microfibre filters to catch the mini-pollutants before they are released into the water system while the textile industry has worked on reducing fibre shedding.Marine microbiologist Professor Grant Burgess said it was thought the microfibres can clog the digestive systems of the tiny animals that ingest them.He added: ldquoSome of these fibres can attract pollutants and toxic chemicals which stick on to the fibres.ldquoThey can act as concentrators of other toxic pollutants and act as a carrier of these nasty chemicals.The findings have been published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Using

Netanyahu has started the daunting task of trying to cobble together a coalition government amid political deadlock that emerged from this monthrsquos repeat elections, which had no clear winner.He now has up to six weeks to attempt to resolve the political impasse, but his odds appear slim.Even with the support of smaller allies, both Mr Netanyahu and his main challenger, Blue and White party leader and former army chief Benny Gantz, lack the support for the required -seat parliamentary majority needed to establish a government.That is including the support of Mr Netanyahursquos traditional ultra-Orthodox and religious-nationalist allies.On Thursday, the parties were jockeying ahead of a planned meeting by their negotiating teams the following day, with each side blaming the other for the stalemate.ldquoThere are no rabbits in the hat. There are no tricks. There is no option, other than unity, said Zeev Elkin, a politician with Mr Netanyahursquos Likud party.He told Israeli Army Radio thatBlue and White ldquocontinues to rule out Netanyahu on a personal basis and continues to rule out certain parties from sitting in that same unity government, at the end we may head to elections for a third time.Blue and White wants Mr Gantz to lead any unity government and refuses to sit in a coalition with Mr Netanyahu so long as he faces likely indictment for a series of corruption scandals.Blue and White also objects to sitting with the right-wing and religious bloc that Netanyahu says he is committed to bringing into any government he forms.President Reuven Rivlin selected Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday as the candidate with the best chance of forming a government.--vw,vw,px, px\"Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz --That move came after Mr Rivlin failed to broker a unity government between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz in recent days.A unity government appears to be the preferred option for both sides, but they remain far apart on what such a constellation would look like.According to the final official results from the September  elections, Blue and White finished first with  seats in the -seat parliament, just ahead of Mr Netanyahursquos Likud with  seats.Neither side can form a government without the eight seats held by maverick former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who supports bringing the two main parties into a unity government shorn of Mr Netanyahursquos traditional allies.Mr Netanyahu has welcomed a unity government but has insisted on one that includes those partners.--vw,vw,px, px\"Israeli President Reuven Rivlin has asked Mr Netanyahu to form a government --If Mr Netanyahu fails to form a government before time runs out, Mr Rivlin can then ask Mr Gantz to try.If he too does not succeed, Mr Rivlin can select another legislator or he can set in motion what would be unprecedented third elections.Looming large over the political jostling are Mr Netanyahursquos legal woes.Israelrsquos attorney general has recommended charging Mr Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a series of scandals and the embattled leader is set to appear at a hearing next week on the charges.The likelihood of an indictment is high and could be handed down within weeks.Although Mr Netanyahu is not required by Israeli law to step downcharged, he will face heavy pressure to do so..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Israel us Benjamin Netanyahu looks for partners in bid to form coalition"},{"url":null,"title":"letter independence march","story":"I didn#t march because my aged legs don#t carry me far these days, but I#m not ashamed to be a supporter of independence.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain

them into it, said Carol.ldquoThe connector could give them a realistic sense of what the group is like.Connectors can also volunteer their time to accompany someone, for example, to the gym on a one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you have been through something that is a huge setback then your confidence is that much lower.As well as mental health, other reasons people could use Community Connections could be due to accident,

Our revenue and markets are plundered by the online providers of free, unregulated and often misleading and inaccurate content.And yes the BBC are also a large part of the problem. Funded lavishly by taxpayers, including a whopping poundm for the barely watched new BBC Scotland channel - where there is no measure of success and no audience targets to hit to prove its worth!Together with Facebook and Google their uncontrolled reach now extends into markets once the preserve of local publishers - costing jobs and closing titles.:The Papers: Why we let a BBC crew film The Herald newsroomWe are not immune and we have been open with staff about the resultant financial pressures. Sadly it is now the norm in the publishing world but as you will see again tonight there is a resilience - a bunker mentality that keeps us going.Thankfully all of those who have departed in the past  months have done so voluntary. In many cases such as our sports reporter Alison McConnell they have opted to go freelance and had the financial cushion of continuing to write paid columns for us. We retain talent but on a reduced cost base.As with almost all industries, we need to continually adapt to new technology and new demands. That means taking advantage of process efficiencies and evaluating the importance and priority of resource.Were fortunate that with fewer photographers available in these constrained times, the modern journalist is now so multiskilled that they can take stills, shoot video and upload to site using only the smartphone in their hand. A letime away from the sacred art of developing film or even inserting an HD card. Its this combination of old and new that allows us to evolve and maintain quality, while enriching what we can offer our audience.As a national newspaper the quality threshold is much higher but that does not stop questions being asked and assessments made. In last weekrsquos show, our brilliant photographer Kirsty was filmed waiting for two hours in the torrential rain with our competitors to capture Prime Minister Theresa May. As an editor thatrsquos a valued picture. As a manager thats not the most effective use of her time, albeit we didnrsquot know the PMs arrival was going to be as delayed.And that in essence is the choices we now make. There is no right or wrong just a matter of balance and understanding of our markets and reader expectations.Similarly, the roles and numbers of those involved in the production process have been streamlined as we have taken advantage of technology and put more emphasis on getting it right first time.:Queen lsquoshould resignrsquo for her part in prorogation, says MSPWould I rather have numerous eyes on the same piece of reporting or fewer eyes on that single article and more reporters producing more content Reporters can now use technology to write their copy straight onto the electronic page, adding their own headline and providing picturesrequired - and filing it to our websites with links to added or associated content. I very much doubt I could have mastered all of that when I set out  years ago but for young journalists being truly multi-media is second nature. An iPad is the new comfort blanket for toddlers!Again, for a national newspaper, there is a higher quality threshold and we still need to ensure all copy is checked at least once for errors and accuracy. The small team work incredibly hard regard casting their eyes over thousands of words every day. Occasionally a typo will slip by and I apologise.That makes for dficult conversations and in that respect, we are no dferent to many other professions.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"chief-policing-parades-not-sustainable","story":"Iain Livingstone yesterday told his ruling watchdog too many of his officers were being dragged away from their normal duties this marching season.The chief and onehis deputies, Northern Ireland veteran Will Kerr, also railed against ldquoutterly unacceptable violence against police.Earlier this month six parades ndash Republican and Loyalist ndash were banned by Glasgow City Council amid concerns over public safety.The rare action came after clashes between rival groups on successive weekends, with officers among those injured.Police Scotland mobilised  officers from across Scotland in Glasgow for one September weekend of marches and counter-protests.

Throwing coins at officers. hitting them in the head and legs. Spitting on officers faces, kicking at their legs, throwing stones, one of which hit an officers in the face, punching officers to the face.ldquoThat is just wholly unacceptable. It cannot be right in  that we have officers deployed to protect their communities subject to that level of violence both at parades and associated protests or at football matches.Mr Kerr urged a sense of perspective. Citing his  years in Belfast policing, he stressed that only a tiny minority were involved in trouble. But he added: ldquoWe do need to have a clear, hard look at ourselves as to whether that is acceptable. We should not be putting officers in that position in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"sainsburys-closing-100-stores-major-business-overhaul","story":"The grocer said it expects to close up to  supermarkets,  convenience stores and  Argos branches.

That is the equivalent of slightly over one unit, or roughly half a pint of beer.The fact that that sounds insignicant is part of the reason researchers believe the policy is working: the majority of the population appear to be largely unaffected.In fact, when households were split into five categories ranging from those who bought the least amount of alcohol from supermarkets and off-sales to those who bought the most, there was virtually no change in purchasing habit among the first four groups.By far, it was the highest consuming households that cut back on buying alcohol - accounting for a weekly drop of around g per adult.The study noted that the reduction was greater in \"lower income households and only occurred in the top fth of households by income that purchased the greatest amount of alcohol\".: Mothers horror as son, , pulled unconscious from Renfrewshire loch - as paramedic said he did not expect boy to surviveHowever, the authors also stress that while the impact of MUP was \"greater on lower as opposed to higher income households, changes in weekly expenditure were not systemically related to household income but rather with increasing household purchases of alcohol\".In other words, the evidence suggests it is neither penalising moderate drinkers on lower incomes nor leaving heavy drinkers at the top end of the salary scale untouched.As research from the Scottish Health Survey reiterated this week, it is the wealthiest middle class drinkers who are - on average - likeliest to consume alcohol in potentially harmful or hazardous quantities. They are the least likely to be non-drinkers and one in four exceeds the recommended  unit limit every week, compared to % in the poorest communities.Yet at the same, time we also know that extreme, heavy drinking - such as  units per week for men - is more common at the bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum, and that the heaviest drinkers also tend to consume greater quantities of the strongest, cheapest alcoholic beverages.: Jeane Freeman to give evidence to MSPs on hospitals debacleNotably, th BMJ study found the largest reductions in consumption were for beer, spirits and cider.The authors state: \"Given that these categories include own-brand spirits and high strength white ciders that MUP sought to target, our data suggest that the policy has achieved its ambition to make relatively cheap and strong alcohol less affordable, which in turn should positively impact public health over time.\"The public health benefits could also exceed expectations. Before the policy was introduced, modelling predicted that it would result in , fewer alcohol-related deaths and , alcohol-related hospital admissions over the first  years compared to a Scotland without MUP.However, that was predicated on an annual reduction in alcohol consumption per drinker of around .% . In contrast, the BMJ study found that MUP has coincided with a .% reduction - . times what was estimated.Of course, alcohol purchased in bars and restaurants is not covered by the research - but since heavier drinkers tend to get a larger share of their intake from off-sales, and MUP had no effect on on-trade prices, it is unlikely to have changed signicantly.Nonetheless, Dr Eric Carlin, director of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems , said it was still too early to say with certainty that MUP had worked or was \"some kind of magic bullet for alcohol harms\".He said: \"Its really important to keep emphasising that this looks good, we expected it to be moving in this direction based on all of the modelling and based on the evidence from Canada. But we do have to wait and see.\"ldquoThere is every reason to remain confident that the benefits from MUP will continue to build.\""},{"url":null,"title":"plans-slash-carbon-emissions-net-zero-2045-voted-holyrood","story":"An overwhelming majority of MSPs backed the legislation, which also aims to cut emissions by  per cent by .Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the targets were by far the most ambitious of any country anywhere in the world.But the Scottish Greens refused to support the Climate Change Bill, insisting it did not go far enough.The partyrsquos climate spokesman Mark Ruskell said: ldquoThis bill represents progress, but it is progress at a snailrsquos pace, and as one climate striker last week put it, lsquoits no good being the fastest snailrsquo in the face of a global crisis.ldquoThe lack of ambition on the ten-year timescale demanded by climate science, for example, ignores the demands of the tens of thousands who took to the streets last week.Mr Ruskell insisted the legislation was nowhere near the meaningful action needed to address the climate emergency.He added: ldquoThe other parties cannot hide behind targets.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A body recovered near Boddam is believed to be that of Ruairidh Sandison\"  A body recovered from the coast near Boddam is thought to be that of missing man Ruairidh Sandison. viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We should not underestimate our achievements to date in tackling climate change – we have already almost halved emissions since . “We cannot, however, be complacent.

They are then being asked to report where and when they saw them on the Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels websitescottishsquirrels.org.uk.Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels is a partnership project led by the Scottish Wildle Trust that is working to protect red squirrels where they are most under threat from the spread of non-native grey squirrels. Squirrel sightings received from the public help the project understand how red and grey squirrel populations are changing over time and decide where to focus conservation efforts.Prject manager Dr Mel Tonkin said: “We monitor squirrel populations throughout the year, and in  we received an incredible  squirrel sightings from members of the public.“This year, thanks to support from National Lottery players, we’re trying something a bit dferent.“By going out and looking for squirrels during the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey people can help us create a more detailed snapshot of the current situation on the ground.”Autumn is an ideal time of year for squirrel-watching. With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries. They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

The labels specy what can be recycled at kerbside and give details of where more information can be found.Crews will aim to cover all recycling bins by the end of the month, but stickers will also be available for residents at household recycling centres .More information about recycling can be found on the council’s website, from checking recycling bin day to an A-Z recycling guide and what happens to the materials afterwards.Councillor Peter Argyle, chair of the infrastructure services committee, said: “Recycle Week is a great opportunity for householders to make a positive contribution to Aberdeenshire’s recycling efforts. “We hope the information provided during the week will encourage residents to make a push towards increased recycling rates.”For a complete guide on the materials that can be recycled in Aberdeenshire, see the A-Z guide at http:bit.ly AshireAZ.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Two years ago, Newcastle University scientists showed for the first time these fibres have now reached the deepest parts of our ocean.PhD student Max Kelly, working with Procter  Gamblersquos Newcastle lab, measured the release of microfibres from polyester clothes from a range of dferent cycles, temperatures and water volumes.Counting the fibres released, they found the higher the volume of water the more fibres released, regardless of the speed and abrasive forces of the washing machine.Using a hi-tech camera, they counted . million fibres from a delicate wash of a polyester garment, , when a normal cotton wash was used and , from a cold express programme.Mr Kelly said: ldquoCounter-intuitively, we discovered that lsquodelicatersquo cycles release more plastic microfibres into the water, and then the environment, than standard cycles. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Max Kellyand marine microbiologist Professor J Grant Burgess check clothing in a washing machine--ldquoPrevious research has suggested the speed the drum spins at, the number of times it changes spinning direction during a cycle and theof pauses in the cycle ndash all known as the machine agitation ndash is the most important factor in the amount of microfibre released.ldquoBut we have shown here that even at reduced levels of agitation, microfibre release is still greatest with higher water volume-to-fabric ratios.ldquoThis is because the high volume of water used in a delicate cycle which is supposed to protect sensitive clothing from damage actually lsquoplucksrsquo away more fibres from the material.Consumers should make sure they are using the correct cycle for their laundry and avoid washing half loads so there is not a high volume of water to garments.Dr Neil Lant, a research fellow at PG who worked on the project, said: ldquoPeople thought quite intuitively that a delicate wash cycle would reduce loss of fibres because the fibres are rubbing against each other less. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Max Kelly adds segments of material to a laboratory controlled lsquominirsquo washing machine--He said garments from natural fibres such as wool or silk should still be washed on a delicate programme.Washing machine manufacturers have developed microfibre filters to catch the mini-pollutants before they are released into the water system while the textile industry has worked on reducing fibre shedding.Marine microbiologist Professor Grant Burgess said it was thought the microfibres can clog the digestive systems of the tiny animals that ingest them.He added: ldquoSome of these fibres can attract pollutants and toxic chemicals which stick on to the fibres.ldquoThey can act as concentrators of other toxic pollutants and act as a carrier of these nasty chemicals.The findings have been published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.copy -.

On Thursday, the parties were jockeying ahead of a planned meeting by their negotiating teams the following day, with each side blaming the other for the stalemate.ldquoThere are no rabbits in the hat. There are no tricks. There is no option, other than unity, said Zeev Elkin, a politician with Mr Netanyahursquos Likud party.He told Israeli Army Radio thatBlue and White ldquocontinues to rule out Netanyahu on a personal basis and continues to rule out certain parties from sitting in that same unity government, at the end we may head to elections for a third time.Blue and White wants Mr Gantz to lead any unity government and refuses to sit in a coalition with Mr Netanyahu so long as he faces likely indictment for a series of corruption scandals.Blue and White also objects to sitting with the right-wing and religious bloc that Netanyahu says he is committed to bringing into any government he forms.President Reuven Rivlin selected Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday as the candidate with the best chance of forming a government. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz--That move came after Mr Rivlin failed to broker a unity government between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz in recent days.A unity government appears to be the preferred option for both sides, but they remain far apart on what such a constellation would look like.According to the final official results from the September  elections, Blue and White finished first with  seats in the -seat parliament, just ahead of Mr Netanyahursquos Likud with  seats.Neither side can form a government without the eight seats held by maverick former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who supports bringing the two main parties into a unity government shorn of Mr Netanyahursquos traditional allies.Mr Netanyahu has welcomed a unity government but has insisted on one that includes those partners. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Israeli President Reuven Rivlin has asked Mr Netanyahu to form a government--If Mr Netanyahu fails to form a government before time runs out, Mr Rivlin can then ask Mr Gantz to try.If he too does not succeed, Mr Rivlin can select another legislator or he can set in motion what would be unprecedented third elections.Looming large over the political jostling are Mr Netanyahursquos legal woes.Israelrsquos attorney general has recommended charging Mr Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a series of scandals and the embattled leader is set to appear at a hearing next week on the charges.The likelihood of an indictment is high and could be handed down within weeks.Although Mr Netanyahu is not required by Israeli law to step downcharged, he will face heavy pressure to do so.copy -.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever. Once the immediate challenge of repatriation is complete, efforts have to turn to supporting the Thomas Cook employees into alternative employment as quickly as possible. It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait. Others waiting to fly home, can be reassured that the Government will arrange alternative flights for them.The thousands out of work as a result of Thomas Cook’s demise have no such reassurance today. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"richard madden jack lowden kelly macdonald and jenna coleman in running for bafta scotland honours","story":"Child abduction mystery The Cry, which Doctor Who favourite Coleman starred in and was partly filmed in Glasgow, leads the honours race along with Wild Rose, the Glasgow-set hit about a young country singer, played by Irish actress Jessie Buckley, trying to make it to Nashville after getting out of jail.The BAFTA Scotland ceremony, which will be hosted by broadcaster Edith Bowman in Glasgow on  November, will be shown on BBC Scotlandrsquos channel, its first TV coverage in more than a decade.Organisers revealed they had seen an almost of almost  per cent in entries in the space of  months and also hailed the ersity of the shortlists, following criticism in previous years about the number of women nominated for major honours.

It shows that delivering Nicola Sturgeon’s referendum on independence won’t just ide our country all over again, it will push your school, your local hospital and your high street to the back of the queue.” He added: “With violent crime on the rise, hospital projects in tatters, and our education system failing to deliver, she needs to listen for once. Dump the independence referendum, and focus on what really matters.”Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “Another referendum would be a huge distraction for the civil service, meaning services such as schools and hospitals would be neglected. We don’t need another Scexit referendum, we need a government that focuses on the day job it was elected to do.”A spokesperson for Mr Russell said: “We have been entirely open about the fact we are preparing for a referendum, and this material shows how, regardless of that, it is Brexit which is impacting on day- to-day work in other areas. For the Tories – whose bosses at Westminster have been reduced to a zombie government with no legislative programme at all – their comments are borderline delusional.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"door now wide open independent nw university derry university group","story":"A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has responded to the report on higher education published by Julian Smith.We welcome the clarity provided by this report and intend to respond in full in due course.At the outset, we wish to thank Lord Andrew Adonis, the Shadow Employment Minister Mike Amesbury MP and the Shadow Schools Minister Mike Kane MP for championing this issue at Westminster, and also the authors of this report.The Shadow Education Minister Angela Rayner has also raised the prospect of Derry availing of Transformation Fundingand we thank her for that proposal.On initial reading, this report provides a roadmap as to how the North West can develop its own autonomous university.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference.

It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the

the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery couple aiming high

In the fth minute a free was given away by the lsquoFin defence and Cormac Venney slotted over from the m line.In the sixth minute a superb full-pitch move from the lsquoFin was finished by Breannain McComiskey, restoring the two-point lead.A minute later Garland was clinical when he drove to the net to put the lsquoFin firmly in the driving seat. Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game. Excellent game management from the lsquoFin as they saw out a first ever championship win over their derby rivals.Impressive performances from Garland and Flanagan in attack while in defence the full back line of Brannigan, Dillon and Willoughby was superb with McComiskey putting in a big sht on the .Dundrum were best served by Eamon King in goal, Hurley, McShane in defence and their key forward Glavin.Dundrum: E King, R Carey, R McGuigan, C Miskelly, T McShane, J Hurley, A Doyle, N Rogers, Odhran McKibbin, P Curry, A Fegan , K Glavin , Oisisn McKibbin, C Venney , C Mulholland.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We appreciate that while this may only be the start of the process, we would call on the landowners to talk to us and the local council.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOur door is open and we are happy to chat. We very much view ourselves as good neighbours. We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was. But we didn’t do too badly, no.”l Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast tonight on BBC One Northern Ireland and also simultaneously on BBC Four at pm.try catch  TrendingN.I.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two years ago, Newcastle University scientists showed for the first time these fibres have now reached the deepest parts of our ocean.PhD student Max Kelly, working with Procter  Gamblersquos Newcastle lab, measured the release of microfibres from polyester clothes from a range of dferent cycles, temperatures and water volumes.Counting the fibres released, they found the higher the volume of water the more fibres released, regardless of the speed and abrasive forces of the washing machine.Using a hi-tech camera, they counted . million fibres from a delicate wash of a polyester garment, , when a normal cotton wash was used and , from a cold express programme.Mr Kelly said: ldquoCounter-intuitively, we discovered that lsquodelicatersquo cycles release more plastic microfibres into the water, and then the environment, than standard cycles. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Max Kellyand marine microbiologist Professor J Grant Burgess check clothing in a washing machine  --ldquoPrevious research has suggested the speed the drum spins at, the number of times it changes spinning direction during a cycle and theof pauses in the cycle ndash all known as the machine agitation ndash is the most important factor in the amount of microfibre released.ldquoBut we have shown here that even at reduced levels of agitation, microfibre release is still greatest with higher water volume-to-fabric ratios.ldquoThis is because the high volume of water used in a delicate cycle which is supposed to protect sensitive clothing from damage actually lsquoplucksrsquo away more fibres from the material.Consumers should make sure they are using the correct cycle for their laundry and avoid washing half loads so there is not a high volume of water to garments.Dr Neil Lant, a research fellow at PG who worked on the project, said: ldquoPeople thought quite intuitively that a delicate wash cycle would reduce loss of fibres because the fibres are rubbing against each other less. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Max Kelly adds segments of material to a laboratory controlled lsquominirsquo washing machine  --He said garments from natural fibres such as wool or silk should still be washed on a delicate programme.Washing machine manufacturers have developed microfibre filters to catch the mini-pollutants before they are released into the water system while the textile industry has worked on reducing fibre shedding.Marine microbiologist Professor Grant Burgess said it was thought the microfibres can clog the digestive systems of the tiny animals that ingest them.He added: ldquoSome of these fibres can attract pollutants and toxic chemicals which stick on to the fibres.ldquoThey can act as concentrators of other toxic pollutants and act as a carrier of these nasty chemicals.The findings have been published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Using delicate cycle for everyday laundry can release more microfibres  u study article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On Thursday, the parties were jockeying ahead of a planned meeting by their negotiating teams the following day, with each side blaming the other for the stalemate.ldquoThere are no rabbits in the hat. There are no tricks. There is no option, other than unity, said Zeev Elkin, a politician with Mr Netanyahursquos Likud party.He told Israeli Army Radio thatBlue and White ldquocontinues to rule out Netanyahu on a personal basis and continues to rule out certain parties from sitting in that same unity government, at the end we may head to elections for a third time.Blue and White wants Mr Gantz to lead any unity government and refuses to sit in a coalition with Mr Netanyahu so long as he faces likely indictment for a series of corruption scandals.Blue and White also objects to sitting with the right-wing and religious bloc that Netanyahu says he is committed to bringing into any government he forms.President Reuven Rivlin selected Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday as the candidate with the best chance of forming a government. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz  --That move came after Mr Rivlin failed to broker a unity government between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz in recent days.A unity government appears to be the preferred option for both sides, but they remain far apart on what such a constellation would look like.According to the final official results from the September  elections, Blue and White finished first with  seats in the -seat parliament, just ahead of Mr Netanyahursquos Likud with  seats.Neither side can form a government without the eight seats held by maverick former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who supports bringing the two main parties into a unity government shorn of Mr Netanyahursquos traditional allies.Mr Netanyahu has welcomed a unity government but has insisted on one that includes those partners. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Israeli President Reuven Rivlin has asked Mr Netanyahu to form a government  --If Mr Netanyahu fails to form a government before time runs out, Mr Rivlin can then ask Mr Gantz to try.If he too does not succeed, Mr Rivlin can select another legislator or he can set in motion what would be unprecedented third elections.Looming large over the political jostling are Mr Netanyahursquos legal woes.Israelrsquos attorney general has recommended charging Mr Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a series of scandals and the embattled leader is set to appear at a hearing next week on the charges.The likelihood of an indictment is high and could be handed down within weeks.Although Mr Netanyahu is not required by Israeli law to step downcharged, he will face heavy pressure to do so..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Israel us Benjamin Netanyahu looks for partners in bid to form coalition article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This rushed legislation was nailed on to a wider piece of legislation at Westminster and was passed despite the opposition of my DUP MP colleagues and with no form of public consultation whatsoever.“Our motion called for a meaningful letter to be sent on behalf of our Borough to reflect the very genuine and signicant concerns that exist around this issue.” Cllr. Greenfield who seconded the motion said this legislation is ‘a step too far’. “As demonstrated in recent times thousands of people share the view that Westminster should retract this drastic legislation at the earliest opportunity, given its serious ramications and the manner in which it has been brought..”SDLP Cllr Joe Nelson said it was an emotional debate as there are very strong views on both sides of the issue. “The SDLP remains a pro-le party but has in recent times allowed members to have a conscience vote. This is a move I did not support as I feel we have to be absolutely clear about our position. Speaking in support of the motion, after Sinn Fein had tried to get the debate stopped on a point of order, I gave my personal views as a practicing Catholic on the sanctity of le, We must consider that at around  weeks the child has a heartbeat and that modern D scans show that at   weeks the features have formed. “We agree that there is more support required for women who are suffering crisis pregnancies and more should be done. All members of the SDLP on ABC council voted in favour of the motion giving the clear signal that the SDLP group in ABC Council is very clearly Pro-Le.”Alliance Cllr Eoin Tennyson said the issue was ‘not black and white’. “Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance. Personally, I would like to see decriminalisation, with access to free, safe and legal termination within strict gestational limits. I believe the best place for it to be considered is in the Assembly. However, the irony of the DUP’s motion is that they are one of the main stumbling blocks to that happening.”Sinn Fein declined to comment. and Liam Shannon pictured outside Belfast court with some of their legal team.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
