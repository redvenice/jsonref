The new government\u0027s plan to increase welfare spending could clash with EU budget rules. On Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker criticised Italy, saying its citizens should work more and be less corrupt.Italy has faced political instability for three months after inconclusive March elections, rocking financial markets and spreading unease among its euro partners.

Five...Italy lurches towards yet another poll if a ruling...Share this article    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini (pictured) was named interior minister He took control of the rightwing coalition that won the most votes in March\u0027s election when his League party surpassed ally Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia.Since taking over the old Northern League in 2013, Salvini has ridden a wave of public discontent, playing on anti-immigrant sentiment as he sought to shift the party\u0027s image from defender of the wealthy north against its \u0027parasite\u0027 south, to that of guardian of Italy\u0027s national sovereignty.Now he\u0027s heading into government with southerner Luigi Di Maio and the Five Star Movement, which picked up the vast majority of its seats in the south.Since Salvini took over the League, nearly 700,000 people have landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean sparking a sense of resentment among many Italians who feel Europe has abandoned them - a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                         In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals - which include a universal basic income for Italy\u0027s poorest, rolling back pension reform and a two tier flat tax - have worried Brussels and financial markets given the country\u0027s sizeable debt.  Italy\u0027s 2.3 trillion euros of debt is 132 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest ratio in Europe apart from Greece and more than double the bloc\u0027s 60-percent ceiling.The government programme includes plans to speed up expulsions of illegal immigrants and crack down on trafficking. The eurosceptic coalition also promises a series of measures to reign in the EU including renegotiation of EU treaties and a review of the bloc\u0027s economic governance on issues such as the single currency.  But on Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned against blaming the EU for all of Italy\u0027s problems.\u0027I\u0027m in deep love with Italy, Bella Italia. But I no longer accept that everything which is going wrong in South of Italy, in Mezzogiorno, is explained by the fact that the EU or the European Commission would not do enough,\u0027 he said after leaving a meeting in Brussels.\u0027Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.\u0027He urged Italy not to \u0027play this game\u0027 of holding the EU responsible, adding \u0027Nations first, Europe second.\u0027 Political neophyte Conte skipped teaching a class at the University of Florence to return to Rome after he was summoned to meet Mattarella at the presidential palace on Thursday night.            In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Carlo Cottarelli (pictured) announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/22/4CCC365000000578-0-image-a-6_1527803010343.jpg","title":"Thousands fly UK arent asked passports","story":"    Airport blunders have allowed up to 11,000 passengers over the last five years to enter Britain without going through passport control, figures show.The problem has been blamed on human errors such as incorrect doors being opened at arrival gates.More than 11,000 did not have their passports checked in the usual way from 2013 to the end of 2017 immediately after landing.Figures released by the Home Office show that 2,328 were misdirected last year – an average of six a day.

Airports ... need to face consequences.\u0027          Each year around 2,000 people bypassed border controls after they were sent the wrong way upon arrival at UK airportsThe Immigration Act 2016 provides a legal basis for the Border Force to levy a penalty if a misdirection occurs. Under new plans, fines could range from £2,500 to £50,000 depending on the number of passengers involved and action taken to rectify the blunder.The Airport Operators Association said the proposal is \u0027disproportionate\u0027 and described border security as a \u0027top priority\u0027 for airports.A spokesman said: \u0027The fact that the number of misdirected passengers as a proportion of total passengers travelling through UK airports has fallen significantly since 2013 demonstrates that our efforts to reduce the number of misdirections are having an effect.\u0027The Home Office said there were no cases of dangerous iniduals arriving unchecked because of a misdirection. However, it added that \u0027a civil penalty is a vital tool in ensuring\u0027 a reduction in passengers going astray.Around 288 million passengers pass through UK airports every year, according to latest figures. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/12/4CCE21F900000578-5794439-Samuel_Volery_broke_two_World_Records_in_Zurich_he_walked_a_tota-a-28_1527851849876.jpg","title":"Adrenaline junkies distance running new heights competing half marathon tightrope","story":"    So-called slackliners make their way between two tower blocks in Zurich, Switzerland.

The Photos were taken by a Russian journalist while Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met the North Korean dictator. It is not known if the meeting took place at this residence          From the atrium there is a far-reaching view down the driveway and out across the open countryside towards the mountains in the distance. Lavrov met with Kim while a former North Korean spy chief travelled to New York and met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in an attempt to salvage a summit between President Trump and KimThe two leaders are expected to sit down to negotiate the terms of North Korea\u0027s withdrawal from an effort to build a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States. The Russian photojournalist has also released pictures, taken at locations around Pyongyang, revealing unseen elements of day-to-day life inside the hermit kingdom.Although Kim has several palaces, pictures of them are hard to come by as the North Korean government has put in place tight security measures to make sure very few photographs exist. According to the tyrant\u0027s former bodyguard Lee Young-kuk, the North Korean leader keeps at least eight separate palaces outside the capital.During his visit, Lavrov  called for sanctions on North Korea to be lifted and invited Kim Jong-un for a meeting in Moscow as he met with the dictator in Pyongyang on Thursday.Sergei Lavrov was welcomed with open arms by Kim as he flew into the hermit kingdom in an apparent bid to curry favour ahead of a potential  summit between North Korea and the US.\u0027It is absolutely obvious that, as we start discussions on how to resolve the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, it is understood that the solution cannot be comprehensive without the lifting of sanctions,\u0027 Lavrov said in a press conference.He also urged the state to hold off on relinquishing their nuclear weapons until tangible action had been taken to lift the economic stranglehold.           Inside, the palace is simply decorated with neutral colours bedecking every wall and very few paintings displayed through the house          The gardens are dominated by an enormous water feature which sprays jets from a fountain over several ornate dolphin sculptures Women throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetChilling moment gang carry drunk and \u0027drugged\u0027 girl from clubShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageBizarre moment pub flower seller puts her hand down woman\u0027s topCrowds gather for Free Tommy Robinson protest in LeedsPeter Wohlleben talks about his book The Hidden Life of TreesPolice at the scene of stabbing of two police officers in GreenockLush Cosmetics new \u0027anti-spy cops\u0027 campaign has been criticisedLottery winners give over two thirds of their fortune awayAngry mob confront prostitutes accused of pickpocketing Brit tourists\u0027This cannot be achieved at one go\u0027, he added. \u0027There can be no immediate denuclearisation, this should be done step by step and all sides should go half-way during every single phase of this process\u0027. The meeting was the first ever between the North Korean leader and a Russian official -

the most critical of three tracks of negotiations currently taking place between the two governments in the U.S., in the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone, and in Singapore - are aimed at determining whether a meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un can be restored.

How hard could it be, we asked? As it turned out, very, very hard indeedIt’s a sight that makes you want to jam on a pair of wellies, grab a rake, and start pulling the rubbish out yourself.So the Mail, which has campaigned for ten years against the scourge of plastic bags, decided to try to do just that.Inspired by our wildly successful Great Plastic Pick Up, which saw thousands take part in nationwide litterpicks, we set out to get the Don cleaned up. How hard could it be, we asked? As it turned out, very, very hard indeed.LOUISE ATKINSON kept a diary of what happened next . . .May 7, 2018The Mail runs the picture, taken on May 4, on its front page — and there is outrage. John Hourston from the campaigning group Blue Planet Society said: ‘This is the worst picture of pollution in a British river I’ve ever seen and a real wake-up call. The majority of the litter is single-use plastic.’The problem started after heavy rains in April washed floating debris into the water.As the Don flows through Doncaster it splits into numerous channels and waterways designed to stop flooding. At two points along the river’s length the current is artificially slowed.One is just by the Don Aqueduct, where the front-page picture was taken, and the other is at the back of Doncaster Prison, 15 minutes further downstream. Both spots are disgusting soups of plastic rubbish. I’m keen to tackle both.May 8REVEALED: Child is found alive in house of horrors where...EXCLUSIVE - Kimberly Guilfoyle and Don Jr. rush into dinner...Share this articleI start my inquiries, full of optimism that I can get this sorted — fast! Surely all I need is a gang of can-do volunteers, a couple of canoes and a very large roll of rubbish bags?So I check with charity Keep Britain Tidy and deputy chief executive Richard McIlwain stops my plans in their tracks: it seems I haven’t thought about today’s ever present health-and-safety rules.‘Many people are horrified at the state of our precious waterways and want to do something about it,’ he says. ‘But there can be real danger working in rivers.’He suggests first calling the Environment Agency, a government body in charge of public land and responsible for managing flooding and pollution. So I call its 24-hour incident hotline (finding the number takes some doing) to report the mess — and ask whether I can help clear it up. The hotline operative gives me an incident number and tells me to call General Enquiries in 20 minutes once my report has been logged to see if they’ll put me through to a Yorkshire-based officer. I do as I am told, but the phone operater seems perplexed. The Yorkshire-based duty officer would be the person to decide whether to accept help from the public, he says, but it was unlikely. This is all academic anyway as he won’t put me through to the duty officer.I asked if anything would be done about the horrifying mess I’d reported. He said I’d get ‘feedback within ten days’, which seems a long time to wait.That’s when I spot that a Yorkshire Environment Agency officer has tweeted the Mail’s pictures of the Don with a message: ‘I’ve taken a few reports this week of plastic and rubbish building up. We are working with landowners to get the waste removed ASAP for environmental reasons.’I send a message to him to ask how the clear-up is progressing and if he needs a hand. No reply.Surely I can do something?Keep Britain Tidy’s Richard next suggests trying the Canals And Rivers Trust, an independent charity funded by public money which has guardianship of our canals, rivers, reservoirs and docks and responsibility for keeping waterways open and useful for boats.          How shaming, then, that this image, which was published on the Mail’s front page a month ago, wasn’t taken in some impoverished part of the world but in Yorkshire — right in the middle of DoncasterOne of their employees tells me they hold clean-ups around Doncaster’s waterways twice a month but that there are no imminent plans to target the areas in the pictures.The problem for both spots, he reveals, is that any clean-up crew can’t just wade in and start pulling out plastic bottles. Any clean-up requires legal permission from whoever owns the land on the river bank as the crews will have to cross it to get to the rubbish. There also has to be a proper risk assessment and trained experts on hand for jobs like this.Establishing who owns the land is another headache. Doncaster Council says the site behind the prison isn’t theirs, and suggests I try the Land Registry website to establish ownership. The website is complex — and demands a £14.95 payment for any kind of access. Once I’ve logged in — and paid up — it can’t give me a clear answer who owns the land.May 9Having faced nothing but brick walls I decide to wield the Daily Mail’s muscle (admittedly not available to the average citizen) and try to bypass the hotlines and go straight to the top. So I call a press officer at Environment Agency HQ in London to tell him the Mail is offering to help clear it all up — and when can we start?He says he’ll look into it, and get back to me. He doesn’t. I’m beginning to get a little exasperated.Keep Britain Tidy’s Richard sympathises. He previously worked at the Environment Agency and tells me the Land Registry doesn’t log every piece of land ownership and besides, waterways are difficult. In the UK access to rivers is governed by ancient laws and any clean-up has to approved by whoever owns the land that abuts it.It might be the council, a private owner or any number of different bodies — from water firms to farms to nature reserves to foreign companies — he says.What’s more, if they only own one river bank that permission will only reach to precisely half way across the river.Stretch over the halfway point to grab an empty bottle and you could be treading on someone else’s toes so you need permission from both sides. ‘Access to rivers in England is a big bone of contention. It can sometimes be ridiculous,’ he adds wearily.You don’t say.May 10One river bank at the prison site lies at the back of the prison and the other has a small industrial estate beside it. I email the prison. No response. So I call the switchboard. The operator suggests I try the prison press office. The press officer tells me it’s not prison land — the prison merely operates on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. So I call the Ministry of Justice. They seem bemused. They ask me to email details, which I do.Then I try a bit of old-fashioned sleuthing. Holding a magnifying glass over the photo I can read the phone number on an advertising hoarding by a company called Eaton Commercial. Maybe they will know who owns the land? I call. The line is dead.May 14Just as the Great Plastic Pick Up is coming to its close I get a call from the national press officer for the Canals And Rivers Trust.She tells me they are responsible for only the towpaths and ensuring the water is navigable by boats. She says they aren’t responsible for rubbish left on or washing up on the banks — that’s a problem for the landowners, she says or my old friends the Environment Agency. ‘We’re not the river authority there,’ she says, adding, ‘It can be quite complex.’          It showed part of the River Don, which flows for nearly 70 miles from the Pennines through Sheffield and Rotherham before flowing out into the Humber Estuary — meaning this trash was headed straight out to seaMay 18I’m starting to wonder if we can speed things up a bit by offering to hire a professional SWAT team of cleaners to go in and do the clean up.I ask the Canals And Rivers Trust and they respond by presenting a different aqueduct in Wakefield which they say has created a similar plastic build-up.This one doesn’t have the same tricky land ownership issues as the two Doncaster sites. ‘It got really bad last month after the rain,’ says the press officer, ‘and it is now becoming a target for anti-social behaviour, with bits of debris being set on fire.’She says her team have been quoted a staggering £40,000 by private clearance crews to clear it up. The Trust is a charity, and £40,000 is a big chunk of its budget.It also goes some way to help explain why the various different authorities are so unwilling to leap in and clear up a stretch of water if the clean-up cost could be someone else’s responsibility. With that kind of public money required, is it really surprising responsibility gets batted back and forth while these sites remain toxic?May 20The Bank Holiday weekend has been bringing out the crowds and in Doncaster town centre, the rubbish is building up. Now there are at least another thousand plastic bottles and dozens of partially deflated footballs among the old tyres and discarded gas canisters.The warm May weather has brought flies and the trapped water has become stagnant with patches of soupy green algae. The place stinks and is swarming with flies.May 24The Canals And Rivers Trust calls to tell me a team has carried out a routine inspection of the aqueduct and in so doing, cleared a small amount of the debris.When I point out the mind-boggling short-sightedness of leaving a load of plastic rubbish there until it presents a serious risk, the spokeswoman says: ‘We’d be very happy to work with the Environment Agency to ensure a bigger clear-up happens, but this is not something we can initiate.’I’m astounded. I’ve been talking to both bodies for the past three weeks: is it really up to me to act as cupid here and get the two parties to liaise?When I go back to the press office for the Environment Agency I get my first glimpse of a breakthrough.Their spokeswoman says: ‘Our role is flood risk and water quality,’ the press officer explains. ‘We sent engineers out there to check the rubbish hadn’t created a flood risk, and checked whether it was polluting the water (you can normally tell if it is foaming, changes colour or smells bad) and they were confident there was no risk of serious damage to the eco-system.‘Although we can assure people there is no immediate risk of flooding or water quality pollution, we will work with the landowners and council to get the waste removed.’ So something is being done? They wouldn’t confirm.I ask for details, a time scale, anything ... but hear nothing.May 25The Canals And River’s Trust says they’ve drawn a blank with the site behind the prison. ‘The river is not navigable here, so it wouldn’t be possible to send out volunteers on canoes, which we do in other places. It’s also not practical to do it by hand from land. The job would be to hire some kind of crane to grab it all.’I’m back at square one on that one. Richard is sympathetic to my plight: ‘Litter in our rivers is unsightly and causes harm to native wildlife, while of course providing the route to sea for much of our plastic litter. While accepting that issues of land ownership and responsibility can be complex, this can’t be a recipe for inaction.’But he says there are fine examples of partnerships working around the country, where Keep Britain Tidy, the Environment Agency and companies, such as Severn Trent Water and Anglian Water, work with local volunteers to get litter cleared from rivers. So it can be done.May 30A month has passed. I’m on the verge of giving up. Then I get a surprise call from a very helpful press officer at the Environment Agency who tells me things are moving forwards. ‘Our team has been contacting the landowners and the local council,’ she says.Next the Canals And Rivers Trust calls to say one of their engineers has revealed that the two bodies really are actually working together to come up with a plan for the prison site. And at the aqueduct, walkers have spotted diggers, an excavator and floating rubbish clearing barges in the river. Could something be happening at last?June 2The aqueduct has been cleared of rubbish — not a plastic bottle to be seen! A major clean-up operation successfully removed more than a ton of rubbish.I’m thrilled to see the site restored to its former beauty but saddened that it was very likely to be pressure from the Mail which made it happen, and at a staggering cost to the public purse.And still the job is only half done. Behind the prison the rubbish pile still mounts. Now there’s a door, a wooden palette, traffic cones all daubed in algae and buzzing with flies. A jogger stops, incredulous. ‘This is the worst litter I’ve ever seen,’ she says, ‘It’s like a landfill site. It’s vile.’It is so saddening that the Daily Mail’s fantastic Great Plastic Pick Up was able to galvanise communities across the country and generate a palpable sense of pride and responsibility for our public areas, but still, in some pockets of the country, random littering continues and remains choked by mind-numbingly, impenetrable bureaucracy to spoil all our best intentions — and scar our beautiful land.Postscript, June 2A call from the Canals And Rivers Trust with the best possible news — a joint clean up with the Environment Agency HAS been arranged for behind the prison. A two-week project will start on Tuesday and last up to two weeks. It is expected to load six or seven two-ton wagons with plastic trash which will be taken away to be sorted and recycled.My work here is done."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/10/4CCE884900000578-0-image-m-20_1527844937400.jpg","title":"Wales grandmother Ann Mayer coughing 35 years","story":"    Ann Mayer, 76, (pictured) started coughing when she was 40 years old and hasn\u0027t stoppedFury as \u0027draconian\u0027 school bans packed lunches, offers Halal...Former pupil at £38,000-a-year Charterhouse who was accused...Share this articleMrs Mayer, a soprano in St Asaph Choral Society, said: \u0027I started coughing when I was 40 years old, completely out of the blue. \u0027One minute I was fine, the next I had a tickle and a splutter...

She said: \u0027I started singing at 14 years old as a soprano and it has been my life-long passion.\u0027But things are now so bad that when we perform, which is mainly in cathedrals, I have to stand at the end, near to a pillar, so I can hide behind it when I start coughing, as once it starts it\u0027s sometimes hard to stop.

If you’re a small business you may not go in every week, but you will still need to go in for a serious discussion about a loan.’ When they shut a branch, banks must reveal how many customers rely on it under industry rules. They typically say the branches have only a handful of regular customers and are no longer cost-effective.But NatWest owner RBS classes a customer as regular only if they have been in for 23 weeks of the past 26.Lloyds’ criteria are even more restrictive, at 48 weeks out of 52 weeks each year.This means even someone who went in every week apart from Easter, Christmas and a two-week summer holiday may not be classed as regular customers.These definitions rule out many thousands of people who pop into a branch only once every couple of weeks – even though a branch closure would severely limit their access to basic services. It is also thought the figures count only those who make a transaction, meaning anyone who visits a branch for advice or information may not be included.          NatWest last month shut its branch in the busy town of Harpenden in HertfordshireDerek French, a former campaigner against unnecessary branch closures, who lives nearby, said: ‘It’s a baffling decision and the figures they quote are totally misleading.‘People here have voted with their feet and signed up with other banks instead.’ Mr French added that the decision struck him as a bad business move as well as damaging to customers.Local Tory MP Bim Afolami, had written to RBS boss Ross McEwan urging him to rethink the closure. He wrote: ‘This decision troubles me because of the number of thriving small and medium-sized businesses based here.‘Despite the shift towards online banking for personal current accounts, small and medium enterprises continue to rely on banking in branch.’ \u0027It\u0027s just so short-sighted\u0027Furious customers blasted Lloyds when it axed the last bank branch in town in Wilton, Wiltshire, as part of its drive to cut costs.It means users must travel almost four miles to Salisbury for basic banking – hitting shopkeepers as well as vulnerable elderly people who are unable to drive.In a statement justifying its decision to close the branch, Lloyds said it was used on a regular weekly basis by only 27 customers.          Lloyds has axed the last bank branch in town in Wilton, Wiltshire, to drive down costsHowever, the lender admitted that 260 people went in most months – and added that 241 customers used only the Wilton branch and had no other method of banking.When the closure was announced, town mayor Peter Edge said that bosses had helped kill the branch off by slashing its opening hours from five to three days a week in 2015.The move sparked protests from customers at the time.Councillor Edge added: ‘This is a terrible thing, as Wilton is on the up.

If you use a tumble dryer, it will consume more energy – which will cost more.’ The consumer group surveyed 1,199 washing machine owners and found 55 per cent use their quick wash ‘sometimes’ or ‘always’.          In 2011, the average standard wash time was about two hours, but now it is more than three hoursWhich? said it believed large numbers of people are using the quick wash because standard wash times are increasing.In 2011, the average standard wash time was about two hours, but now it is more than three hours.Which? said the reason standard washing cycles are getting longer relates to a theory from back in the 1960s called the ‘Sinner’s Circle’ and the need to cut down on energy consumption.While manufacturers compete to achieve an A+++ energy label, consumers are also looking to save money on their loads.Overall cleaning power is made up of five elements – temperature, detergent, spinning, water and time. If one element is decreased, another can be increased to achieve the same wash quality.Previous research by Which? found many washing machines fail to reach 60C on their 60C programmes.It said: ‘As heating the water is the most energy-intensive part, this suggests washing machine manufacturers are decreasing the temperature to cut down on energy consumption, but increasing the duration of the wash to get the same cleaning results.

The new government\u0027s plan to increase welfare spending could clash with EU budget rules. On Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker criticised Italy, saying its citizens should work more and be less corrupt.Italy has faced political instability for three months after inconclusive March elections, rocking financial markets and spreading unease among its euro partners.

Five...Italy lurches towards yet another poll if a ruling...Share this article    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini (pictured) was named interior minister He took control of the rightwing coalition that won the most votes in March\u0027s election when his League party surpassed ally Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia.Since taking over the old Northern League in 2013, Salvini has ridden a wave of public discontent, playing on anti-immigrant sentiment as he sought to shift the party\u0027s image from defender of the wealthy north against its \u0027parasite\u0027 south, to that of guardian of Italy\u0027s national sovereignty.Now he\u0027s heading into government with southerner Luigi Di Maio and the Five Star Movement, which picked up the vast majority of its seats in the south.Since Salvini took over the League, nearly 700,000 people have landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean sparking a sense of resentment among many Italians who feel Europe has abandoned them - a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                         In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals - which include a universal basic income for Italy\u0027s poorest, rolling back pension reform and a two tier flat tax - have worried Brussels and financial markets given the country\u0027s sizeable debt.  Italy\u0027s 2.3 trillion euros of debt is 132 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest ratio in Europe apart from Greece and more than double the bloc\u0027s 60-percent ceiling.The government programme includes plans to speed up expulsions of illegal immigrants and crack down on trafficking. The eurosceptic coalition also promises a series of measures to reign in the EU including renegotiation of EU treaties and a review of the bloc\u0027s economic governance on issues such as the single currency.  But on Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned against blaming the EU for all of Italy\u0027s problems.\u0027I\u0027m in deep love with Italy, Bella Italia. But I no longer accept that everything which is going wrong in South of Italy, in Mezzogiorno, is explained by the fact that the EU or the European Commission would not do enough,\u0027 he said after leaving a meeting in Brussels.\u0027Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.\u0027He urged Italy not to \u0027play this game\u0027 of holding the EU responsible, adding \u0027Nations first, Europe second.\u0027 Political neophyte Conte skipped teaching a class at the University of Florence to return to Rome after he was summoned to meet Mattarella at the presidential palace on Thursday night.            In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Carlo Cottarelli (pictured) announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/12/4CCE21F900000578-5794439-Samuel_Volery_broke_two_World_Records_in_Zurich_he_walked_a_tota-a-28_1527851849876.jpg","title":"Adrenaline junkies distance running new heights competing half marathon tightrope","story":"    So-called slackliners make their way between two tower blocks in Zurich, Switzerland.

The Photos were taken by a Russian journalist while Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met the North Korean dictator. It is not known if the meeting took place at this residence          From the atrium there is a far-reaching view down the driveway and out across the open countryside towards the mountains in the distance. Lavrov met with Kim while a former North Korean spy chief travelled to New York and met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in an attempt to salvage a summit between President Trump and KimThe two leaders are expected to sit down to negotiate the terms of North Korea\u0027s withdrawal from an effort to build a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States. The Russian photojournalist has also released pictures, taken at locations around Pyongyang, revealing unseen elements of day-to-day life inside the hermit kingdom.Although Kim has several palaces, pictures of them are hard to come by as the North Korean government has put in place tight security measures to make sure very few photographs exist. According to the tyrant\u0027s former bodyguard Lee Young-kuk, the North Korean leader keeps at least eight separate palaces outside the capital.During his visit, Lavrov  called for sanctions on North Korea to be lifted and invited Kim Jong-un for a meeting in Moscow as he met with the dictator in Pyongyang on Thursday.Sergei Lavrov was welcomed with open arms by Kim as he flew into the hermit kingdom in an apparent bid to curry favour ahead of a potential  summit between North Korea and the US.\u0027It is absolutely obvious that, as we start discussions on how to resolve the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, it is understood that the solution cannot be comprehensive without the lifting of sanctions,\u0027 Lavrov said in a press conference.He also urged the state to hold off on relinquishing their nuclear weapons until tangible action had been taken to lift the economic stranglehold.           Inside, the palace is simply decorated with neutral colours bedecking every wall and very few paintings displayed through the house          The gardens are dominated by an enormous water feature which sprays jets from a fountain over several ornate dolphin sculptures Women throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetChilling moment gang carry drunk and \u0027drugged\u0027 girl from clubShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageBizarre moment pub flower seller puts her hand down woman\u0027s topCrowds gather for Free Tommy Robinson protest in LeedsPeter Wohlleben talks about his book The Hidden Life of TreesPolice at the scene of stabbing of two police officers in GreenockLush Cosmetics new \u0027anti-spy cops\u0027 campaign has been criticisedLottery winners give over two thirds of their fortune awayAngry mob confront prostitutes accused of pickpocketing Brit tourists\u0027This cannot be achieved at one go\u0027, he added. \u0027There can be no immediate denuclearisation, this should be done step by step and all sides should go half-way during every single phase of this process\u0027. The meeting was the first ever between the North Korean leader and a Russian official - and Lavrov used the opportunity to invite Kim for a return fixture in Moscow.\u0027Come to Russia, we\u0027ll be very happy to see you,\u0027 Lavrov told Kim in remarks released by the Russian foreign ministry.Last month, North Korea\u0027s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho held rare talks with Lavrov in Moscow as Pyongyang moves to improve strained ties with global powers.  Lavrov passed greetings from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Kim, saying he wished him success in the \u0027major undertakings that have been initiated on the Korean peninsula\u0027, the ministry said in a statement. Secretary of State Pompeo meets top North Korean official...Kim Jong Un complains of U.S. \u0027hegemonism\u0027 to Russia\u0027s...Russia calls for North Korea sanctions to be lifted as...Share this article    The tyrant certainly seems to be a fan of high culture as there are several intricate sculptures scattered all around the vast property          The photographers other photos from his trip show North Korean locals in the capital going about their day-to-day business          The photojournalist was allowed access to the state as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Pyongyang to discuss a potential upcoming Singapore summit with KimWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlChilling moment gang carry drunk and \u0027drugged\u0027 girl from clubMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageBizarre moment pub flower seller puts her hand down woman\u0027s topLottery winners give over two thirds of their fortune awayPeter Wohlleben talks about his book The Hidden Life of TreesPolice at the scene of stabbing of two police officers in GreenockCrowds gather for Free Tommy Robinson protest in LeedsLush Cosmetics new \u0027anti-spy cops\u0027 campaign has been criticisedAngry mob confront prostitutes accused of pickpocketing Brit touristsThe meeting between Lavrov and Kim lays bare Russia\u0027s desire to involve itself in diplomatic relations between North Korea and the US ahead of a potential summit. President Trump and Kim had planned to meet in  Singapore for a meeting on June 12 to discuss the potential for denuclearisation and greater cooperation between North and South Korea.Efforts are currently underway to restore the plans after Trump dramatically announced he was pulling out of the summit in a letter to Kim in May. Kim\u0027s right hand man General Kim Yong Chol flew into New York on Wednesday to try and salvage the assembly.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted photos of his working dinner with Kim\u0027s right-hand man in New York on Wednesday.Kim Yong Chol met with Pompeo in Manhattan, where the two dined on \u0027steak, corn, and cheese,\u0027 according to the secretary of state. He is the most senior North Korean official to visit the United States since 2000, when Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok traveled to Washington to meet with then-President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. Pompeo\u0027s talks with Kim Yong Chol - the most critical of three tracks of negotiations currently taking place between the two governments in the U.S., in the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone, and in Singapore - are aimed at determining whether a meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un can be restored.

If you’re a small business you may not go in every week, but you will still need to go in for a serious discussion about a loan.’ When they shut a branch, banks must reveal how many customers rely on it under industry rules. They typically say the branches have only a handful of regular customers and are no longer cost-effective.But NatWest owner RBS classes a customer as regular only if they have been in for 23 weeks of the past 26.Lloyds’ criteria are even more restrictive, at 48 weeks out of 52 weeks each year.This means even someone who went in every week apart from Easter, Christmas and a two-week summer holiday may not be classed as regular customers.These definitions rule out many thousands of people who pop into a branch only once every couple of weeks – even though a branch closure would severely limit their access to basic services. It is also thought the figures count only those who make a transaction, meaning anyone who visits a branch for advice or information may not be included.          NatWest last month shut its branch in the busy town of Harpenden in HertfordshireDerek French, a former campaigner against unnecessary branch closures, who lives nearby, said: ‘It’s a baffling decision and the figures they quote are totally misleading.‘People here have voted with their feet and signed up with other banks instead.’ Mr French added that the decision struck him as a bad business move as well as damaging to customers.Local Tory MP Bim Afolami, had written to RBS boss Ross McEwan urging him to rethink the closure.

If the sun sets in the evening with a rosy glow, then there is likely to be sunshine the following morning.The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the West as they do in the UK.So, if it’s fine in the West, then beams from the sun — as it sets in that direction— can stream unhindered through the clear skies and light up any clouds drifting off to the East.Meanwhile, the saying, ‘red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’ is also usually right. A red sky appears early in the day as a result of the high-pressure weather system having already moved east. This means the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a windy low-pressure system and rain — falling on the shepherds’ flocks.PLANT PREDICTORSWhen the air gets humid in the hours before rain, many wild-flowers protectively close their petals.Typical are daisies. If the white petals are closed and you cannot see the yellow middle disc, it is not wise to hang out your washing.WHY STEMS SNAPMost plants are naturally stable enough to withstand heavy rainfall.However, so many varieties that we grow in modern gardens are unnaturally made to grow faster by being given artificial fertiliser. This leads to tall, fragile stems that are insufficiently woody. It is little wonder that they snap easily under stress.ALL HAIL A STORMYou can learn a lot about the life-story of a hailstone by slicing it in half.It has a layered structure similar to the rings in tree trunks — both showing their age. Hailstones are formed in storm clouds. As they are pulled up several miles into the sky by strong wind currents, more water accumulates on their outsides and they freeze, making them bigger.When the strength of the wind drops in the highest altitudes, the hailstones fall back down into the stormy zone, where the updraught again thrusts them upward.Each time they do this they get bigger until, finally, they become too heavy to be kept in the air by wind currents and they drop to the ground.Each layer of ice is created by a single ‘up and down’ journey through the storm cloud. For example, five rings correspond to five loops of this natural rollercoaster.THE BEAK-ING CLOCKEvolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned out.So, in order to warn off rivals, or to woo a mate, different species tend to start at different times in the morning.The skylark begins while it’s still dark — one and a half hours before sunrise. Next, redstarts begin their chorus.    Evolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned outBlackbirds then perform exactly one hour before sunrise, with chiffchaffs following 30 minutes later.Then, as the sun appears on the horizon, all the birds join in the dawn chorus. From then on, if you want to determine the time without aid of a watch, you’ll need to turn your attention to flowers.ANT AND TREKHave you ever puzzled over why flowers that have grown for years in a certain area of your garden suddenly appear in another part the following spring? It may be because ants picked up the seeds to gorge on fleshy, oil-rich appendages (called elaiosomes) which are found on some seeds and then they drop them up to 90 feet away from the parent plant.Plants which make use of this free delivery service include wild strawberries, dog violets, wild garlic, dead-nettles and forget-me-nots.WATERING TIPSBritain averages 133 days of rain or snow a year, totalling 885 millimetres.Plants adapt to deal with these downpours in different ways. Watch, for example, how, when it rains, rhubarb uses its large, funnel-shaped leaves to catch the water and guide it down its stems to the roots. The same technique is used by dandelions.Water management in your gardens depends on the soil type. Sandy soils allow a lot of water to trickle into the deeper layers, meaning that the groundwater is well replenished, but plants can dry out quickly. On the other hand, loamy soils — a mixture of sand, silt and clay — retain moisture from which plants benefit even over long periods with low levels of rainfall.There is a simple trick for checking whether your soil is sufficiently moist: push aside the humus (the brownish black matter on top, usually just one to two centimetres deep) until you see the pure soil.Press a clump of this between your index finger and thumb. If it sticks together, it is moist enough. But if it crumbles as soon as you release your fingers, it is too dry.Of course, you can provide remedial action by watering — but don’t mollycoddle your plants by watering your garden every day. By over-watering, they get used to having moisture around their roots and spread them out close to the surface.The fact is that plants thrive when they have to make an effort to find water and therefore grow much deeper roots. By doing so, they can always meet at least part of their fluid requirements even when the topsoil has dried out. The best solution during dry periods is to drench plants thoroughly. This simulates natural precipitation and ensures the water reaches the plants’ lower roots.Since the plant then has no incentive to direct its roots upwards, this encourages resilience and allows you to go away for a fortnight without your entire garden drying out.CLUES IN THE CLOUDSThe presence of condensation trails of aeroplanes (called ‘contrails’) are an early sign of bad weather.If these don’t dissolve, it means humidity is on its way and the sky will soon cloud over. The movement of real clouds also gives clues.As a rule of thumb, the weather will always change when clouds are moving in a different direction to the direction of the wind at ground level.Tall, towering clouds on the horizon herald rain. And clouds puffed out at the top, or forming an anvil shape, mean a thunderstorm is on the way.INSECT INDICATORSThe behaviour of creatures in your garden will give you a good idea of the temperature. At 0c many cold-blooded insects have a form of anti-freeze in their circulation systems to stop them being affected by the cold. This means they are happy to fly around at temperatures just over zero degrees.For example, ladybirds and winter crane flies (also known as winter midges) produce the chemical compound glycerol, a substance once used in car anti-freeze, to stop themselves getting too cold.          When spring temperatures reach 5c, it is the trigger for toads and frogs to start spawning.Bees only leave the hive at temperatures above 12c. Also, you’ll never hear the chirping (technically called stridulating) of grasshoppers and crickets below 12c.Honey bees cluster together in hives in the winter, maintaining a core temperature of 25c.They manage to maintain this level with the energy provided from their stores of honey.TELL THE TIME, PETALDifferent plants open their flowers at different points in the day.Pumpkins and courgettes (both from the cucurbits family of plants) kick things off by opening their flowers at 5am. From 8am, marigolds spread out their golden petals and daisies follow at 9am.When the sun’s at its peak at noon, the bedding plant Mesembryanthemum opens its blossoms.Between 2pm and 3pm, after a morning’s work, dandelions start to close their heads, and by 3pm, gourd flowers have finished for the day.After doing the longest shift, poppies shut up shop at around 6pm.But it’s after sunset that certain flowers open, attracting flying pollinators — such as moths — which are on the wing for a sip of nectar at this late hour.Many plant species have adopted this late-opening strategy, including evening primrose.Others remain open all day but only start to emit their seductive aromas after dusk — common soapwort and the perennial phlox among them.If you like to sit outside on a warm summer evening, plant a few specimens of these night bloomers in your favourite spot.You’ll be well rewarded by the opportunity to observe some shy visitors, including many you may have never seen before.FEATHER FORECASTERSThe ancient saying, ‘when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry’ is not accurate. In fact, swallows fly higher than normal when the wind picks up before a storm.A much better guide to weather changes is the chaffinch (Britain’s seventh most common species of bird). It has an idiosyncratic way of warning us. In fine weather, males usually trill a melody that goes ‘chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo’.However, if rain is imminent, it sounds a monosyllabic ‘raaatch’.FLIGHT RISKSMoths orientate themselves by flying at a constant angle to the Moon.Unfortunately, they often confuse artificial street lights and domestic light-bulbs for the lunar glow.Sadly, they often crash into these man-made lights and are killed.Inevitably, predators have taken advantage. On warm summer nights, bats cleverly patrol street-lamps in the hope of easy pickings.If you want to help save insects from such a fate, close your blinds and curtains as soon as you switch on your lights after dark so as to reduce the artificial glare through your windows.The same applies to lights in your garden, which attract spiders and woodlice.SMELLING DANGERResearchers have recently discovered that plants talk to one another via ‘scent messages’.Trees, for example, warn each other about insect attacks by giving off a chemical distress signal. This is the cue for others of the same species to produce defensive chemicals that are then stored in their bark ready to give off themselves if necessary.Similarly, plants emit warning signals when under stress — for example when they are lacking food or water. Conversely, when happy with their location and have enough food, pine trees give off a sweet, aromatic fragrance.

How do we stay positive and fight for change? Here they reveal the books that give them hopeThe Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton is the sanest and funniest book I’ve ever read. It was first published in 1621, and has been in print ever since. How can a hundred words do justice to this marvel of deep human sympathy, exquisite psychology, and rough good sense? Open any of its thousand or more pages at random and you’ll find better advice and consolation, and more sheer life-giving energy, than anyone else has ever managed to muster. And it’s unfailingly funny. Where else will you find a description of palm trees falling in love? This is the book I want beside me for the rest of my life.• Philip Pullman’s The Book of Dust Vol 1: La Belle Sauvage is published by David Fickling.The Language of Kindness: A Nurse’s Story may be a strange choice, as I was often moved to tears by some of the desperately ill patients Christie Watson writes about in her beautiful memoir – but it’s so wise, so compassionate, so honest that I find it uplifting. It gives me hope for our overstretched National Health Service – with nurses like Christie, who understand the importance of simple kindness, the world seems a better place. She was a truly dedicated nurse, and is currently a brilliant, award-winning writer.• Jacqueline Wilson’s Rose Rivers (Hetty Feather series) is published by Doubleday Children’s.Set in Harlem in the 1920s, Jazz, by Toni Morrison, is a novel with no shortage of heartache and sorrow and violence. It knows there is injustice in the world and that everything will most certainly not be OK in the end. Why then does it give me hope? Because it’s such a miracle of a novel – generous, imaginative, sexy, human and often joyful. Sometimes art is a solace simply by virtue of being so very good that we know how fortunate we are simply to exist in the world alongside it.• Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire is shortlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction.Recently I have been translating Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince. It was an extraordinarily life-affirming and joyful experience. I knew the book, had skimmed it often. But to translate was to delve deep, to lose oneself utterly in the mysteries of the story, into the music of the language, to try to under-stand every nuance. The best of humankind is in the character of the Little Prince: the kindness, the oddness, the endless inquisitiveness, the genius of creativity. There is a tenderness about the relationship between the aviator who has crash-landed in the desert and this strange human being that is so telling and touching. I know no character in fiction whom I would rather meet and talk to than the Little Prince. To be with him would be to get to know oneself better, to think more deeply, to see the world with fresh eyes, to live in new hope.• Michael Morpurgo’s In the Mouth of the Wolf is published by Egmont.The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. The hopelessness of character assassination and being trapped by evil people’s lies is something I know a little about. I fell in love with Edmond Dantès and his quest for justice long ago. Dumas’s writing helped form me. I wish I could thank him in person, but this will have to do.• Rose McGowan is an actor, activist and author of Brave, published by HQ.A Sentimental Journey by Laurence Sterne is a book I return to every few years and I am always delighted by it. The title is perhaps a bit misleading to us in the 21st century. To our ear “sentimental” suggests something a little contrived and manipulative, but A Sentimental Journey seems to me to be above all honest, and from that honesty comes a profoundly moving and exquisitely funny book. Yorick is such a recognisable character, so modern, that perhaps the opening line, “They order, said I, this matter better in France –” can give us hope that even now, 250 years later, we can still engage with the continent in a spirit of joy.• Jim Broadbent is an actor and co-author of graphic novel Dull Margaret with artist Dix, published by Fantagraphics.There are many books that give me hope, but the one book that I have carried with me wherever I go is Illuminations by Walter Benjamin. Benjamin is a fascinating writer, very difficult to place in any category. In some ways he is the son of his time, of a certain place and a moment in history. But in other ways he is timeless and placeless. A perpetual nomad, a dedicated flâneur. So many of the questions he raised are relevant, universal and remarkably timely today. Benjamin was aware that one might have lots of information about a particular subject, and yet might still have zero wisdom. We are bombarded by nuggets of information but that does not mean “knowledge” or “wisdom”. Benjamin’s work was strikingly interdisciplinary, his curiosity endless, his mind sharp and his soul open to hope and melancholy, faith and doubt. Reading and rereading Walter Benjamin will give us a clever kind of hope, one that understands the challenges of the world and has confidence in humanity nevertheless.• Elif Shafak’s Three Daughters of Eve is published by Penguin.For me, the true receptacles of hopefulness are those books that do not have recourse to the magical thinking involved in the various systems of belief. Gratitude, by Oliver Sacks, comprising a quartet of achingly poignant, coolly non-sentimental and beautifully concise pieces from the closing months of his life, projects an inspiringly powerful sense of equanimity in the face of dissolution. It induces an irresistible appreciation of the privilege of being alive and of the true hope that comes from an awareness that all the consolation for the trials and tribulations of our lives is to be found in a deep engagement in life itself.• Akram Khan is professor of experimental particle physics and high performance computing, Brunel University London.This century feels like the End of Days. Terror, pity and exasperation crowd our minds. To whom or to what, then, can we turn to find hope? To the self, perhaps – and I don’t mean to the “selfie” we show off to others, but rather to the reflective, inner being who pays close attention to how a well-lived life might unfold. For guidance, read Sarah Bakewell’s clear-sighted distillation of Michel de Montaigne’s essays, How to Live, a wise and beautiful book I keep by my bedside. Via many endearing digressions and changes of heart, Montaigne talks to all our human fears and guides us towards freedom from our habitual “inanity and nonsense”.• Rose Tremain’s Rosie: Scenes from a Vanished Life is published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus.One of my favourite books and a constant in my life is The Famished Road by Ben Okri. It’s the tale of a young boy, Azaro, who is both lost and not lost in the spirit world and in the real world. I love the journey between the two dimensions, which combines a sense of mystery, a beautiful insight into and exploration of West African culture, while connecting you with a sense of wonder. Okri is my guru – a mentor who is able to take the simple truths and realities of life and realise them in stories and words that leave you breathless.• Laura Mvula is a singer-songwriter whose album The Dreaming Room won an Ivor Novello award.Great poetry continues to speak to the reader long after the death of the poet. WH Auden’s work continues to speak to those who choose to listen he changes the way we see things and offers hope. “In Memory of Sigmund Freud” is one of the most comforting pieces of poetry I know. It is about freedom and the ability to be ourselves – and the corrosive and limiting effects of repression and hate. He also wrote the poignant lullaby that begins “Lay your sleeping head, my love …” The moment I took a copy of Auden’s Collected Shorter Poems off the shelves in the university library, on impulse, was a moment of literary discovery I’ve learned many lessons from his sympathetic understanding of the world and I carry this collection around with me always.• Alexander McCall Smith’s The No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.I knew only a little about the artist Walter Spies until I read John Stowell’s Walter Spies: A Life in Art. Its combination of narrative, photographs, reproductions of paintings and long quotations from Spies’s eloquent letters reveals a fascinating character, an equally brilliant pianist, painter and linguist. Despite spending six of his 46 years imprisoned (because he was always on the wrong side of history), Spies altered the cultural landscape of Bali in the 1930s, working with local artists, creating great paintings, making music, and finding happiness even in prison cells. This book on his brief, dazzling life makes me hope that times as grim as the present will pass, and may even leave something good behind.• Anuradha Roy’s All the Lives We Never Lived is published by MacLehose.There’s something about the anti-sparkle aesthetic of Junichiro Tanizaki’s In Praise of Shadows that fills me with deep hope. Rather than look at the world through binaries of darkness and light, he sings of the glories of murk. And as we live in decidedly murky times, it would be better for us to get used to the “glow of grime”, to navigate our way by finding softness where we can – the warmth of a lacquer cup in our hands, a face in candlelight. His is a call to slowness, an investigation into the sources of illumination rather than the exterior shine, reminding us that beauty is in the shadows.• Tishani Doshi’s Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods is published by Bloodaxe.Women \u0026amp Power: A Manifesto by Mary Beard packs a powerful punch in its 115 pages. Beard guides the reader through the ancient, deep roots of misogyny and explores how women through the ages have managed to break the (imposed) silence. Her promise of a “manifesto” does not disappoint. Practical calls to action are made, most importantly the demand that power must be redefined if women do not fit into the heteropatriarchal model so dominant for the last few millennia. I write this as Ben Broadbent, deputy head of the Bank of England, described the UK economy as “menopausal”. Reducing women to whether we menstruate or not – and linking that to “economic productivity” – is blatantly sexist. Women \u0026amp Power gives me hope that there is a solution for gender inequality in the future – by firmly kicking it into the past.• Amy Lamé’s From Prejudice to Pride: A History of the LGBTQ+ Movement is published by Wayland.The more one travels the more the experience dulls in novelty. The Wonders of Vilayet: Wonderful Tales about Europe by Mirza Sheikh I’tesamuddin (translated by Kaiser Haq) makes one see the world through the honest eyes of a Muslim traveller in 1766, who undertook an extraordinary journey over sea. He left India as part of an embassy from the Mughal emperor Shah Allam II to the British court as its Persian scribe, or munshi. His description of Britain is totally fresh – it allows the reader to rethink the familiar, but also to consider how cultural exchanges between east and west were central to the making of our modern world. • Sujit Sivasundaram is a historian at Cambridge University. Rage Becomes Her by Soraya Chemaly will be published in September. It might seem strange to say that a book about women’s rage is the one that gives me most hope. But this book makes me hopeful because it is a rallying battle cry that underscores the fury of women that has been unleashed over the past year. It acknowledges the potent and justified sources of women’s rage and I hope it heralds the beginning of a new dawn where that anger is heard, and real change happens as a result.• Laura Bates is co-founder of the Everyday Sexism Project and author of Misogynation, published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster.WG Sebald’s Autserlitz is dark, lyrical, moving, and at times simply ruthless in its manner of probing how we live in the wake of time. Time undoes us, and we do not always understand why it is that time is not so much about memory as it is ultimately about death. We look at the past, he seems to say, not because we long for it, but because it helps us avoid what lies in wait for us.• André Aciman’s Enigma Variations: A Novel is published by Picador.I was born here, but do I really belong? The appalling treatment of Caribbean people who arrived here as children intensified my feelings of uncertainty. However, in my parents’ homelands, I am also an outsider. The beautiful, powerful The Wine of Astonishment by Earl Lovelace drew me into my mother’s island, Trinidad. It is social history viewed through the eyes of wise, empathetic Eva Dorcas, the wife of community and church leader Bee. In 1917, the colonial government banned Shouter Baptist worship, devastating community, identity and family relationships. It is a book about masculinity, betrayal, faith and colonialism. However, it is also about love, sacrifice and hope. When Bee can publicly preach again, he believes the Spirit has left him. He and his family leave the church and pass young men playing steelpan. “I watch Bee, Bee watch me ... the both of us bow, nod, as if, yes, God is great, and like we passing in front of something holy.”• Patrice Lawrence’s Indigo Donut is published by Hodder Children’s Books.The Life Before Us, a novel by the French writer Romain Gary published in 1975, is an ode to the two most important things in life: unselfish love and the powerful force of imagination. The narrator is Momo, an Arab boy brought up by an elderly Jewish lady, a survivor of the Holocaust and former prostitute. It is through his innocent, philosophical mind, a sort of naive intelligence, that the author conveys his vision of history, human existence and the paradoxes that make us human.• Audur Ava Ólafsdóttir’s Hotel Silence is published by Pushkin.Euripides’s Helen, first produced in 412BCE, takes the old Homeric storylines – “foreign boy meets married girl, huge war ensues, husband and wife get back together again” – and reinvents them in ways that are both playful and profound, as a happy-ending escape tragedy starring a Helen who never went to Troy in the first place. I find the play inspiring because it demonstrates so clearly how great works of literature can take on new meanings in different cultural moments, inviting us to relish the thrilling multiplicity of stories.• Emily Wilson’s new translation of The Odyssey is published by WW Norton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e9d53288234dfbb8f5331cfa37e7561dc49a78/0_224_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f2d8929039c0e6af3de5e8be6d8d2c2","title":"simon armitage made in mardsen","story":"I grew up in the West Yorkshire village of Marsden at the head of the Colne Valley, a close-knit community of about four thousand people high in the Pennines, last stop before Lancashire. It was an uninterrupted and in some ways uneventful childhood.As a consequence there was always a tendency to magnify the smaller details and on those rare occasions when something truly dramatic happened – a suspicious death, a sexual scandal, a mill burning down – those incidents became the stuff of fantasy and mythology. My first poems were about Marsden, and my latest collection contains pieces that reference the village, either directly or indirectly.The family home was a small end-terrace on the side of the hill, and despite not living there for 30 years my bedroom window in that house still operates as a lens and framing device. I’d lie in bed watching the nocturnal comings and goings in the streets below, even keeping a logbook of activity as people spilled out from the pub at closing time and articulated lorries pulled up for the night in the area of wasteland opposite the New Inn. The evidence of all kinds of skulduggery is probably set down in those pages, though recorded in innocence.One night the back garden was suddenly flooded by a car’s headlights, and a man in a tuxedo and bow tie made his way towards the dilapidated greenhouse. It was my dad, back late after singing in a concert, watering his tomatoes before turning in, wading through slow summer air thick with floating seeds and drowsy insects. In that projected illumination he looked like a black and white movie star.Even in Marsden the extraordinary could happen, apparently. Staring out of that window every night I developed a new sense of the world, one that went beyond the factual and the informational. A sense of what it was like, and how it felt. That was the beginning of my life as a writer, even though I still didn’t know how to capture experiences in words. To people passing through, either on the A62 or the Leeds-Manchester train (aboard the cruelly named “Pennine Sprinter”), Marsden actually looks like a small town, not least because of the big textile mills. But its mentality is very much that of a rural village.Sheep amble down the main street. Around its circumference the hills and escarpments stand far taller than the architecture, and the mills are rotting carcasses waiting for some future purpose. Also, nine tenths of Marsden is sky and moor. From my parents’ house I could turn right and make my way along the valley to Huddersfield, where me and a few like-minded souls would attempt to be bohemian, writing poems in the Merrie England Coffee Houses and trying to get served in the least frightening pubs. Or I could turn left and be in the middle of nothing and nowhere, with no one else for miles.The moors can be dangerous. People go up there, get lost and don’t come back. But they are also enticing and beguiling spaces, pages waiting to be written. I have a poem inscribed in a quarry at the side of Pule Hill, the landmark vantage point above the village when working on ancient homecoming narratives like Homer’s Odyssey and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Marsden has played a part, not so much in what I think but how I think.I live a few miles away now, in the leafier, cushier, lotus-eating Holme Valley, but in winter, from the roof window in my study, I can see Marsden looking back at me from the horizon.• Flit is published by Yorkshire Sculpture Park.

He took on the business from his 93-year-old father Ronnie, a second world war D-day veteran who set it up in an arch 60 years ago.“At the time Network Rail couldn’t get rid of the arches, they just wanted people to come in and look after them,” Grant said. “When my father moved in there were three light bulbs and that was it, so he set about renovating it and they said do what you want as long as you pay your rent.“They have absolutely never looked after us. We have built a business in those arches to serve the community.“These businesses are the lifeblood of the communities of this country but Network Rail don’t understand this. They are basically exterminating the small business entrepreneurs in this country. “With this sale of the assets nobody has been consulted. The government just said we are going to sell the arches. There was no consultation with the tenants or the general public. And the public don’t want their local businesses to be exterminated, because they use them.”This story is being repeated across the country, leaving business owners facing an uncertain future.Dipak Patel, 39, runs a cafe and repair shop called Popup Bikes in Manchester with his brother Prakash, but is facing the threat of having to pack up and leave if his three-month rolling lease ends.He said: “It’s how big business works. It’s what they do, in search of profits the little guy gets shoved to the side.“The important thing here is the public know this is going on and how it will affect them in the future. What will it leave them with in their cities and towns? What will happen if the nice independent coffee shop that used to be there will get replaced by a multinational chain?“We are a hub for the community. Before we came in six years ago there were just smackheads hanging around. People couldn’t even park their cars here but now they can as the whole area has improved. But all that will go out the window if we are forced to leave.“What we will end up with is a monoculture where there are no Popup Bikes, no great MOT places, just the same big chains everywhere. There will be no choice and we just have to buy the same stuff that everyone else buys.”According to reports, there are said to be around 20 parties interested in the £1.2bn rail property arm, including private equity firms Terra Firma and Blackstone.But s of the Arches says momentum is starting to build and they have gained 3,500 signatures in just one week on a letter addressed to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, which they plan to deliver to Downing Street this month.Leni Jones, 38, whose husband Marcus established Rosso Corse, London’s only Ducati service centre, which is based in Bethnal Green, said they feel like they are being held to ransom by Network Rail.Jones acts as a director of s of Arches after being told Rosso Corse’s rent increase almost fourfold.“We feel we are being held to ransom, they’ve given us zero time to relocate and they’ve removed all our security by taking away our security of tenure. And they own all the arches so they control the entire market,” she said.“We’re not opposed to rent reviews, but what they are proposing is not comparable to what is charged locally. The business is our baby and what it represents to us is the culmination of my husband’s journey and all the love we’ve put into it.“This is where the concept came from, we shouldn’t be facing Network Rail alone, we should pool this knowledge and speak as a group. We’ll happily sit down and negotiate.”A spokesman said: “The sale of Network Rail’s arches will enable the company to raise funds to reinvest in much-needed railway projects to expand and improve the railway network for the benefits of millions of daily users.“Rent reviews happen as tenancies expire, which can be as long as seven years. We benchmark against similar commercial premises in the local area and aim our rents at the lower end to make them competitive. “Some areas have seen marked regeneration in recent years, which can lead to increased rents but we will always do our best to stagger any increase.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c69076e997e030e8ae66de8509f7dedf7a062201/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ec94e43b7ccf37a08ab853cdf0740159 1320w","title":"middle aged alcohol drink historic","story":"Recently I calculated that every year I drink about 100 times as much alcohol as my father did, and at least 200 times as much as my mother. The annual total in dad’s case came at most to a dozen small bottles of beer plus a whisky at New Year, while over the same 12 months Mum might have two or three glass of advocaat mixed with lemonade, and at New Year a couple more of sherry. These tiny amounts have to be measured against my own domestic intake of getting on for three bottles of wine a week, or let’s say 150 bottles a year, which takes no account of the uncertain number swallowed outside the house at restaurants, farewell parties, funerals and the homes of friends.I console myself with the fact that I hardly ever drink spirits or beer, rather like the brandy-befuddled shepherd whom Richard Hannay meets in The Thirty-Nine Steps, who can’t understand his condition: the shepherd considers himself a teetotaller because he “keepit aff the whisky”. In truth, compared to the good and sober habits of my parents, my consumption is shameful. They would be worried by the ritual that occurs more evenings than not: the squeak of the corkscrew, the glug of wine into glass, the question: “Oh, shall we have another?” In their day, the alcohol that was kept in the house hardly ever left its little cupboard. A bottle of cognac and a bottle of Glenlivet, given to my grandparents at their wedding in 1899, lay there unopened. Slowly their gilt labels (“Bruce \u0026amp Glen, wine merchants, Dunfermline”) turned black with the passing years.I don’t think my mother was ever in a bar, and my father entered them only reluctantly after pressure from his workmates or brothers-in-law. We were a respectable family. Some fathers in the neighbourhood drank on a Saturday night. Others – “family men” – took their wives and children to the pictures. The typical Scottish bar hid behind painted or heavily curtained windows when the door swung open you glimpsed a forbidden interior of talkative men and tobacco smoke. Later, on the last bus home (from the Regal cinema, in my case, from the Volunteer Arms in his) one of these men might be sick, the yeasty liquid changing its course across the floor as the bus went up or down a hill. Or there would be someone in overalls – “still in his working clothes”, other passengers might say sorrowfully – who needed the conductor’s help to get down, having stayed in the pub till 10pm instead of going home to have tea with his wife.In the 1950s and 1960s it was possible to see scenes like these as the dwindling remnants of a darker past, when the industrial working class regularly anaesthetised themselves with beer and whisky, to add to the squalid chaos of their surroundings, the neglect of their children, the bruising of their wives, etc. Out of this time had come the temperance movement, which taught my mother as a schoolgirl to write “alcohol is a poison not a food” in her exercise books and equipped my 16-year-old father with an ornate certificate from the Christian charity Band of Hope on which he signed a pledge “to abstain from all intoxicating drinks as beverages” – the last two words presumably exempting a medicinal shot of brandy. “Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,” is inscribed between illustrations of women who sit draped and coiffured like Greek goddesses, one labelled Knowledge and the other Temperance, and each with a child at her knee.It’s easy to detect in this history a pattern of action and reaction – drunks in one generation, abstainers in the next – but in the last century larger forces were also at work. Youth movements such as the Scouts inveighed against drink. Other forms of entertainment, chiefly the cinema and the dance hall, began to change young men’s ideas of an evening out. In the interwar years, intellectual and physical pursuits such as night school classes, hiking and cycling became hugely popular: Charlie Chaplin and the Cyclists Touring Club probably did more to moderate alcohol consumption than the worldwide temperance movement. Male-only pleasures such as an evening in a pub began to look as quaint and outdated as the music hall. In the early 1960s, even in a Scottish provincial town, the coffee bar reigned as the fashionable place to meet and be seen.How, then, did we get from there to here – to a world in which 17-year-old girls develop pancreatitis as a result of excessive drinking, where, to quote its chief executive in England, the NHS is becoming the “national hangover service” but also to a world in which “overage drinkers”, people like me, are encouraged to change their habits.According to Drink Wise Age Well, a charity headquartered in Glasgow, harmful drinking is increasing more among the over-50s than any other age group. This week I watched a video put out by the charity that showed us either happy and careless or sad and heedless, drinking “a little more than we should” to cope with retirement, bereavement and the empty nest syndrome. A memorable little film that got through four lives and three different problems in 167 seconds. There was Kevin with his cans of lager “who didn’t think his long-anticipated retirement would leave him quite so bored”. There was Liz with her gin and tonic “increasingly isolated since losing her life partner Frank … once the life and soul of every party”. And there were Jackie and Derek, unloading their weekly half-dozen bottles of red from the boot of their little car and soon relaxing with full wine glasses “increasingly enjoying their evening tipple as the long evenings stretch out without the busy chirruping of family life”.There was a grim undertone of as yet undiagnosed diseases it seemed no coincidence that Frank, who died of bowel cancer, had liked a drink. As I watched, I noted with a little relief that Jackie and Derek were red wine boozers whereas I hardly ever stray from white. Then I made my calculation that suggested Dad drank only a 100th of what I do, and vowed to do better quite soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ed743457062d6f707123fbf1aa1b700690b20/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcf81e447b84c22ef2fc2ccb109776e","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1ad3c2a1f080684bed00f508ae332b5959183d/43_0_5671_3402/master/5671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ee8c57e3345b15d1351dea7dd9112a","title":"the joy of pints and pies how i learned to love uk holidays","story":"Travel writer Anna Hart on how she finally left her passport behind and learned to love holidaying at home in the UKFor most of my life, travel to me meant going as far as I could for as long as I could. I was a glutton for international trips, ticking off European cities I could visit in a weekend, backpacking around swathes of south-east Asia and Central America, and road-tripping across New Zealand and California. A relentless neophiliac, I firmly believed that “away” was intrinsically superior to “home”.It was a trip to New Zealand that planted the first seeds of doubt about my internationally-attuned travel palate. Campervanning around the islands, I realised that I’d been taking a lot of the delights of the UK for granted: our storied towns and villages the fact that long country walks can be bookended by pints and pies in historic pubs a public transport system that reaches into the peripheries our shark-free waters and uncrowded beaches. When enthusiastic UK-bound Kiwis would ask me for recommendations, I desperately wanted to be able to share insider tips beyond the three cities I’d lived in so far: Belfast, Glasgow and London.This experience gently encouraged me to view my homeland through the eyes of a tourist, and when I returned home, I launched Project UK. I began gently, with a day trip to the Somerset town of Bruton, where I wandered around the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery and stumbled upon a restaurant, At the Chapel, which I would cheerfully eat at every day. Next was a camping trip to Dorset, travelling entirely by public transport and drinking cider at the Square \u0026amp Compass. I swam off Shetland’s wild, deserted beaches I cycled the Kentish coastline, I rock-climbed in the Peak District, and then I realised that much of what I thought I had to travel for was right here on my doorstep.As well as pure pragmatism - saving time travelling, the absence of a time difference or jetlag, reducing my carbon footprint - there are a growing number of “pull factors” keeping me closer to home, stopping me from straying abroad.Embarking on a meaningful relationship with my home country - rather than flightily flouncing off for flings with far-flung destinations - has enriched my enjoyment of history, literature, music and art. These days I track different destinations and bands via Songkick so I can plan UK city breaks around gigs I want to go to - because Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh are some of the best cities in the world in which to catch a gig. I keep a rolling list of destinations that have, until now, only existed in my imagination – the Yorkshire moors that inspired my beloved Brontës, the lakes that I read about in the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, and, um, parts of the Northern Ireland coast that provide the backdrop for sex, blood and gore in Game of Thrones.It’s rewarding to bump into a Glaswegian and enthuse about the burgeoning culinary scene in Finnieston.

When you know the prices also you cannot compare with it.”The country is hoping that the shirt, with its eagle wing-inspired black-and-white sleeve and green torso, will help propel them to victory in their third consecutive World Cup.Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi and Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi were among the players who modelled the kit, first unveiled in February, alongside the away shirt – a “cool, refined vision” of the classic full-green strip – for the promotional photos.The makers said the away kit was a long-standing symbol of a nation that could boast of having “the world’s most expressive team”.Nigeria will wear their new shirt on Saturday in their World Cup warm-up game against England, who are expected to clock up a comfortable victory.However, with other Premier League stars representing the west African nation, including Leicester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho and Chelsea’s Victor Moses, the hosts will have to keep their eye on the ball, and off their opponents’ kit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e058a2ced9c05b08583a4fcaab8b2877dbf04c5/0_25_3157_1894/master/3157.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=677eb41f7c86ce9e60e3b5b46cb7c34a","title":"raheem sterling mothers boy jamaica man england","story":"Raheem Sterling once claimed his face was responsible for the criticism he has learned to dismiss during his years at Manchester City, Liverpool and England. “You know, when you see someone on TV and go, ‘I don’t like him’,” he explained. “Some people have that face, and I’ve got it.”This week it was his right leg. The outcry over a tattoo of an M16 assault rifle prompted a revealing response from the 23-year-old on Instagram, however. “When I was 2 my father died from being gunned down to death I made a promise to myself I would never touch a gun in my life time,” he wrote. “I shoot with my right foot so it has a deeper meaning.”Sterling never knew his father, who was killed in Jamaica, but says he has been inspired by him on the biggest occasions of his short career. It is his mother, Nadine, who he cites as the greatest influence, as well as his harshest critic.They emigrated from Kingston to England four years after Sterling’s absent father was murdered, and settled in Neasden, north-west London, where the gifted youngster played football in the shadow of Wembley stadium and attracted scouts from Queens Park Rangers. A tattoo of a young boy holding a football and looking up at the Wembley arch is etched on Sterling’s forearm. That one passed without national debate.Sterling was removed from mainstream education because of behavioural problems and spent three years at Vernon House special school, where his teacher, Chris Beschi, told him: “If you carry on the way you’re going, by the time you’re 17 you’ll either be playing for England or you’ll be in prison.” He was, Beschi said, “the kid in school who had a kind and innocent passion about him”.The winger was recruited by QPR as a 10-year-old, but his mother, worried about the influence of gang culture, resolved that he should leave London when scouts from leading Premier League clubs began to call. Arsenal, Chelsea and Fulham were all keen to sign Sterling, but location counted against them. That enabled Liverpool to secure his services, beating City to a deal. The club’s offer to QPR of £450,000, rising to £2m depending on progress, was instrumental in the move north.Frank McParland, former academy director at Liverpool, persuaded the Anfield club and then manager Rafael Benítez to sanction a sizeable outlay for an untested 15-year-old. Days after his arrival on Merseyside, Sterling made his debut for Liverpool in an under-18s game against local rivals Everton. Within minutes he was felled by a heavy challenge from the Everton left-back. McParland and Kenny Dalglish, watching from the sidelines, feared the worst for the slight teenager. Sterling rose to his feet, smiled at his larger opponent and clattered him back at the first opportunity.McParland says: “Raheem is relentless. He loves playing football and he has always been like that. When we used to do the fitness tests, he used to be the quickest and the fittest. So he would run the longest in the bleep test and also be the fastest. He is the best kid I have ever had. He blocks everything out to concentrate on the game and, if something doesn’t work for him, he’ll go again. You never see him hiding.”Sterling flourished at Liverpool. At 15 he appeared as a substitute in a pre-season friendly for Roy Hodgson’s team against Borussia Mönchengladbach. Dalglish, Hodgson’s replacement as manager, gave him three substitute appearances in the Premier League. At 17, and under another new manager, Brendan Rodgers, he made his full league debut at Anfield against Manchester City. A full England debut against Sweden followed three months later.Rodgers, a former youth academy coach at Chelsea and now Celtic manager, played an influential role in Sterling’s development, on and off the pitch. Alongside Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge, Sterling formed part of an exhilarating attack that almost took Liverpool to their first league title for 24 years in 2014.Rodgers had kept Sterling on his original £2,000-a-week contract for as long as possible at Liverpool. “There is one common denominator when it comes to young players falling by the wayside – money. It distorts reality, it changes people. I’m always cautious of that. I had Raheem playing for England and a regular in the Liverpool first team on £2,000 per week,” he said. “I stretched it out as long as I could.”The former Liverpool manager delivered an uncharacteristically public warning to the teenager when, having signed a new contract worth £35,000 a week, his form deteriorated. “He needs to stabilise his life, understand the remarkable opportunity he has at one of the biggest clubs in the world and focus everything on his career,” said Rodgers, after Sterling was cleared of assaulting a former girlfriend.A charge of common assault had also been dropped against Sterling earlier in 2013, but two court cases in quick succession prompted Rodgers to intervene. The player took the advice and, not for the first time, sought stability in a new location, moving from Liverpool to Southport. His mother moved with him before returning to London.Money and ambition were at the heart of Sterling’s orce from Liverpool. He and his agent, Aidy Ward, rejected a £100,000-a-week contract at Anfield while denying claims of greed in an interview with the BBC. After 123 games and 29 goals for Liverpool he was sold to City in 2015 for a fee rising to £49m – making him the most expensive English footballer ever at the time. The 23-year-old earns about £200,000 a week in Manchester and talks have opened over a new deal.Sterling is understandably wary of the media. “I can’t win,” he said, when reflecting on coverage of him eating a Greggs sausage roll while sitting in his limited edition Bentley – and public criticism has affected his performances for Liverpool, England and City. But he is open and articulate and extremely quick-witted when the guard comes down. He has a son, Thiago, with fiancée Paige Milian and a daughter, Melody Rose, from a previous relationship. The forward’s belief that his trophy cabinet would be enhanced at City has been vindicated. He lifted the League Cup at Liverpool’s expense in 2016 and this season, under the demanding guidance of Pep Guardiola, has produced the finest football of his career. Sterling scored 23 goals as City cruised to the Premier League title with a record 100 points. “He’s got bollocks,” said Hodgson, before the last World Cup in Brazil. The former England manager also cautioned Sterling that people “would stop looking for the benefits your game gives and start looking for the potential negatives”, words that ring true four years on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4f6d8808aae265a82f16ac5aeeae1609150128/0_157_4228_2536/master/4228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=824fa3caa1ef3de99a5099e32b64c6ea","title":"raheem sterling messed up england late show","story":"Gareth Southgate has let the forward know how serious his transgression was, with Sterling apologising to the squadThis time it is not so easy to defend the guy. It is not a witch-hunt, it is nothing to do with his choice of body art, where he shops or what he eats for breakfast and, if you happen to think Raheem Sterling is treated differently in parts of the media because of the colour of his skin, that does not change the fact he has genuinely messed up.At the same time there is no need to go overboard when Sterling, to give him his due, is hardly known for these late shows and Gareth Southgate has accepted it was a one-off – a disciplinary matter but still, ultimately, a one-off. Lessons learned, knuckles rapped and, according to the England manager, time to move on, no real damage done.The bottom line, however, is there is a world of difference between turning up late for England duty – necessitating an apology from Sterling in front of the entire squad – and the other stories that have ignited the recent debate about why he, of all Southgate’s players, appears to hold so much fascination for some of the more paparazzi-driven newspapers.Southgate’s response when he was asked about Sterling’s new tattoo of a rifle on his right leg was to defend the player and make it clear it was not an attempt to glamorise gangs or guns. The Football Association had already released a statement praising Sterling for the “honest and heartfelt account” in which the Manchester City player said the tattoo was unfinished and had a deeper meaning because his father was killed by a gun. Sterling has not been short of backing when, to many people, it has started to feel suspiciously as if there was something sinister about some of the coverage and, specifically, that it had become a campaign.That debate should not just be dismissed because Sterling could not manage to get to St George’s Park, as arranged, on Tuesday, turning up the following day instead and finding out in the process that Southgate, contrary to what some people believe, does have a temper. But the player has not done himself any favours and, if he was hoping for a period out of the limelight, it was probably not the wisest move to fly to Jamaica on holiday and then go awol when the rest of Southgate’s players were already preparing for Saturday’s game against Nigeria.As indiscretions go, this is not a man caught stealing flowers from his local cemetery but, in football terms, it does amount to a clear breach of discipline – one that would incense any top-level manager. As such, Sterling should be grateful Southgate has been so understanding. Was Sterling still in contention to play against Nigeria? “Absolutely,” the England manager replied. Yet not every manager would be so obliging and there are plenty of examples of players who have been left out as punishments for similar incidents.David Beckham turned up late at Manchester United once and, when he was asked to explain himself, he blamed it on his son, Brooklyn, being unwell. Sir Alex Ferguson decided that “wasn’t being fair to his team-mates” and he was dropped from the following game at Leeds. Beckham’s explanation did not wash: Ferguson recalled in one of his autobiographies that his player did not have “a satisfactory reason for being absent”.More recently Phil Foden, one of Sterling’s team-mates at Manchester City, and Jaden Sancho, of Borussia Dortmund, turned up late for a training session with England’s Under-19s before a game against Latvia. The manager, Paul Simpson, dropped them both.In Sterling’s case there are also aggravating circumstances, as far as Southgate is concerned, because he had already given the player an extra day off, with the rest of the squad reporting for duty last Monday. Sterling asked for extra time because he had a family problem during a week-long break for England’s players. He had a few days in Ibiza before flying back to deal with that matter. He then went to Jamaica on another holiday and the problem, according to the FA, was that he could not get a direct flight home. A connection was arranged via Miami and, for some reason, he did not make it.Southgate duly received an apologetic phone call on Tuesday night in which Sterling explained he would not be reporting for duty as planned. Whichever player it was, it would have warranted admonishment. It just happened to be Sterling: the man who has been in the headlines far more than he would have wanted over the last week.“I had a discussion with the player,” Southgate said. “We came to an agreement and then he, in fairness to him, wanted to apologise to the group, explained his commitment to the team, and it’s done.” Southgate, despite his reserved image, is not afraid to tell his players when they are out of line. “We went for a walk,” was his way of putting it.Ultimately, though, he will hope this is a storm that will quickly pass. There was no doubt he was unhappy – “We’d agreed he could have some extra time and he was late after the extra time” – but he also wanted it to be known Sterling was “absolutely” in his plans against Nigeria and, in his position, that was probably smart management, especially this close to a World Cup.Sterling should be grateful – indebted, even – to his manager’s leniency and that, for Southgate, is not a bad thing if it hardens the player’s resolve to pay him back on the pitch. Dropping him would have turned what should be a one-off incident into something Southgate insisted it never was – a crisis – and risked isions within the camp.“I have to say, he’s trained brilliantly all week,” Southgate noted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b18cf856d234203dd1022420347c06b970403a8/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc0b9726c650b29e86732afc3f8b8e6c","title":"blind date things got colin jenny karaoke","story":"Did Colin, 35, photographer, click with Jenny, 29, PR?What were you hoping for?A fun evening and a good story.First impressions?Jenny seemed nervous at first, but it didn’t take long for her to relax.What did you talk about?We both had our topics prepared, but they weren’t needed as the conversation flowed naturally.

I recently went on a trip to Tulum in Mexico, sailing there on the pages of Hartwood, a beautiful cookbook from an equally beautiful restaurant that’s set in a jungle and just across from a beach. I’ve borrowed ideas from the book for today’s first two dishes – both cooking and eating them takes me just a fraction closer to Tulum.This salsa pairs really well with all sorts of other things – roasted vegetables, grilled chicken or baked cubes of tofu, to name just a few – so double the amount if you like. It will keep in the fridge for two days.2 red romano peppers, stalks and seeds discarded, roughly chopped2 tomatoes, quartered and deseeded1 red chilli, cut in half lengthways and deseeded½ tsp chipotle chilli flakes (or smoked paprika)3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed4 limes, zest finely grated and juiced, to get 3 tbsp of each1 tbsp ground coriander1 tbsp ground cuminSalt100g pumpkin seeds, lightly toasted600g sustainably sourced skinless and boneless cod, cut into four equal pieces6 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped280g short-grain white rice500ml chicken stock5g coriander leaves, finely shreddedPut the first four ingredients in a food processor with one garlic clove, half the lime zest, a tablespoon of lime juice, half the ground coriander and cumin, and a teaspoon of salt. Blitz, then add the pumpkin seeds and blitz again to a coarse salsa.Put the cod in a large bowl and season with a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Pour over half the salsa, and toss with your hands to coat the fish. Put the rest of the salsa in a bowl, to serve. Leave the cod to marinate while you cook the rice.Heat the oven to 230C450Fgas 8. On a high flame, heat two tablespoons of oil in a large, high-sided ovenproof saute pan for which you have a lid. Add the remaining two garlic cloves, the remaining ground coriander and cumin, the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt, and fry for six to eight minutes, stirring now and then, until dark golden brown. Stir in the rice, stock, 80ml water, the remaining two teaspoons of lime zest and a tablespoon of lime juice. Cover the pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, until the rice is cooked. Don’t worry if it goes crisp at the bottom – this just adds to the texture and flavour.About halfway through cooking the rice, coat the cod pieces with the remaining two tablespoons of oil and arrange on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper. Bake for 10 minutes, until cooked through and beginning to crisp, then arrange the cod (and any juices on the tray) on top of the rice. Drizzle with the remaining lime juice, scatter over the coriander and serve with the remaining salsa on the side.Gurnard is a sustainable fish with a subtle flavour that is elevated by the camomile and aromatic oil red mullet would also work well.

Lay the fish on top, pour over the remaining cure, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for two to three hours.Meanwhile, make the cucumber water. Cut off and set aside a quarter of the cucumber. Roughly chop the rest and put in a blender with all the other ingredients and a teaspoon of flaked salt. Blitz on high speed for a minute, until the cucumber has broken down completely, then pass through a fine-mesh sieve, leaving a clear, green liquid discard the pulp.Heat the oil for the aromatics in a medium pan on a medium flame, then gently fry the chillies, garlic, ginger and coriander seeds for five minutes, stirring every now and then, until the garlic is just starting to brown. Add the coriander stalks, fry for a minute or two more, until the garlic is a light golden brown and the chilli aromatic, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the solids to a plate and sprinkle with a little flaked salt. Reserve the oil.Lift the gurnard from its cure, rinse well, then pat dry. With a very sharp knife, cut the fish against the grain into 5mm-thick slices (a bit like sashimi).Cut the reserved cucumber in half and scoop out the watery centre. Finely cut the flesh into matchsticks, then ide between four shallow bowls. Pour over the cucumber water and top with slices of the gurnard. Pour a teaspoon of aromatic oil over each and finish with a scattering of the aromatics.This is a simple supper for two, so double all the quantities if you want to feed more or want a more substantial portion.1 medium celeriac, peeled and cut into 3cm cubes (550g net weight)2½ tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper2 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped15g parsley, stalks and leaves finely chopped1 small fennel bulb, cut into 1mm-thick slices (use a mandoline, ideally) reserve any fronds, to serve3 lemons, 2 juiced, to get 60ml, the other cut into wedges, to serve2 sustainably sourced, skin-on sea bass fillets, pin-boned and skin lightly scored on an angle three times 25g pistachios, lightly toasted and roughly choppedHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. In a bowl, toss the celeriac with two tablespoons of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then spread out on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper. Roast for 30 minutes, until soft and golden, then transfer to a small saucepan. Roughly mash with a potato masher you want some texture, so don’t over-mash. Stir through the anchovies and parsley, and keep warm until ready to serve. In a medium bowl, mix the sliced fennel with two tablespoons of lemon juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.In a separate bowl, toss the fish fillets in the remaining two tablespoons of lemon juice and leave to marinate for five minutes.Line a small, 28cm x 18cm roasting dish with foil. Turn the grill to its highest setting and place the rack close to the heat source.Rub each fillet with three-quarters of a teaspoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt, then lay skin side up in the dish. Grill for about five minutes, until the flesh has turned white and the skin is crisp.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598629a2778570e49024fed98bb0e0d8c9763f96/0_14_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9413ef305432f518c7b1d55ea6fc18b","title":"credit card spending terms conditions rbs natwest","story":"Get your credit card finances in order or we’ll pull the plug on your plastic!That is the warning to millions of credit card holders from the Royal Bank of ScotlandNatWest group, who are being sent new terms and conditions giving the company the right to “freeze spending” or withdraw it altogether.It says the changes are designed to help customers avoid long-term credit card debt. But one  Money reader tells us that, in her opinion, the leaflets could “cause massive stress” to some.So why is the bank clamping down – and is it a good or bad thing?It says the move is in line with industry-wide new rules introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) designed to help people in “persistent debt”.That means RBS is unlikely to be alone in sending out such warnings.The new terms and conditions, state that if a customer pays more in interest and charges than other amounts owed (ie, purchases, balance transfers, advances etc) over two 18-month periods in a row, “we may freeze spending on your card account”. It says this will be done “to help you focus on starting to reduce your outstanding debt”.It adds that a customer will always be alerted before this happens, and an account would only be frozen or withdrawn “if you’re unable or unwilling to reduce the amount you owe”. These changes took effect from 21 May.RBSNatWest tells us: “We want to help customers pay off their debts” and the changes “will help us to be able to do that”.Meanwhile, one credit card industry expert told Money that the aim of this sort of measure was about “protecting the customer ... so people can’t rack up more debt if they are not managing to pay off the debt they already have”.Some card holders may take the view that they are managing their finances perfectly well and do not need protecting from themselves, particularly if that protection is going to take the form of the card company threatening to pull the plug on their plastic, potentially leaving them high and dry at the supermarket checkout or on holiday.RBS says the changes reflect the new FCA rules, introduced on 1 March this year but which do not fully take effect until 1 September. They will force credit card providers to take a series of steps to help customers who have got into a long-term habit of only making the minimum payment each month – something that can often mask underlying financial difficulties.The regulator says action is needed because more than 3 million UK credit card holders are in persistent debt, typically handing over about £2.50 in interest and charges for every £1 they repay.It comes amid this week’s clampdown on high-cost credit by the FCA, following an 18-month review into bank overdrafts, doorstep loans, catalogue credit and rent-to-own borrowing. It proposed a price cap in the rent-to-own sector, but stepped back from ordering price caps on overdrafts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c01348de81cd9862c0961baed554bfe0936889/0_162_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12db6c915e7bc562d5f705ae70b6a944","title":"get lucky competition addicts raking in thousands win prizes","story":"Serial ‘compers’ reveal how they have won holidays, laptops, festival tickets and moreOn the face of it, Di Coke has a lifestyle some can only dream of: a butler at her beck and call at Glastonbury festival, a private chef whipping up dinner for her at home, dining at Copenhagen’s Michelin-starred restaurant Noma and a guitar signed by Noel Gallagher, not forgetting the luxury holidays to destinations including New Zealand, Japan and Switzerland.But Coke’s glamorous lifestyle isn’t thanks to a well-paid job in the City, a lucrative inheritance, or pocketing a windfall from selling property. It’s down to luck. For Coke, who lives in Brighton with her husband and eight-year-old son, is an avid “comper”.Since graduating from university just over 20 years ago, Coke started entering competitions almost every day. “I started entering and ending up winning a guitar signed by Noel Gallagher and trips to Dublin, New York and Iceland,” says Coke, who once won a laptop and sold it for £2,500, helping fund a backpacking trip around the US. “That’s when I thought it was a hobby for me – it was time well spent.”Coke has turned entering competitions into a career, with the 43-year-old ditching her graphic designer job to run SuperLucky, a site dedicated to providing competition news and tips. Tracking her winnings on a spreadsheet, Coke\u0026nbspcalculates that she wins between £500 and £1,000 worth of prizes every month. “Some years I’ve won over £20,000 of prizes,” enthuses Coke, author of SuperLucky Secrets: 100 Tips for Winning Competitions, Contests and\u0026nbspSweepstakes.Like many other serial compers, Lola Bellouere-Keay uses her three-hour commute to enter competitions. “I have bookmarked a forum that has 20 pages of new competitions a day,” says the PR account executive, who started entering competitions two years ago when she couldn’t work due to a chronic knee problem.“I enter about 200 competitions a day. They’re all just forms and really easy to do. Just click on the link, and autofill puts in my details.” It has proved lucrative. So far this year\u0026nbspBellouere-Keay has won a trip to\u0026nbspthe Baftas, a phone, coffee machine, virtual reality headset, 240 bottles of water, £3,000 and Arcadia festival tickets.While she keeps many of the prizes, Bellouere-Keay sometimes gives them away as birthday presents or sells them online. “I sometimes win runners-up prizes, such a petrol lawnmower, which I don’t need. I sold it to a guy in Ireland for £240.”The extra money has come in useful. “I won £3,000 on the day I\u0026nbsppassed the theory part of the driving test, so I used that to buy a car and pay my insurance,” she says.It has also helped the 26-year-old boost her savings and splash out more on trips and dining out.But it’s the money-can’t-buy experiences that are more memorable for Bellouere-Keay. “I’ve gone on experiences I would never have gone on such as the Baftas, I’ve won a hot-air balloon experience I couldn’t normally afford and a stay in a treehouse in Wales that I wouldn’t usually spend £300 on.”From brand websites and radio shows to TV programmes and magazines, competitions can be found in a range of places. But it’s not always about just entering your email address. “The easiest ones to win are the hardest to enter,”says Coke. “If you’re asking people to take a video or visit a certain place, most people won’t bother.”Carlisle-based Lee Gardner, 40, knows this all too well. Last year he won a helicopter ride and VIP tickets to the Kendal Calling festival for himself and five friends after he entered a Strongbow competition in\u0026nbspwhich he had to buy a promotional pack and enter a code on the brand’s website.“I like the ones where you have to put effort in and dress up or purchase a code – ones that other people see and can’t be bothered to enter,” says Gardner, who, when I speak to him, is packing for a trip to New York that, of course, he won.“People think you never win but if you don’t enter, you won’t.”Gardner, who says he spends between one to two hours a day entering competitions, adds that they have helped pay for birthday presents such as a PlayStation 4 for his son and holidays.However, while prizes such as a year’s supply of washing powder or bedroom blinds might whip up a frenzy among some, Coke says she is “fussy now” and only enters competitions offering prizes she or her family might want. She says her favourite prize was when her son won a place as a mascot for Arsenal in the FA Cup final last year. “That was a massive occasion for me, my husband and my son. It was something money can’t buy.”Although some prizes can be lucrative, Sammy Fairman, editor of competitions website Simply Prizes, doesn’t believe we should all quit our jobs and start running around our local supermarket to find product packs with competitions on.“There are some compers who also run and write blogs, and so get income from advertising and free goods,” she explains. “But for your everyday comper this is a hobby that allows you to sometimes have things that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to afford otherwise.”However, be warned that entering competitions can lead you down a rabbit hole. “I know I can put it to one side,” says Coke. “But I think some people can get addicted. Some of my single mum friends who aren’t out on an evening can be up until 3am entering competitions. It’s endless – you’re never going to get to the point where it ends.”From Sammy Fairman, editor of the website Simply Prizes• Create a specific email address so your work emails aren’t inundated.• Understand that it’s a numbers game – the more you enter, the more chance you have of winning.• Only enter for prizes you want – entering for stuff that is of no use is a waste of time.• Encourage a few comping friends to join you on social media. They will be able to tag you into competitions you haven’t seen.• Enter local competitions. These are often specific to your area so can attract fewer entrants than those run\u0026nbspnationally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c3f852b4b17804b2bab4c3b70b586417e045f3/0_258_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71670905a54d1e29023fdbbe0f34265e","title":"how i spend it mairi frances mckay","story":"When I graduated from university last year I got an 18-month trainee post with Leicester council children’s services. It pays £16,000 a year which is a fraction of the average salary, but compared to my time as a student I feel flush.Until last summer I lived on a food budget of £20 a week and it was a struggle. I’d go to the supermarket late at night when stuff was marked down and eventually I realised that food went further if I made meals from scratch. I learned to order £40-worth of ingredients online and that would last a month. Now I spend £20 a week socialising with colleagues.I’m fortunate in that I still live with my parents. I pay them £300 a month in rent which is not a lot less than a house share would have been, but I get my food and utilities included and don’t have to worry about council tax.I’ve never had this much money in my life, but my budget is still tight. Clothes shopping is usually beyond my means I like good quality so go to H\u0026ampM rather than Primark if I need something. I have a lot of discount cards and vouchers. At university I had a smartphone, but now use a pay-as-you-go Nokia which costs very little. I walk to work which saves on bus fares and I bring my own lunch.We’re lucky in that we live in the inner city in a very vibrant erse area with lots of new restaurants so I can have a relatively cheap night out a couple of times a week.I like spending my money on experiences: our local theatre often does youth tickets for £5, although I’d happily pay £50 for a really good show, and I sometimes travel down to London to the West End. Quite a bit of my money goes on train tickets to visit friends and family. I also have a £300 season ticket for Leicester City and will often use staff discount to go and watch the Leicester Tigers rugby club at about £20 a time.We have always had one family holiday a year, usually in the UK but occasionally to places like the US as a rare treat. Until now my parents have paid for me but I expect that will change now I’m earning. About four times a year I’ll have a weekend away with friends. It’s always within the UK and we’ve become big fans of Airbnb because it’s such good value. I usually budget for £50 a trip, including food and accommodation.I’ve been training myself to swim a mile, but I use the local leisure centre rather than a private gym because it only costs about £5 .I come from a family that’s never had much money and so I’ve always been used to careful budgeting. I’d still live modestly even if I started earning big sums. I’ve never had dreams of the high life. We’re often giving to charity – I have a £15-a-month standing order – and to people on the street because that’s the sort of people we are.I left university with a £40,000 student loan to pay off, but I earn below the repayment threshold. When I’ve finished my training I will be on a salary of about £22,000 which seems like riches to me, but I still be on too little to start repaying.I know I’m lucky to be able to live with my parents and enjoy it, but I would urge to other students graduating with debts and small incomes to make the best of what you have. You can have a good life on very little if you’re careful.As told to Anna Tims"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728ff7715d1708a05e9bc33124110533c0e440ac/0_0_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c399b32620c61b24a2a691f095ca620f","title":"microsoft office cheap alternatives word excel","story":"I’m only a casual Word and Excel user and I don’t want a hefty monthly chargeEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.Ever since the Microsoft Office (Word and Excel) licence expired on my home computer, I get annoying pop-ups asking me to subscribe at £7.99 a month.

Not only was she nearly run over, having walked out in front of a car assuming it would stop, but now her favourite shop (“They sell the best bowls”) is closed. At one point, after some frantic buzzer-pressing (it’s that kind of place), the owner peers round the door only to tell us to come back in five days, while a FaceTime chat with a friend who might be able to help comes to nothing. It turns out that supermodel Giselle Bündchen paid a visit recently, and this brush with celebrity has made the owner a bit shy. “But I’m nobody,” Li says to the face in her phone. “I’m not famous.”She may not be Giselle famous, but over the course of four albums of emotionally swollen doom-pop, Li has single-mindedly carved out her own lane. While 2008’s debut Youth Novels, featuring whimsical single Little Bit, contained a semblance of untarnished naivety, 2011’s Wounded Rhymes (key song title: Sadness Is a Blessing) and 2014’s claustrophobically downbeat I Never Learn confirmed Li as modern pop’s bruised, goth-leaning moody sister. On the surface, that seems to have changed with this month’s new album, So Sad So Sexy, which sees her work with Malay (Frank Ocean), Skrillex and super-producer and partner Jeff Bhasker, with whom she has a two-year-old son. The result is an album that takes the sounds of hip-hop, R\u0026ampB and trap and scuffs them up via Li’s brand of overblown heartache.After years of rejecting the “pop star” tag – in part, a reaction to being lumped in with every female musician coming out of Sweden – she is now, reluctantly, softening to it. “Being indie is very much being against things,” she says as we try and find a place to chat. “But I’m more open-minded now.” Her first step to pop enlightenment was to strip away the reverb she’d always used on her vocals. Like everything when it comes to Li’s creativity – she’ll later compare music-making to Fitzcarraldo director Werner Herzog’s attempts to pull a 320-tonne steamboat over a mountain in documentary Burden of Dreams – it was a challenge, a state of being she seems to relish.“Jeff really pushed me hard,” she says. “He was like: ‘Take away that reverb, you need to fucking sing.’ It was crazy I was running out of the studio crying every day.” In fact, their relationship, which was being tested at work and at home, became a sort of studio soap opera. “It was a big show for everyone else they’re going to have tons of stories to tell. My new manager said we were the craziest – and he manages Courtney Love.”The “shit” she alludes to started during a break in touring I Never Learn. A sickly person, she ended up cancelling the Australian leg of the jaunt, even turning down a proposed support slot with Rihanna, whose Anti album has influenced So Sad So Sexy. “I’d been on a seven-year cycle of albums, tours, heartbreaks, trying to grow up,” she sighs. “All I wanted was to be in my fucking bed.”She recalls a meeting with Rihanna at a party. “She complimented me on my tits,” she laughs, before adding quickly “but this was before I had the baby. I had a very low-cut top on and she said, ‘Oh, look at you with your titties out.’ I feel like we had some kind of connection.”In a lot of ways, I Never Learn underlined the end of the first chapter of Li’s life she’d always seen those first albums as a trilogy, marking out her 20s, and taking her from the “cocky” Lykke Li of Youth Novels to the “just completely broken and exhausted and, like, fuck my life” shell of I Never Learn. Solace briefly came when she was “pregnant and chilling” in the shape of Liv, a 70s MOR-influenced supergroup of sorts featuring Bhasker, Björn Yttling and Miike Snow’s Andrew Wyatt and Pontus Winnberg, a project that was quickly curtailed by “orces and cats dying and ‘Oh, now I have to go and work with Miley Cyrus’.”She says early motherhood was “psychedelic”, and that it left her feeling “raw, needy, crazy”. Adjacent to the LA musical elite via Bhasker, whose production credits include Uptown Funk, Beyoncé’s 4 and most of Harry Styles’s solo album, she found herself fading into the background. “We’d show up somewhere,” she says, “and I was totally only a baby momma to them. Especially in this town. It becomes a big stigma, like: ‘Oh, you have a baby – OK, bye.’ I was nothing and nobody here, which in some way was really good – to have my ego completely broken, you know? To listen to Frank Ocean and be like: ‘Wow, I’m never going to make an album this good.’ Or, two months after giving birth, watching Lemonade and thinking: ‘I could never … I’m done.”’Did she find it frustrating that Bhasker, who won a Grammy for producer of the year in 2016, was able to continue working immediately? “Yeah, that was like: ‘Wow – the difference between being a man and a woman.’ I was a feminist before, but now it’s next level.” She also initially had problems finding a new manager and record deal (she’s now signed to Sony). “People were like: ‘She’s difficult,’ meaning: ‘She has an opinion, she demands a lot of attention to detail, but she makes no money.’”In July 2017, as the album was taking shape, her mother – who gave her a nomadic upbringing, moving the family from suburban Sweden to a village in Portugal and then back to Stockholm again, via holidays in India – died. Li says So Sad So Sexy carries the weight of the tragedy. “It was like: ‘Woah, wake up, you’re an adult.’”I remind Li of a previous interview, in which she said it was always her mother’s aim that Li be as “un-Swedish as possible”. Does Li think she succeeded? “Yeah, it’s sad, too, because when she got sick she actually did return to Sweden,” she says. “On her death bed she said: ‘Lykke, this is what’s important,’ because when she was there all her friends would come and visit her. I realised that that’s ultimately what you have. I love and miss Sweden so much now.”For the time being, though, she’s happy in LA, drawn, as ever, to its darker side, which even extends to living under President Trump. “It’s a historic moment, so it’s kind of pretty interesting, to be honest,” she says. “You’re in the heat of the fire. It’s completely fucked up, but I have a pretty dystopian view of the world anyway.”As our lunch comes to an end, Li has to rush off to finish editing two music videos. The deadline’s approaching and she’s itching to get them done.“I went to a hypnotist because I have some kind of control thing, and he was like: ‘You’re way worse than I thought – you’re an uber control freak.’” She laughs. “But I’m also a free spirit. I decide what I want to do, and that’s the way it’s going to be. Sometimes people are going to like it and sometimes they won’t.”So Sad So Sexy is out on 8 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8a5e158927f04afe0da00f4f7f0311cfd743dfc/57_376_2211_1327/master/2211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78a34ab3ff2070f057d11dfca6a381ad","title":"roadmap to avoid brexit to be sent to mps and peers","story":"George Soros-backed Best for Britain pushes for second referendum on Theresa May’s deal with EU MPs and peers will be sent a roadmap next week detailing how they could stop Brexit by the George Soros-backed Best for Britain group, which has amassed £2.3m in donations to spend on a nationwide lobbying effort to persuade parliament to change its mind.The group will publish a timetable as part of its “campaign manifesto” at a launch event on 8 June saying that MPs need to introduce amendments calling for a second referendum on the final deal secured by Theresa May in which remaining in the European Union is an option on the ballot paper.Best for Britain says it is theoretically possible for a referendum to be held within 17 working days of parliament legislating for one, meaning it could be held in December. But the pressure group says the EU would allow the UK to have a second referendum as late as February or March.Eloise Todd, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said a second referendum was necessary to ultimately settle the question of whether the UK should leave the EU: “We think people should have a chance to compare the deal we can get to the one we already have. What’s clear is we can’t have ‘a best of all worlds’ illusory Brexit as the debate about the Irish border shows.”To have any chance of success, Best for Britain would have to win over Labour’s front bench, plus more than 10 Tory rebels and shore up the support of sceptical backbench Labour MPs in constituencies that voted for leave in the 2016 referendum.The pressure group is stepping up its efforts to lobby 50 MPs by trying to generate pressure on them in their constituencies. It intends to take out advertisements in regional and local papers, starting on Saturday in the Scotsman, and buy up billboards in the target constituencies “as near to MPs’ offices as possible”. Campaign adverts, which have already appeared in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool as well as in some national newspapers, are headlined “When will we know what we voted for?” and add: “We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal”.Best for Britain said it would spend £500,000 of its £2.3m in donations on the newspaper and outdoor advertising campaign. The largest donor has been Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which has provided £800,000. He will not be attending next week’s launch event, but the 87-year-old financier and philanthropist gave a speech in Paris on Tuesday in which he trailed the launch, saying that Brexit was “an immensely damaging process”. He added: “Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better, however, if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.”Labour MPs in targeted leave-supporting areas include Caroline Flint, the Don Valley MP. She supported remain in 2016 but wrote last month that the UK should respect the referendum result and that parliament should stop “game playing” and reject proposals for a second national vote. Others in the campaign group’s focus include Ian Austin in Dudley North and the newly elected Gareth Snell in Stoke-on-Trent Central.Conservative MPs being targeted include John Stevenson, who holds the seat of Carlisle with a majority of 2,599 from Labour. Best for Britain says that future investment by multinational tyre maker Pirelli at a plant in the city remains at risk, unless the UK can at least remain part of a customs union with the EU.The pressure group believes the majority of the British public are turned off by the Brexit debate and will only seriously re-engage once the prime minister has concluded her orce negotiations with the EU. It is trying to train local organisers to organise street stalls or petitions with a target of having 20,000 conversations with members of the public in the 50 target seats.The involvement of Soros in the campaign has been attacked by rightwing newspapers, with the Daily Mail describing the Hungarian-American as a “foreign billionaire” engaged in a “plot to subvert Brexit”. Best for Britain uses that coverage as part of its fundraising campaigns, encouraging people to donate and “help us take on the Daily Mail” on a gofundme page that has raised £56,000 in the past week.Todd said: “The will of the people can be subverted by the will of the people in a second referendum. People can take a new decision based on new information.”The campaign group is not covered by Electoral Commission regulations, which ban foreign donors, because there is no pending national vote. However, a spokesman said the group did not take money from overseas and that Soros’s donations come via the Open Society Foundation’s UK branch, which is a company registered in England and Wales, which would mean they were permissible under election law.The campaign group hopes that several dozen MPs will attend the launch event, although does not intend to use any of its existing supporters as principal speakers. Labour MPs such as David Lammy and Jo Stevens have acted as spokespeople before, as well as Green party MP Caroline Lucas and Conservative Dominic Grieve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a4b54a246feaafc75cca2f9848c6251a805c33/0_271_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=379736263946a687e4ee2ab598cf6da0","title":"kevin mccloud town planners undervalued underfunded grand designs","story":"It was great to hear the Grand Designs presenter speak up for my vital, yet underfunded and unfairly maligned professionAs a chartered town planner since 2011, I know all too well what people think of my profession. And as a district councillor in Lichfield, I am also acutely aware of the challenges council planning teams face.So it was good to see Grand Design’s Kevin McCloud speaking up for underpaid, undervalued council planners. Helping to develop new towns and villages, improve retail centres and incubate economic growth are all roles for which planners are responsible. Yet we are often overlooked when the local economy improves, when new shops and leisure outlets move to an area – or when a much-needed school is provided. Council planners are the people who approve, or reject, developments. When their decision goes against what people want, they can become public enemy No 1. When a proposal to turn a two-bed semi into a miniature Windsor Castle is turned down, people don’t talk about poor architecture and lack of context. Instead, they blame the planning officer, who is protecting the character of an area.In 2016, nearly one in five public sector planners considered leaving the profession and it has been well publicised that the negative press and dwindling resources have had a real impact on morale. If you also factor in the higher pay available in the private sector, it becomes clear why councils struggle to retain the very best planners.  The housing crisis is heaping even more pressure on local authority planners. We all know the country needs new housing, but locating appropriate sites is a challenge. Addressing Birmingham’s housing shortfall, for instance, needs to be shared between the neighbouring authorities. I certainly do not envy the Lichfield planner who has to identify where to put our share. With local authorities struggling to balance their books against a backdrop of central government cuts, the position of planners can appear precarious. But I would argue that for councils, investing in the planning team can reap real benefits. A good planner has a real opportunity to develop an area, promote economic growth and help provide high-quality housing. Within my own district planners are helping to drive employment growth, provide much-needed housing, and promote regeneration projects set to revitalise the city centre.  My profession is underloved and overworked – but this can be overcome, if we are able to take on new planners. This is something many councils understand – job adverts are out at most authorities in the Midlands. The authorities have exciting opportunities with town centre regeneration projects, new retail developments – and, of course, the forthcoming 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. All of these require significant input from local authority planners. Being a town planner often requires a thick skin. But planners play a vital role in evolving our towns, cities, and rural areas – and public sector planners should receive decent pay and recognition for the work they do to promote economic growth while protecting conservation areas, the green belt and much more.

Dunlop lays down the law in regard to this rare interview and all other personal interaction because from Saturday, and during six days of deadly racing, he will reach speeds in excess of 200mph as he pushes his motorbike to the limit on ordinary roads and mountain passes that have taken the lives of 256 riders over the years.Dunlop is one of the most intriguing yet prickliest men in sport. He has won 15 TT races and will surely go on to break the record held by his uncle Joey, the greatest road racer in history, who won 26 times on the Isle of Man before being killed on his bike in 2000. Dunlop also lost his father, Robert, Joey’s brother, at the North West 200 in their native Northern Ireland in 2008. Since we did this interview, Dan Kneen, who rode alongside Dunlop for Tyco BMW, died on Wednesday evening in practice for the TT.Stressing that he is “as fired up as I’ve ever been”, the 29-year-old does not dismiss a question as to whether he may shatter another TT record by winning six races at this year’s meeting. “Anything is possible,” he says. “But I’ll have to ride my bike as hard as I can. If that’s good enough to win, then great. If it’s not, that’s the way life is. These are long races and a lot goes on. We’ll take each one as it comes and see where we end up.”I have learned that with Dunlop it is wise to approach each encounter with few expectations that his brusque manner will soften and open a few chinks in the wall he has built around himself. We met for the first time last month, in the Triangle, as the North West 200 course is known, linking Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush.Ten years and one day had passed since his dad died on those very roads and Dunlop said a wary hello. It had been made clear he was not giving any interviews and I did not press him. Instead we spoke briefly about his 2017 book, Road Racer, which provides a compelling account of his dad’s death.On 15 May 2008 Robert and his two sons, William and Michael, were practising at the North West when the red flags came out. Eventually Michael saw “a man lying next to what’s left of his bike. That’s when it hits me. The man lying next to the broken bike is my dad”.Two days later, and defying the race stewards who declared that neither he nor his brother were fit to race, Michael got back on his bike. He wanted to honour his father by racing. The stewards were made to back down by a 19-year-old.Now, on the Isle of Man, Dunlop remembers how he only felt peace when snapping down his visor. Above the roaring engines, a sound that defined his father’s life, Dunlop heard silence. He looks at me for the first time since our interview began 15 minutes earlier: “Once you’re on the bike you’ve got freedom. It’s only you. Off the bike lots of people are picking and poking at you. I’m free on the bike.”In 2008 the teenage Dunlop raced wheel-to-wheel against Christian Elkin and the great John McGuinness. It was a dramatic race with, as Dunlop suggests in his book, “no love given, no love lost … I’m going so fast I don’t know if I can stop”.Dunlop won and the crowd erupted – in memory of Robert and in amazement at the grit of his son. For Dunlop: “My head’s full of tears. I’ve won the race but I can’t find any happiness in it. Tomorrow, I bury my father.”He has done so much since then. When Dunlop won the Senior TT last year he moved up to fourth among the all-time winners while strengthening his reputation as the world’s best road racer and the sport’s most difficult man. He loathes interviews and the only person able to persuade him to talk to me is Paul Phillips, who runs the TT, the race meeting that means most to Dunlop.“People say you need newspapers to create sponsorship. But the newspapers only want to speak to you when you’re winning. I don’t do much press now because I don’t like the bullshit.”Dunlop’s stark honesty is bracing. I hope I am not “pushing and poking” him too hard? He shrugs. “Everybody does – in one way or the other.”He only really begins to engage when I mention the 2015 TT. Two days before he was due to race his Yamaha he swapped it for a BMW. It is as bizarre as Lewis Hamilton stepping away from his Mercedes before a race and climbing inside a Ferrari. Surely this caused huge flak? “I don’t believe in flak. I don’t do flak. I do my own thing and if people don’t like it that’s their problem. I’m not a monkey at a circus. I’m not here to entertain anyone. I’m just here to win.”It still seems incredible he could hop on to a rival bike despite contracts and lawyers. “There’s a real story there,” he concedes. “But we’ll save that for another book. It’s not about who wears the right T-shirt or who shocked who. It’s about winning.”He is on a variety of bikes at this year’s TT, refusing to be tied to one manufacturer while running his own team, Michael Dunlop Racing. Apart from showing his voracious ambition it underlines Dunlop’s intelligence, despite his limited education, in securing the best bikes. “It’s not about the best bikes,” he insists. “All the manufacturers’ bikes are pretty equal. It’s about finding the best people I can do business with.”Dunlop acknowledges the gravity of road racing in his book: “Death is responsible for the man I am today – my dad going, my winning that race the day before his funeral, continuing the Dunlop ‘dynasty’ … I’d give it all up tomorrow to have him back just for a day.”He winces. “It was a stupid thing to say because anybody who lost their father would feel that. It’s the same for any normal human being.”His uncle Joey is feted justifiably but Dunlop believes his father was often as good on the bike and sometimes even better. “Oh yeah. He obviously had a shorter career but he was real good. He had two life-changing injuries so he had to keep motivating himself to get better. He was such a strong person and one of the toughest men who ever rode.”Robert Dunlop crashed so badly during practice for the TT in May 1994 that he spent six months in hospital and was bed-ridden for a year. His son, however, says: “I don’t take fear into consideration. Fear stays with you for ever. So I don’t do fear. Yeah, I’ve been scared on a bike but you don’t dwell on it. The important thing is to keep pushing.”When last did he feel scared on his bike? “Not so long ago … but long enough not to remember it.”His closest rival, Ian Hutchinson, one ahead of Dunlop on the all-time list and winner of a record five TT victories in a week, suffered another horrendous crash in the Senior race last year. Hutchinson could not walk for 11 months but he returned to racing two weeks ago at the North West. He shuffled over on a stick and gave me a gripping interview.Does Dunlop admire Hutchinson’s courage in making it to the TT? “Everyone who races motorbikes does their own thing. I don’t look out for anyone else. They don’t look out for me.”Does he really dislike Hutchinson? “That’s not the point. I just race motorbikes.”Dunlop is more relaxed when he tells me about the veterinary practice he part-owns in Dublin. “The lady that runs it is fantastic. I try to go as often as I can but I let her get on with it. She doesn’t need me asking stupid questions. For me it wasn’t just a business decision. It was also wanting to do something different.”“It’s not because I’m a wanker. I live alone so I’m fortunate I’m my own free man. My mum’s always very good. She never asks any questions. She’s had her troubles, like everyone, but she keeps going and pushing – like I do.”I can sense how hard Dunlop will push himself and his bike at the TT and so I thank him for giving me half an hour. He stretches out his hand and says: “No problem.”Outside, lines of people try to glimpse Dunlop inside his motorhome. He may turn out to be the mightiest Dunlop of them all but he looks lost to the world. Dunlop is hunched over a bike, talking to a mechanic, absorbed in his work. He almost looks happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce60288cd36a3fe7895dbe2a6f2a09822bd0c5c/0_14_3556_2134/master/3556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5598e42b89d6fbea7205dc5c33520a","title":"us national spelling bee facial expressions in pictures","story":"Competitors in the Scripps National Spelling Bee often struggle to contain their emotions when asked to spell obscure or complicated words.

They were aggresively unimpressed. Steve Waugh left them cold, they couldn’t care less about Flintoff and even Robin Smith and found Warne merely comic. But right at the end, I nabbed them with a bit of Viv. ‘Ouais d’accord, ça, c’est cool.’ they said. It was only a 20 second clip of Sir IVA walking out to bat. Now, that is charisma.”Woot woot department The umpires will inspect at 1.50pmThanks to Ali for pointing out this interesting story about a possible four-day Test between England and Ireland. A four-day match would give the underdogs a greater chance of a draw, and you can probably finish this joke yourself.I can confirm that the rain has all but stopped here. Am on Kirkstall Lane and there is just the lightest whisper of moisture in the air. Fingers crossed...Rain update “The MO’s Rain Radar shows that the rain is moving NW and will clear from the SE quite soon,” says Christopher Squire. “The main area of rain is to the east and heading for North Yorkshire, not Headingley. There is small but heavy area of rain of over Doncaster which will pass close by.” Lunch There’s no official word that the umpires have called an early lunch, but my stomach has just groaned a five-letter word. See you in 30 minutes or so for more synonyms of rain.“You poor love,” says Robert Wilson.”It’s a hard ask, OBOing a rain day. The desperate gesture of dangling a Viv Richards reference was particularly heartbreaking (you know it’s gonne bring all us old ****s out of the woodwork). I was tempted to tell you the story of how Viv actually came up in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom yesterday, but I’m just not that cheap a date.”I, however, am that desperate a date. Let’s hear it.“Afternoon Rob,” says Philip Tsirtsonis. “Doing my shopping in Headingley this morning. It’s rammed with rather damp and depressed looking cricket fans. I really, really do feel sorry for them. Then again, this weekend’s weather means there should be plenty of cricket left to play on Monday and Tuesday when, including my student discount, I get to attend for £5. Feeling very ambivalent!” “That was quite the acceptance speech,” says Mac Millings. “I wrote a screenplay many years ago (never submitted), but I didn’t start it until I had finished my Academy Award acceptance speech. It was a lot better than the screenplay.”You can’t know what direction you want to take your story until you know how you’d make a fool of yourself at the Oscars.This match is officially called the Participation Test, part of a worthy initiative from Sky and the ECB to increase ersity in grassroots participation. At the moment, alas, it’s the Precipitation Test: it’s still raining at Headingley, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if there is no play today.“Good afternoon Rob,” says Matt Turland. “Still raining in Horsforth (couple of miles west of Headingley) but there is some good news. If it keeps up like this, as I’ve got tickets for tomorrow, I’m very confident that I’ll be able to watch Mo Amir bowl! So that should put a smile on everyone’s face.”“I see Mr. Busfield has adopted the narrative of blaming the building work and drainage for the abandonment of the Essex game in April,” says Tim Sanders. “I think it’s more to do with the amount of snow and rain in the spring, and the almost total absence of sunny, breezy days to dry the pitch out before the game. We’ll see who’s right just as soon as this drizzle stops...”I’ll plead ignorance on this one. I’ll also plead excessive grumpiness over widespread use of ‘narrative’.While the heavens gently weep, may I encourage you to read this lovely tribute to AB de Villiers by the wonderful Dale Steyn.“Hi Rob,” says James Calder. “If it’s effortless West Indian shot-making porn you’re after, how about this most dismissive of dismissive square cuts from King Viv? Some top-notch knitting in there too!” Hahaha, that shot is ridiculous. Get that filth out of my sight. “Morning Rob,” says Chris Drew. “Is this a good time to point out that you’re currently second in the County Cricket fantasy league?” Thank you! I am not able to express all my gratitude, because now, my body is in tumult because it is a colossal moment of joy so everything is really in a way that I cannot express. I would like to be Jupiter! And kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making love to everybody, because I don’t know how to express. It’s a question of love. You are really - this is a mountain of snow, so delicate, the suavity and the kindness, it is something I cannot forget, from the bottom of my heart. And thank you for the Fantasy League, for fhose who really loved the selection of Darren Stevens. Thank you very much. And I hope, really I don’t deserve this, but I hope to come second in some other Fantasy League! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you! “On the subject of amazing pieces of timing, this is my favourite,” says Phil Harrison. “I love everything about this clip from the sound of the ball off the bat to the rumble of astonishment in the crowd to the note of awe in Michael Atherton’s voice.” Punter is also responsible for my favourite bat-on-ball sound.“I don’t speak Weather very well, but I can say that a few miles away in West Yorkshire the rain has stopped,” says John Starbuck. “It’s still very overcast with slightly lower cloud than usual, therefore not exactly a fog, but trying. The main thing is there’s not much wind, so little prospect of it blowing over for a while.”Mark Wood and his imaginary wickets“Ol’ Woody is a decent bloke and all that but how long is it since he climbed on to his imaginary horse and delivered a spell at 90mph+?” says Gary Naylor. “And if he isn’t at that speed, is he taking the place of one who is - Warwickshire’s Olly Stone? If Mark Wood blasts out a county side or two like a Mini-Mikey Oval 1976, then he’s proved himself worth a recall, but I feel he’s getting picked on reputation at the moment.”That’s probably fair, though I think he bowled pretty well in the last two Tests. I’d be worried about picking Stone too early as he could easily have a Patterson Thompson. I also don’t think you can risk Stone and Bess in the same attack. But he is very exciting - and very quick.It’s still raining I’m off to procure a hit of caffeine. See you in a few minutes.Another email! “It’s become a bit of a thing lately for England supporters to have a dig at Joe Root for various reasons,” says Phil Harrison. “But I’ve just noticed he’s 56 short of reaching 6000 Test runs - and if he gets there in this match, he’ll have got their quicker (in terms of games at least), than, among others, Tendulkar, Richards, Hammond, Sangakkara, Dravid and Ponting. Even given the generally poisonous atmosphere surrounding English cricket at the moment, we should enjoy him while we have him. PS, if you’re still in the mood for melancholy, moving techno...” His level of consistency is pretty staggering, isn’t it? I do think concerns about his captaincy are fair enough, but I agree that we expect too much of him as a batsman. He’s the only Englishman in the last 50 years to average over 50 in Test cricket. What did you do with your life?(And thanks for the link, I’ll save that for a wee post-work treat.)Apropos very little, I wrote something about Carl Hooper for the Nightwatchman recently and came across this clip. If there has been a better piece of timing in the history of sport, never mind cricket, I haven’t seen it.Thanks to Payter Aitch for today’s TMS YouTube link.“Morning Rob,” says Adrian. “Your advice for Ed Smith to speak to Alex Ferguson and Pep Guardiola got me wondering what a Guardiola coached cricket team might look like. I imagine the running between the wickets would improve, although a few slip fielders might get moved out of the cordon because they aren’t good enough with their feet.”The strange thing is that I had no idea Fabian Delph could play as a wicketkeeper-batsman. “I’m not sure when play will start - my guess is some time in the afternoon. But then the radar shows a big blob of rain that is twisting round rather than moving in a set direction, so it could scupper the whole day. Stare into this for a sustained spell and you can easily convince yourself either way.”Anyone out there who speaks Weather? If so, let us know what you think about the prospects of play today.An email! “Had a sleepless night wondering about Keaton Jennings’ innings,” writes Pete Salmon (and nones of others). “Obviously compared to recent opening bats it’s Dylan goes electric, but it’s still only 29 runs, and a stand of 53. Has the problem been solved? I need a yesno in order to get some sleep.”Yes. You have my word.It’s still raining, so play will not begin at 11am. What ya gonna do?“A bit miserable here in Leeds,” writes our own Ali Martin. “ Not heavy rain but not shifting either. Gah. Anyway, just thought I’d pen a few words on Chris Woakes, who quietly slipped back into the team off the back of minimal first-class cricket and picked up three wickets (which couldshould have been four with a more convincing appeal when Usman Salahuddin gloved behind). He was clearly a bit rusty at first - and didn’t bowl as well when switched downhill from the Kirkstall Lane End in the afternoon - but he supported Broad excellently in the morning and removed the two Pakistan batsmen, Haris Sohail and Asad Shafiq, who looked most comfortable out there. “As much as I retain a faith in Mark Wood transferring his talents into Test wickets, I still found it odd Woakes missed out at Lord’s (the ground where he took 11 against a stronger Pakistan line up two years ago). It almost felt that, for all the talk from Ed Smith about picking a squad for the here and now, Wood got the nod for the final XI in response to the winter. Granted the wickets didn’t come for Woakes during the Ashes, but he was also asked to perform a holding role to defensive fields using the old Kookaburra. To my mind he is the third best seamer in the country with a Duke ball in hand and as Nasser Hussain has said, this England team aren’t good enough to be omitting their best at home right now.”Yes, I completely agree. It’s so tricky to balance today, tomorrow and next year, especially when you are struggling today. I would pick Woakes or Wood based on form and conditions, and worry about the winter at the end of the season. The danger is that we forget the lessons of the Australia tour and end up having the same conversation in January 2022. If I was Ed Smith I would ask Sir Alex Ferguson and Pep Guardiola if they have a couple of hours to talk about balancing the present and the future. It’s such a difficult thing to do well.Also: when I grow up I’d like to be Chris Woakes. He’s such an impressive human being.Mickey Arthur is talking to Isa Guha“It was a disappointing day. We didn’t show the same discipline as at Lord’s. I thought it was a good toss to win but we were too loose in the first session and a half. To be fair I thought England were outstanding. Their plans were good and they bowled exceptionally well.“Lord’s was an unbelievable performance. We can’t expect that to happen all the time, but what matters is that we keep learning. This team has unbelievable potential.”“There’s a bit in Fever Pitch where Nick Hornby talks about the first time he watches a match where all the players are younger than him,” says Ian Forth. “What about the first time you watch a Test match and one of the English team is younger than one of your sons? What then?”Then, Ian, you are eligible for our modern midlife crisis offer! You can get a a year’s supply of moisturiser, a new appreciation of mindfulness and a feminist tattoo for just £500!Read all about yesterday’s playWe’ll be testing you later.There’s no official word about a delayed start, but I’d be surprised if play begins at 11am.Sam Curran is chatting to Sky’s Ian Ward. And what a likeable kid he is.“It feels pretty mad, like I’m still dreaming. It only sunk in after about 10 overs, when I was at fine leg and thought, ‘This is pretty cool.’ I grew up watching Broady and Jimmy take wickets and now I’m on the same field as them. To be honest it didn’t feel like just another game – I was pretty nervous at the top of my mark before my first over. The first two balls were really full and I thought, ‘This could be a long day’, but once I got into my spell I felt better and better.“I think I was pretty inconsistent in my bowling but I only bowled seven overs so I won’t look into it. In the second innings I’ll be a bit harsher on myself and try to hit my length consistently. A big first-innings lead would be massive for us. I spoke to Bessy this morning and he’s looking for his hundred!”The covers are on at Headingley, with a bit of mizzle in the air. The weatherman never lies, unless he wants a quiet game of golf.Morning. This England side haven’t been great at coming from behind, whether in a match or a series, so we shouldn’t underestimate what they achieved yesterday. After one day they are in control of this match, and all things being equal they’ll draw the series at some stage on Monday.It was a smart, determined and often skilful performance, led by the rejuvenated Stuart Broad. England will resume this morning on 106 for two, a deficit of 68, with Joe Root looking very good on 29 and Dom Bess on 0. The forecast is mixed today but England literally have all the time in the world to cement their winning position.Pakistan know all about unlikely comeback wins - I’m still not over Multan - and will feel they are still in this. All things are rarely equal when Pakistan play Test cricket. They bowled excellently last night and if they can restrict England to a lead of around 100, we may be in for one of Ashley Giles’ beloved arse-nippers.(It’s safe to click that link it just goes to an old Ashley Giles article, not some peculiar ferret-based porn. Or does it?)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dcddfda83e12b8b291c39ab383663db1785ae5c/0_199_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d9b863b64cc2a891f900afac091910","title":"facebook teens leaving instagram snapchat study user numbers","story":"Numbers using Facebook have dropped significantly since 2015, with YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat more popularTeenagers have abandoned Facebook in favour of other social media platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram, according to a study from the Pew Research Center.“This is something we have observed anecdotally for a long time,” said the eMarketer analyst Paul Verna, who said his own daughters – aged 17 and 14 – are the perfect representative case study.“When the 17-year-old turned 13, getting a Facebook account was a rite of passage. Not long after she got the account she realised she didn’t have much use for it. When the younger one turned 13 she didn’t even lobby for a Facebook account. It was all about Instagram for her and still is,” he said.“It’s a big plus that Facebook owns Instagram, but this is a problem for their flagship brand and platform that they really need to sink their teeth into.”Teens are highly prized by social platforms for a number of reasons: people tend to take their habits with them as they age, they give platforms the “cool factor” and attract advertisers.

Slow to take off, it accelerated fast after 2009 when passport-holders from the Caribbean island nation were granted visa-free travel to the 26-nation Schengen zone. Wealthier countries such as Canada, the UK and New Zealand have also seen the potential of CIPs (the US EB-5 programme is worth about $4bn a year to the economy) but sell their schemes more around the attractions of a stable economy and safe investment environment than on freedom of movement.Experts from the many companies, such as Henley and Partners, CS Global and Apex, now specialising in CIPs and advertising their services online and in inflight magazines, say that unlike Abramovich, relatively few of their clients buy citizenship in order to move immediately to the country concerned.For most, the acquisition represents an insurance policy: with nationalism, protectionism, isolationism and fears of financial instability on the rise around the world, the state of the industry serves as an effective barometer of global political and economic uncertainty.But CIPs are not without their critics. Malta, for example, has come under sustained fire from Brussels and other EU capitals for its programme, run by Henley and Partners, which according to the IMF saw more than 800 wealthy iniduals gain citizenship in the three years following its launch in 2014. Critics said the scheme was undermining the concept of EU citizenship, posing potential major security risks, and providing a possible route for wealthy iniduals – for example from Russia – with opaque income streams to dodge sanctions in their own countries. Several other CIPs have come under investigation for fraud, while equality campaigners increasingly argue the moral case that it is simply wrong to grant automatic citizenship to ultra-high net worth iniduals when the less privileged must wait their turn – and, in many cases, be rejected. The best-known – and cheapest – CIP schemes are in the Caribbean, where the warm climate, low investment requirements and undemanding residency obligations have long proved popular. Five countries currently offer CIPs, often giving visa-free travel to the EU, and have recently cut their prices to attract investors as they seek funds to help them rebuild after last year’s hurricanes. In St Kitts and Nevis a passport can now be had for a $150,000 donation to the hurricane relief fund, while Antigua, Barbuda and Granada have cut their fees to $100,000, the same level as St Lucia and Dominica. Almost half of the EU’s member states offer some kind of investment residency or citizenship programme leading to a highly prized EU passport, which typically allows visa-free travel to between 150 and 170 countries. Malta’s citizenship-for-sale scheme requires a €675,000 donation to the national development fund and a €350,000 property purchase. In Cyprus the cost is a €2m investment in real estate, stocks, government bonds or Cypriot businesses (although the number of new passports is to be capped at 700 a year following criticism). In Bulgaria, €500,000 gets you residency, and about €1m over two years plus a year’s residency gets you fast-track citizenship. Investors can get residency rights leading longer term to citizenship – usually after five years, and subject to passing relevant language and other tests – for €65,000 in Latvia (equities), €250,000 in Greece (property), €350,000 or €500,000 (property or a small business investment fund) or €500,000 in Spain (property, and you have to wait 10 years to apply for citizenship). Thailand offers several “elite residency” packages costing $3,000-$4,000 a year for up to 20 years residency, some including health checkups, spa treatments and VIP handling from government agencies. The EB-5 US visa, particularly popular with Chinese investors, costs between €500,000 and $1m depending on the type of investment and gives green card residency that can eventually lead to a passport. Canada closed its CA$800,000 (£460,000) federal investment immigration programme in 2014 but now has a similar residency scheme, costing just over CA$1m, for “innovative start-ups”, as well as regional schemes in, for example, Quebec. Australia requires an investment of AU$1.5m (£850,000) and a net worth of AU$2.5m for residency that could, eventually, lead to citizenship, and New Zealand – popular with Silicon Valley types – an investment of up to NZ$10m (£5.2m)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58b87f170970526fb6c238f1efe7ee971246c95/143_0_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63fb604512f473664eac481226fc3da7","title":"egypt abdel fatah al sisi sworn in second term amid crackdown on dissent","story":"MPs gather for pompous ceremony that follows arrests targeting opponents and criticsThe Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al Sisi, has been sworn in for a second term, following a fresh round of arrests targeting opponents and critics. “Egypt can fit us all with all our differences. Accepting others and creating common ground will be important for us in order to create political development,” he told MPs who gathered to witness his oath of office, following a ceremony heavy on military pomp. Some interrupted his speech to shout their admiration of the president, including one MP who recited a poem of praise.Sisi’s inauguration follows a renewed crackdown on even the most benign opposition to his rule. In recent weeks, at least six prominent dissidents have been arrested and detained in pre-dawn raids. Twenty-two people protesting a fare hike on the Cairo metro were arrested and investigated on terrorism charges, including joining a banned group. As Sisi took oath of office, the arrests of recent weeks indicated that his second term may allow even less space for dissent than his first. Since coming to power in 2013, Sisi’s rule has been marked by efforts to crush all forms of dissent, with his government targeting Islamists, critics, activists, human rights organisations and journalists. But with almost no public opposition remaining, he is working to shore up support within an already compliant system. More than 200 MPs in Egypt’s rubber-stamp parliament have switched allegiances to a new political party, Future of the Homeland, founded to support Sisi and drawing comparisons with the corrupt National Democratic Party of deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Its creation is a possible precursor to an anticipated referendum which would alter the constitution to extend presidential terms, removing limits and allowing Sisi to become “president for life”.The opulent inauguration followed a wave of arrests of dissidents including the blogger Wael Abbas, labour lawyer and socialist activist Haytham Mohamadeen, satirist Shady Abu Zeid, activist Shady al-Ghazaly Harb and outspoken former Sisi supporter Hazem Abd al-Azim. It also includes activist Amal Fathy, who made a video discussing sexual harassment in Egypt. “Sisi is expecting a turbulent second mandate so he needs the opposition forces to be under control while unchecked voices are silenced,” said Fathy’s husband, Mohamed Lotfy, the head of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms. The French journalist Nina Hubinet earlier this week said she had been barred from entering Egypt after arriving in Cairo for a holiday five years after she last reported from there. In February, Egypt arrested and deported British journalist Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times. “The inequality of growth is stark and the situation of most Egyptians is still quite dire,” said Michael Hanna, an analyst with the New York thinktank The Century Foundation.Adham Youssef contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6932b84affd0892ebe20ee76ecf912a87d139de2/0_28_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686dec9970638034d0f666249773c983","title":"guatemala texas rio bravo border claudia gomez","story":"A week ago, 20-year-old Claudia Gómez was shot dead by border patrol agents in Texas – and no one has provided answers for her grieving familyby  Nina Lakhani in San Juan Ostuncalco and  Tom Dart in Rio BravoWhen Claudia Gómez was a little girl she would climb fruit trees for cherries and apricots, and chase her friends through the lush corn fields scattered across the hills of their village in western Guatemala.Her family remember her as a warm-hearted and mischievous girl who was riveted by mathematics from an early age, and who would sing to her two younger sisters as she braided their long black hair.“My daughter was naughty and cuddly and playful. She loved to draw and sing,” said Lidia González, 39, who was wrapped in a traditional woven shawl and headscarf against the chilly night at the family home.As she spoke, González gazed sadly at a makeshift shrine: a wide open basket containing a photograph of Claudia, surrounded by candles and bunches of long-stemmed white chrysanthemums.“Claudia was a good girl and a good student. My daughter didn’t do anything wrong, it’s not fair that immigration killed her – why did they do that?” she said.It is over a week since 20-year-old Claudia Patricia Gómez González was shot in the head by a US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agent in Rio Bravo, Texas, and no one has provided answers for her grief-stricken mother. “It doesn’t make sense,” Gonzalez said, speaking in the indigenous Mayan Mam language through an interpreter. “We spoke the day before she died – and she was excited and happy.” San Juan Ostuncalco is sprawling collection of mostly Mam communities scattered amid the forest-clad mountains outside Guatemala’s second largest city Quetzaltenango.This region was the setting for repeated atrocities by government forces during the country’s 36-year civil war that left 200,000 civilians dead – most of them indigenous – and triggered a wave of forced migration to the US in the 1980s. The tell-tale signs of migration are everywhere. Rural town centres are packed with fast food joints and malls, and the winding potholed roads are peppered with American-style concrete houses – including the Gómez family home. Like many children in this region, Gómez saw little of her father growing up because he spent years in the US as an undocumented migrant until he was deported last year.She was raised by a tight network of female relatives by 12, she had mastered the skill of making tortillas by hand after copying her mother, aunts and grandmothers who all live close by.In high school, Gómez played midfield in football and gave reggaeton dance lessons in between classes, homework, dating and heart-to-hearts with her friends. She was a devout Christian who recently swapped the family’s Catholic tradition for an evangelical church.Life was hectic and full of possibilities. She graduated in 2016 with an accounting certificate, but the ambitious youngster was rejected by a string of banks and local businesses.She applied to San Carlos University to study for an accounting degree but didn’t pass the tough entrance exam for a place at the country’s only public university her family could not afford to send her to one of Guatemala’s many private universities. After more than a year stuck at home with no job and no money, the future looked bleak. One by one, her school friends were giving up on work, to get married and have babies, but Gómez wanted more. “I’m going to America,” she told her parents firmly. “Don’t worry, I’ll be back in a few years.”She left home in early May, excited about the impending adventure in the US, where she hoped to find work to pay for university – and be reunited with her boyfriend, who had made it to Virginia about a year earlier. It was 3am when she hugged her grandmother Tomasa Vicente, 70, and told her: “Don’t worry abuela, I’ll be back soon – I promise.”It is unclear what she knew about the increasing hostility towards migrants under Trump when she convinced an aunt in Atlanta to loan her money to pay the coyote, or guide, about $10,000.“My niece left home like I did 18 years ago, because it’s the only way to escape poverty and move forward,” said the aunt, who asked for her name to be withheld for fear of deportation and separation from her US-born children.“She wanted to live her dreams, make something of her life. I was waiting for her to call, but the call I got was to tell me she was dead. This is a nightmare. I am so sad.”Gómez made the perilous journey through Mexico with five other youngsters from neighbouring rural communities. It was her first journey out of Quetzaltenango.She was killed in Texas less than three weeks after leaving home.Rio Bravo is a tiny, sparsely populated settlement well away from the legal ports of entry and border fences in Laredo. It is a popular crossing point for undocumented migrants who make their way by raft or boat across the river that represents the iding line between the US and Mexico.The southern US border – with its inhospitable terrain and guards – is a treacherous place for migrants. A  investigation published three weeks before Gómez was killed found that CPB agents used deadly force on at least 97 people in the past 15 years. Almost 73,000 Guatemalan families have been detained at that border in the past three years.Gómez died in circumstances that remain unclear, in an overgrown lot framed by ramshackle homes. She was about a third of a mile from the border.Border patrol initially said that an agent fired the fatal shot after a group of people he suspected of being undocumented resisted arrest and attacked him “using blunt objects”.The shooting was witnessed and filmed by a neighbour who posted a video online.Two days later, the CPB cancelled a press conference, and released a new statement in which some details were changed and there was no reference to “blunt objects”. It read: “According to the agent, the group ignored his verbal commands and instead rushed him.”González was no longer described as an “assailant”, but a “member of the group,” it said.Shortly after Gómez died, three of her travel companions were detained. They await deportation. The whereabouts of the other two is unknown.The unnamed agent is on administrative leave while the FBI investigates.When the  visited Rio Bravo a week after Gómez’s death, four border patrol SUVs were stationed at the river’s edge while a police patrol car drove through the town.It remains unclear why the CPB changed its story, but the agency did not respond to the ’s questions.Activists in the US have called for transparency in the case.“I think people are sceptical that justice will happen,” said Sister Rosemary Welsh, who runs a migrant shelter in Laredo and a mobile health clinic that visits Rio Bravo. “My concern is that if there isn’t a really good investigation – and I have to believe that there will be – then it’ll cause more unrest.”“Why was lethal force needed?” she asked.José Saldana, 22, of the Laredo Immigrant Alliance, a recently-formed advocacy group, said: “They want to militarise the border but they don’t have the proper training.”The unanswered questions have only added to the family’s grief back in Guatemala.“What’s the agent’s name? Has he killed before?” said paternal aunt Dominga Vicente, 42, speaking at the family home as her youngest child slept wrapped in a sling on her back. “We ask God to bless the kind woman who filmed the scene, otherwise my niece would be just another disappeared migrant. Tell the Americans we want justice.”At the family home, a towering cloud of smoke emanated from the open cooking fire as dozens of women prepared corn tamales, black beans and huge pots of chicken stew.Thanks to donations from friends, neighbours and relatives – the simple feast will feed hundreds of mourners accompanying the parents as they bring home Gomez’s body to its final resting place.Claudia Gómez will be buried on Saturday returned to mother earth where Mayans believe life begins. Vigils have also been held in Rio Bravo and in Alexandria, Virginia, where Gómez hoped to be reunited with her boyfriend.Her grandmother Tomasa Vicente recalls her last goodbye, grasping on to her listener’s arm with a wrinkled hand.“She was so happy and excited to go, but my heart was heavy. ‘Please be careful, I told her, stay in touch, and pray to God to keep you safe,’” she said. “She promised to come home but now she’s gone forever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ed9ee217d1f77fdc4caf18b4979ac92c1d7f6d/0_283_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be233b71247f962a86da6df48f164576","title":"mattis accuses china of intimidation and coercion in south china sea","story":"US defence secretary warns of consequences if China continues militarisation of manmade islandsChina’s placement of weapons systems on manmade islands in the South China Sea is designed to intimidate and coerce others in the region, the US defence secretary James Mattis has said, laying out a sharp criticism of Beijing at an international security forum.Speaking at the Singapore summit, he warned that America’s recent move to disinvite China from a multinational naval exercise this summer was an “initial response” to the militarisation of the islands.And, in response to a question, he said that “much larger consequences” were possible in the future if China did not find a way to work more collaboratively with others in the region.The US, he said, remained committed to ensuring free and open transit in the region.“Despite China’s claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapons systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,” Mattis said, referring to the recent deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers and other equipment on the Spratly Islands, and the landing of bomber aircraft at Woody Island.Mattis also struck at one of the key, longstanding disputes between the US and China, telling the conference that America will continue to provide defence equipment and services to Taiwan and oppose any effort to alter the status quo. China claims the self-governing island as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.But in a quick pivot, he said the US welcomed cooperation with China “wherever possible” and announced that he had accepted Beijing’s invitation to visit there soon. It remains to be seen if that invitation will stand after this conference.The Pentagon leader’s comments at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue came in the wake of a tumultuous few weeks between the US and China.Last week the US withdrew an invitation for Beijing to participate in an exercise known as Rim of the Pacific. China had participated in the exercise in 2014 and 2016.The Pentagon said the decision to disinvite the Chinese navy was triggered by what it called strong evidence that China has deployed weapons systems on the islands, and called on China to remove them. China says it is within its rights to build up defences on islands in the South China Sea that it believes are its sovereign territory.China’s activities, Mattis said in his speech Saturday, stand “in stark contrast to the openness of what our strategy promotes. It calls into question China’s broader goals.”In recent years the US had sought to stabilise military relations with China, but the militarisation of the islands has been a persistent point of conflict. Many nations fear that Beijing will use the construction on the islands to extend its military reach and potentially try to restrict navigation in the South China Sea.China has not sent high-level officials to the three-day meeting, in an apparent attempt to deflect attention from its campaign to expand its sovereignty across virtually the entire South China Sea.Mattis made clear that the US does not expect nations to choose between the US and China, adding that Beijing should have a voice in shaping the region, while allies have a voice in shaping China’s role.The US, he said, “will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperation when possible, and competing vigorously where we must”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09fc5c0784d539f70e88edfa367d5c86937a7c80/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b09c9b49da6a4f7c37c0b547125384b","title":"phenomenal ardern nz mothers to be on the birth of a new kind of prime minister","story":"Parents and prospective parents reflect on motherhood, child-rearing and what it means to have a prime minister who is doing it tooIn mid-June Jacinda Ardern will become the second serving prime minister in history to give birth while in office. Ardern will take six weeks’ leave after giving birth and when she returns to work her partner, Clarke Gayford, will become a stay-at-home-dad.Here, New Zealand women with babies due in the same month discuss what it means to have a pregnant prime minister, and how they will balance parenthood, work and a severe lack of sleep.Jaime Faulkner, 36, lives in the rural town of Kawakawa in the Bay of Islands. Married for 12 years to Nathan, a dairy farmer, Faulkner is expecting her fourth child – a girl – on 1 June. Together, the couple have five children. Nathan will not take any leave.“When I heard the news, I wondered if Jacinda and I were due around the same time. My initial response was ‘wow, I wonder if we went to the same party.’ I was so happy for her, she is a phenomenal woman and to do what she does – she runs the country. All I do is run a little tribe. I am excited for her to be a mum and to experience that. I mean it does my head in every now and then, and you wish you could just have that one day to just be you, but you’d never change what you have once you’ve got it.At home, my eldest is about to turn 16, then 15, then 13, then 12, then 7. I usually get home at midnight, then have a bit of a break and get to bed. Then it’s rinse, lather and repeat really. Once we found out, it was a matter of making it work. Basically with my mindset it is as easy or as hard as you make it.I didn’t do this with the other children, it wasn’t really an option. The midwives I have now, they are offering it more these days. It is becoming more of a common practice. I was talking to a young girl in town, and she said how can you work three jobs and be eight months pregnant and look after all your kids? Jacinda’s pregnancy will encourage people and say to them ‘give it a go, it’s not as hard as you think it is’.”Rosie Whitley-Harford, 27, and husband Adam Harford,31, own their own home in the provincial east coast town of Gisborne, in the North Island. Adam is a school teacher and Rosie is a qualified early childhood educator. They are expecting their first child on 10 June. Rosie: “We found out I was pregnant the day after I resigned. So that made it quite difficult. I was quite unwell for the first trimester, too, and then it dwindled off. It definitely wasn’t easy at the start. Adam would have to get up in the morning and do me Marmite on toast before I would even get out of bed.”Adam: “Yeah had to, because even if she put her feet on the ground before she got toast in her she’d have a bad day.”Rosie: “We know how important it is to have that one person at home. The first three years are so important. So we have decided to have me stay home, and maybe in a year’s time we can talk about me going back to work, or maybe I won’t want to.”Adam: “Yeah, we have kind of set ourselves up to function off my sole income. So if Rosie needs to stay home, if we want her to stay home, then she can. We know we’re not going to get to go out to dinner every weekend, but that’s the life we’ve set up because that’s more important to us.”Rosie: “Lots of people say after that paid parental leave stops, that’s when you realise how tight things can be.”Adam: “We are learning to live within our means. Our type of car is not exactly luxurious. We eat plain meals. We don’t get the best cuts of steak. We live pretty Kiwi I suppose.”Adam: “According to my collective agreement I get two days paid leave. I think if things go smoothly, a safe birth, we are hoping just for a week off eh?”Rosie: “Yeah. I think love is a really big thing. That is our biggest thing, to portray love and kindness, so that is nurtured in the child.”And a lot of people were quick to judge it, but at the end of the day she still has to live her life. She’s not just the prime minister.”Adam: “I wasn’t really concerned with any of the political nonsense or her being able to carry her role out, I was just happy for her as a person.Autumn Falk, a medical herbalist, and Jenni Werth, a former occupational therapist, own a medicinal tea business and live in Katikati, Bay of Plenty. They have a tea bar in a caravan which they take to markets and festivals. Autumn: “It has been a really long process. It was early on in our relationship that we decided we wanted to have children.”Jenni: “About six years ago we met the father who is a really good friend of ours. And pretty much asked him straightaway and he was like ‘yeah, no problem’. Then, when it came down to it, I think it was a bit more serious thought involved.”Autumn: “He will be involved in kind of an uncle position. Obviously, the child will know this is their father, yeah. He will definitely have involvement and come and go I guess.”Jenni: “He won’t have any decision-making rights around raising the baby, but he will definitely be involved.”Jenni: “I will be full-time mothering for the first year, then we will see how it goes, I have always wanted to parent, and Autumn is very content with going to work and providing. She is really happy doing that and I am happy being on the land and working in the gardens and being at home.”Autumn: “A lot of people speak to us and say ‘oh your baby is also due in June!’. Just like the prime minister’s one.”Jenni: “We haven’t followed her pregnancy to the extreme. I am more intrigued with how much of a difference it might make in her understanding of what it’s like to be a working mum – and she’s obviously at one extreme of the spectrum. I think we are really privileged in New Zealand to have a prime minister who is going to know what that’s like. Because a lot of the decisions that get made in this country are made by people who have no idea what it’s like to be in that situation, and to be outside of a situation and make decisions for a population … it’s a big ask. Autumn: “I find this quite an extraordinary situation. She is a woman, there are not many countries with leading women in power, and she is young enough to be able to have a child.

I really hope for her sake she doesn’t get over-scrutinised with how she manages. But I think it is going to inspire a lot of women.”Jenni: “I am worried about the lack of sleep.”Jenni: “It is probably way worse than everyone says.”Robin Burnell, 27, a franchise support worker for a cafe chain and her husband, Sam, 28, a plumber, live in Christchurch and are expecting their first child on 30 June.Robin: “I grew up really wanting a family. It was really important for both of us. I am just very clucky, very keen on children, very keen on babies.Change is always challenging, I think. And my normal becoming new is a little bit daunting. But I am really excited, too. A lot of people have talked about not realising how much love you could have for a baby until they are there.I plan to do six months off. And Sam would love a day at home with the baby as well.”Sam: “I would love to stay home. But it is all money related. If I can stay home I really want to.”I don’t think she is setting the bar too high, because every pregnancy is different. I just think she is very brave and confident. I think it would be awesome if the government reviewed how much paid parental leave is available to new parents. I know New Zealand is quite low down compared to other countries, which is hard when they don’t provide paid childcare until minimum two years old and most cases three years old.It is quite a strain. I think we have a lot of good things in New Zealand, but lengthening paid parental leave would definitely help.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505689.1527087516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in praise of aphid eating pollinators","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA hoverfly at tomato flowers: drawing by Michael  VineyFor me, summer will be confirmed when I am stopped in my tracks by a glint in the air a step or two ahead of me: a spark of pure sunlight with just a hint of colour, a tiny whirr of wings that makes a space shift sideways, or up or down in a sudden, quantum bilocation.The insect is showing off, staking out a territory and hoping for a mate, and if I can track it to a flower, the hint of colour will no doubt resolve into the imitative, wasp-bright, yellow and black markings of so many of Ireland’s hoverflies.Stingless, most no bigger than a thumbnail, hoverflies are a largely unsung legion among our insect pollinators. Evolution has woven them into the ersity of wildflowers, and the past 5,000 years have recruited their Irish range of species, some 180 strong.While the pollinating services of bumblebees and honeybees deserve their headlines, gardeners value hoverflies for another great benefit. Their larvae, hatched on plants, eat sap-sucking aphid pests rapaciously: they are “aphidophagous”.Outstanding in this respect is the common and much-studied Episyrphus balteatus, whose glowing orange body bands make it “the marmalade fly”. Laying perhaps 4,500 eggs in its lifetime in the heart of aphid colonies, it is the aphids’ most effective natural enemy, to be welcomed into cereal crops and tomato and strawberry tunnels. Welcomed, that is, by growers who prefer aphid control by hoverflies than the toxic protection of pesticides.Last year, as the termination of neonicotinoids was finally played out in Europe, shocking news of major insect decline was reported in Germany. A 27-year record of insect biomass in 63 nature protection areas showed a midsummer decline in flying insects of 82 per cent – a drop inexplicable in terms of habitat or weather.This is part of the wider decline in flying insects that leaves our car windscreens and headlights unnaturally clean at journey’s end. It threatens to worsen as climate change disrupts the insects’ habitats and range. But more immediate threats are posed by the intensive farmland they fly across on long-distance migration.The marmalade fly, for example, while native to Ireland for thousands of years, is also a determined migrant. Like some of our butterflies, it travels in huge numbers from the Mediterranean, arriving in July and August and spreading across the island.The first scientific record of this came in 1995, when two biologists in a boat off Courtmacsherry Bay in Co Cork saw skeins of hoverflies heading for the coast in company with clouds of red admirals. The flies were so numerous that dead ones were forming drift lines on the sea. Such mass arrivals have sometimes caused public panic, as on coasts of southeast England during a heatwave in 2004. Mistaking the hoverflies for wasps as the insects settled on them for a rest, children ran screaming, prams were covered up, and so on.As for their return to the south, a memorable observation came from a British ornithologist, David Lack. Climbing to a high, narrow pass in the Pyrenees to check the passage of migrating birds, he found a torrent of hoverflies, chiefly Episyrphus balteatus, pressing on at ankle height into the wind. What caught his eye was “a shimmer of iridescent light, due to the reflection of the autumn sun on myriad tiny wings”. Given the dire decline reported from Germany, I have to wonder how far hoverfly migrations through Europe to Britain and Ireland have already been hit by neonicotinoids. The marmalade is among the hoverflies attracted especially to the nectar of yellow flowers, like the sulphurous shades of fields of oilseed rape, prime candidate for systemic pesticides. Such threats crop up in the scientific bible of Europe’s hoverflies, Syrph-the-net, the remarkable database compiled and maintained by Dr Martin Speight, long the leading entomologist of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and now with Trinity College Dublin’s zoology department.For example, accompanying the marmalade fly among the “anthropophilic” (human-friendly) species is another migrant, Eristalis arbustorum (no English name), common in urban parks and gardens. But its appetite for the nectar of hedgerow plants takes it on to farmland, where its larvae mature in cow dung.Like other insects involved in recycling manure, its progressive decline has been blamed on dosing cattle with systemic chemicals, such as ivermectin, to kill parasitic worms.There are few common names among hoverflies and a great variety in size, shape and colouring: several dark ones look more like bees. There is much more about them at the Irish Pollinator Initiative hosted on the website of the National Bioersity Data Centre (bioersityireland.ie).This also offers species photographs, gives access to their accounts in Syrph-the-Net and welcomes new records of local hoverfly species. These may begin with that memorable pause, a few mesmerising moments, watching a hovering hoverfly doing its quantum thing."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute and HSE investigate how adult material featured on DVD for childrenGarda\u0026iacute recover MDMA and cannabis after searching man in Leixlip on Friday night\u0026lsquoInspiring and funny\u0026rsquo: Tributes paid to 15-year-olds Jack Kenneally, Shay MoloneyPew study shows 95 per cent of teens \u0026lsquonow say they have access to a smartphone\u0026rsquoThree fire brigade units dispatched to scene of blaze at home in SouthillYour questions answered about the debit and credit card problem that affected millionsOutage on Friday left customers in Ireland and Europe unable to make purchasesBank Holiday weather: Met \u0026Eacuteireann predicts scattered thunderstorms and spot floodingMan in 20s arrested in connection with fatal assault in Michelstown on Friday night\u0026lsquoI screamed and roared at his disappearance, and a nun slapped me right across the face\u0026rsquoMinister told support group he was committed to finding an interim solution pending new lawT\u0026aacutenaiste says EU Brexit group must receive written plans in advance of crunch summit\u0027When that photo was taken \u0026ndash it wasn\u0026rsquot a criminal offence to be a man.

Gardaí and the Health Service Executive are investigating how adult material featured on an educational DVD for primary school children. The inappropriate material featured in a Busy Bodies DVD distributed by the HSE to primary schools nationwide as an aid for children entering puberty.The material came to light on Thursday when primary school teacher viewed the DVD himself before showing it to pupils.The DVD was not viewed by children and it was removed from the school. The HSE’s Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme was notified and the HSE has reported the incident to the Department of Education and to gardaí, who are now investigating.The Busy Bodies programme is a booklet and DVD developmental aid providing information on the physical changes children experience entering adolescence. The resource is widely used by teachers and parents and is aimed at children aged between 10 and 14. The current batch of Busy Bodies DVD’s have been in circulation in schools for the past ten months and this is the first reported issue of concern, a HSE spokesperson said. Some 20,000 DVD’s have been ordered and distributed through schools nationwide since last August.“The Busy Bodies programme is a well-regarded and received, widely-used age appropriate resource for use in primary schools and some secondary schools. This is extremely disappointing,” the HSE spokesperson said. Investigations to identify how the adult material came to feature on the DVD will focus on areas of production and distribution. Helen Deely, HSE Programme Lead for Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy said: “Following our initial investigation, this appears to be an isolated incident relating to one inidual copy of the resource. “As a precaution, the HSE is writing to all schools and recipients of the resource, asking that they be returned to schools by parents, and removed from use and circulation until the investigation is complete,” she said.Parents with concerns are invited to contact the HSElive team Monday-Saturday, 8am-8pm, on 1850 24 1850 or email hselive@hse.ie.

The Government has said substantial progress on the Border, including the so-called “backstop”, must be made by this summit.“In the next two weeks, we need to see written proposals,” Mr Coveney told The . “It needs to happen two weeks from the summit.”Mr Coveney’s warning reflects increasing exasperation in Dublin and Brussels that no firm proposals have emerged from London, with just weeks until the summit.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Coveney and other senior Ministers such as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe have repeatedly told their UK counterparts that such proposals are needed soon.“There’s a new idea or solution being mooted every week,” said a senior Government source, adding that Dublin was only “interested in proposals that are written down”.“On paper like. Or on a screen. We are at legal text stage. We need legal texts to draft and debate.”A leaked proposal on Friday from UK Brexit secretary David Davis – that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a “buffer zone” to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland – was dismissed by Government figures.The latest proposals were also dismissed by the Democratic Unionist Party which urged its Conservative partners in the UK government to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on how to deal with the Border question.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.On the buffer zone, one Government source in Dublin said it only moved a potential physical border, rather than ensuring that no physical border would be in place after Brexit.The UK and EU are due to agree a withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, by October, but the Government has warned this will be thrown into doubt unless substantial progress is made this month.The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.“If there is no progress on the backstop, we are in for an uncertain summer,” Mr Coveney said. “At this point we need written proposals on the Irish backstop consistent with what was agreed.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Photograph: Getty Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis is creating a Brexit plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the border that would be in effect for local traders, like dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, the newspaper said. The Department of Foreign Affairs offered no comment on the specific proposal in a statement released in response to the plan the UK’s Brexit secretary is reportedly creating. Instead it urged Britain to engage with the EU “in a more detailed way” on the parts of the draft Brexit treaty relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the “backstop” option that would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and single market if no other solution was found to avoid a hard border.“At this stage in the process, the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop,” said a spokesman for the department.“The engagement must be through the formal negotiation with the Task Force, led by Michel Barnier. The Tánaiste and Irish officials are in ongoing contact with the EU Task Force team.”Mr Davis’s plan is a revision of the “max fac” or “maximum facilitation” plan, the report said, citing a source.British prime minister Theresa May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options.One would be “max fac” in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.The other option being considered is a “customs partnership”, according to which the UK would co-operate with the EU more closely and collect tariffs on its behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border.The European Union previously criticised Ms May for not setting out how the UK would achieve a frictionless border with the EU without erecting a land border to control goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Britain suggested earlier this month that it would be willing to extend the use of EU tariffs as a backstop if there were delays in ratification of a Brexit deal to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, adding the government did not want to use that option. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce dismissed the idea of a 10-mile Border buffer zone being considered by the UK government as “unworkable.”“Moving the problem of the Border to 10 miles away won’t solve the problem,” said John McGrane, the director-general of the chamber. “All that will happen in a dual-territory model is added costs of complying with double regulations - and more costs means less jobs.”The chamber was “aghast” that, with the clock on negotiations “ticking down daily towards a potential hard Brexit,” that the UK government is still not saying clearly how it will deliver a borderless future for trade both northsouth and eastwest between the UK and Ireland, he said. - additional reporting - ReutersNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516834.1527886340!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup dismisses uk government s half cooked ideas on border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP MP Sammy Wilson said  none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. File image: Leon NealAFPGetty ImagesThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has urged the British Conservative Party to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on dealing with the Border and to provide clarity on its Brexit plan.Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis was reported on Thursday to be creating a plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the Border that would be in effect for local traders, such as dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, The Sun newspaper reported.A 10-mile wide “special economic zone” would be created along the 310-mile border, within which local traders could operate under the Republic’s trade rules.The DUP, which props up British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government at Westminster, has made clear that it does not want Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.He said: “First of all, to suggest that Northern Ireland be tied to both EU and UK regulations, when one of the objectives of leaving the single market is to allow the UK to set its own regulations, raises the question which regulations apply to Northern Ireland if and when the UK and the EU regulations erge?“Secondly, who will make the judgement as to which regulations should apply? Will it be the EU or the UK Government? Will it be the UK courts or the European Court of Justice?”Mr Wilson said the purpose of the border buffer zone “appears to be even less clear”. He asked what would happen to trade from outside the buffer zone when it crossed into the zone and if checks would have to be carried out there.Mr Wilson said the British Government must make it clear that all of the borders that would exist as a consequence of Britain leaving the EU “whether that is between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, the Irish Republic and Great Britain, or Great Britain and Europe all present the same problems”.He concluded: “Instead of moving from one set of half-cooked ideas to the other it is now time for the Government to put down its foot and make it clear to EU negotiators that the Prime Minister stands by her commitment that no deal is better than a bad deal and if they want to avoid the consequences then they need to stop dismissing the perfectly feasible ideas that were put forward in August of last year.”Sinn Féin accused Mr Davis of trying to “hide a hard border in a buffer zone”.MEP Martina Anderson said: “Once again this shows the lack of knowledge of border areas and the concerns they face - David Davis obviously didn’t learn much on his flying visits.”Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU did not deny that the proposal was under consideration.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has been absolutely clear that we cannot and will not accept a customs border down the Irish Sea, and that we will preserve the integrity of the UK’s common market.” - Additional reporting PANegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland

I told him how much he was loved, how much he would be missed and how proud we all were of him, amongst lots of other things.I also made a number of promises to him. Ones that I will never break. And one of those promises I made was that no matter what happens, I would always care for and look after his gorgeous mummy for him.So I asked Connie if she would do me the honour of becoming my wife and sharing mine and our beautiful son\u0027s surname. And she said YES!!!When the day comes that we get married, the most important person to us will not be there, but don\u0027t worry, he\u0027ll be up there watching, hopefully with a big smile on his face. We love you Charlie and your legacy will carry on.Mr Gard and Ms Yates have launched a foundation to invest in medical research and support families with sick children.The death of Charlie Gard came after a legal battle between his parents and the Great Ormond Street HospitalThe foundation will be funded with more than £1.3 million, which they raised to pay for their baby’s planned experimental therapy.The couple say they also want to raise awareness about mitochondrial depletion syndrome, which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage.“Our vision is to enhance the quality of life for mitochondrial sufferers through innovative research, family support, and raise much-needed awareness for this devastating condition,” they said in a statement on the Charlie Gard Foundation website.“Mitochondrial-related diseases kill more children than childhood cancers, and it’s our vision to change this statistic.”Single-engine plane lands on road in California after losing powerItaly puts on a show of unity as Brussels diplomats warn new government against \u0026#39hitting negotiating table with a fist\u0026#39Royal Navy warship follows Russian spy vessel through the English ChannelMob murders: accused appears in court in SalfordSocialist Pedro Sanchez sworn in as new Spanish PMJeremy Thorpe \u0026#39hit-man may still be alive\u0026#39, as investigation reopenedAerial footage shows new cracks at Halema‘uma‘u crater after Kilauea eruptionScientists develop method which could help regenerate tooth enamel Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack US Defense Secretary Mattis accuses China of \u0026#39intimidation and coercion\u0026#39 in South China SeaTrafford Park crash: Woman dies after car ploughs into pedestrians  in Manchester hit-and-runFive dead, nearly 200 ill in US romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak Police smash plot to smuggle £4m worth of cannabis into UKBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 5: stuffed with potential stars, the show finally finds its form ahead of the finalFitbits could help save the lives of thousands of chemotherapy patients La Macarena could be the answer to staying alive, heart study findsBenedict Cumberbatch fights off four muggers who attacked Deliveroo cyclist near Baker StreetHMRC\u0026#39s spend on consultants rises by 9,000pc as MPs attack \u0026#39staggering\u0026#39 cost increaseScotland \u0026#39could be hit with more tax hikes\u0026#39 after sudden £389 million budget fallHow Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39Virtual Wards\u0026#39 could hold the key to keeping elderly patients out of hospital We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/02/TELEMMGLPICT000163555000_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJI8IQ9zNFHlX4m6wWDBpedmmtNkNjn4JYvx2MpkSMlQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"scientists develop method could help regenerate tooth enamel","story":"The discovery could help tackle tooth decayScientists say they have developed a material which could help regenerate tooth enamel -

the first to do so.The Socialist leader must still name his cabinet and it is only when their names are published in an official government journal in the coming days that he will fully assume his functions.Spain\u0026#39s new Prime Minister and Socialist party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez walks during his swearing in ceremony at the Zarzuela Palace in MadridHis ousting of EU-friendly Rajoy, a 63-year-old veteran politician who had been in power since 2011, comes at a time of political instability in Europe as Italy brings in a new eurosceptic anti-establishment government.But even if he will head up a minority government with support of a hodgepodge of disparate parties like far-left Podemos and Catalan separatists, Sanchez has promised his main priority will be to respect Madrid\u0027s deficit reduction commitments to the European Union.He has also vowed to implement the 2018 budget designed by Rajoy\u0027s conservative Popular Party (PP) government.His arrival at the prime minister\u0027s office represents an astounding comeback for the man who led the Socialists to two crushing general elections defeats in 2015 and 2016, and was forced out by the party apparatus.That was short-lived, though, as party activists re-elected him as party head in primaries in May 2017, but even then the Socialists were often sidelined as Podemos, centre-right Ciudadanos and Rajoy\u0027s PP took centre stage in politics.Spain\u0026#39s socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, left, poses with King Felipe VI, center and former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after the swearing in ceremony at the Zarzuela Palace on the outskirts of Madrid, Spain,That all changed on May 25 when the Socialists filed a no-confidence motion against Rajoy, a day after a court found former PP officials guilty of receiving bribes in exchange for awarding public contracts in a vast graft scheme between 1999 and 2005.Other opposition parties lined up against Rajoy, who was abandoned by his allies too.An absolute majority of 180 lawmakers voted for the motion on Friday to loud applause and shouts of Yes we can.It\u0027s been an honour - there is none bigger - to have been Spain\u0027s prime minister, Rajoy told parliament minutes before.In his first comments after winning the no-confidence motion, Sanchez, a former basketball player, vowed to tackle all the challenges which the country faces with humility.But he will struggle to govern as his Socialists have just 84 seats in the 350-seat parliament.All of his allies in the no-confidence motion stressed their vote against Rajoy was not a blank cheque for Sanchez.Spanish new Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (L) shakes hands with former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (R) after Sanchez won the no-confidence motionOur \u0027Yes\u0027 to Sanchez is a \u0027No\u0027 to Rajoy, is how Joan Tarda of Catalan pro-independence party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) put it in parliament.Sanchez will only be able to implement policy initiatives that allow him to obtain an easy majority in parliament, said Fernando Vallespin, political scientist at the Autonomous University of Madrid.PP lawmaker Rafael Hernando said Sanchez would be entering the prime minister\u0027s office through the back door after failing to win any general elections.Sanchez has already tied his hands by promising to respect Rajoy\u0027s 2018 budget, which includes generous concessions to the northern Basque region.He has also said he wants to build bridges with Catalonia\u0027s new separatist government, headed by Quim Torra, which will take office on Saturday.The parties that supported Sanchez will make demands he will not meet, predicted Pedro Fernandez, a 68-year-old pensioner, outside of parliament.When he does not do what they want, they will remind him that they brought him to power. And in five or six months we will either have fresh elections or they will oust him, he added.Italy puts on a show of unity as Brussels diplomats warn new government against \u0026#39hitting negotiating table with a fist\u0026#39Royal Navy warship follows Russian spy vessel through the English ChannelMob murders: accused appears in court in SalfordJeremy Thorpe \u0026#39hit-man may still be alive\u0026#39, as investigation reopenedCharlie Gard\u0026#39s parents announce their engagementAerial footage shows new cracks at Halema‘uma‘u crater after Kilauea eruptionScientists develop method which could help regenerate tooth enamel Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack US Defense Secretary Mattis accuses China of \u0026#39intimidation and coercion\u0026#39 in South China SeaTrafford Park crash: Woman dies after car ploughs into pedestrians  in Manchester hit-and-runFive dead, nearly 200 ill in US romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak Police smash plot to smuggle £4m worth of cannabis into UKBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 5: stuffed with potential stars, the show finally finds its form ahead of the finalLa Macarena could be the answer to staying alive, heart study findsFitbits could help save the lives of thousands of chemotherapy patients Benedict Cumberbatch fights off four muggers who attacked Deliveroo cyclist near Baker StreetScotland \u0026#39could be hit with more tax hikes\u0026#39 after sudden £389 million budget fallHMRC\u0026#39s spend on consultants rises by 9,000pc as MPs attack \u0026#39staggering\u0026#39 cost increaseHow Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39Virtual Wards\u0026#39 could hold the key to keeping elderly patients out of hospital Student becomes fifth Grenfell Tower fraudster to be convictedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"us defense secretary mattis accuses china intimidation coercion","story":"China\u0027s military build-up in the South China Sea and its deployment of high-end weapons systems in the disputed waterway is designed to intimidate and coerce neighbours, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Saturday.Speaking at a high-profile security summit in Singapore, the Pentagon chief also said the US military continues to support diplomats pushing for the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Mattis said Beijing had deployed a range of military hardware including anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and electronic jammers across the South China Sea, where it has built islets and other maritime features into hardened military facilities.U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis delivers his speech during the first plenary session of the 17th International Institute for Strategic StudiesBeijing has also landed heavy bombers on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands.Despite China\u0027s claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion, Mattis told the Shangri-La Dialogue.He also called out Chinese President Xi Jinping for reneging on a 2015 promise made at the White House that Beijing would not militarise the island features in the South China Sea.Mattis\u0027 address in Singapore was the second time he had attended the summit since becoming Pentagon chief.He returned to a theme that he and other senior US officials have hammered since President Donald Trump took office - that America is here to stay in the Asia-Pacific region and that allies should stick with Washington instead of aligning with Beijing.Australia\u0026#39s Defence Minister Marise Payne, China\u0026#39s PLA Lieutenant-General He Lei and Canada\u0026#39s Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan listens to US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u0026#39 addressBut the message of inclusivity, cooperation and working with allies might be a tougher sell for Mattis, who is generally popular on the international scene, after his boss this week imposed metals tariffs on some of America\u0027s closest allies in the name of national security.Most countries in the region which are part of the global supply chain are anxious that they will be impacted by a trade war between China and the US, said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.In a dig at China, which the Pentagon has accused of using predatory economics to exploit neighbours, Mattis said the US supports the peaceful resolution of disputes, free, fair and reciprocal trade and investment and adherence to international rules and norms.Despite frequent warnings from Washington about China\u0027s rising might and the pitfalls of its Belt and Road global infrastructure initiative, Beijing has faced few consequences for its South China Sea buildup and sweeping territorial claims.One modest exception came last week when the Pentagon disinvited China from biennial maritime exercises in the Pacific. Mattis characterised this action as an initial response.Delegates hoping for clarity on Trump\u0027s intentions for a scheduled June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not get much from Mattis.He has steadfastly avoided weighing in on the issue, deferring questions to the State Department and Trump\u0027s national security team.On the Korean peninsula, we hold the line with our allies, supporting our diplomats who lead this effort, Mattis said.Our objective remains the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Please review our commenting policyItaly puts on a show of unity as Brussels diplomats warn new government against \u0026#39hitting negotiating table with a fist\u0026#39Royal Navy warship follows Russian spy vessel through the English ChannelMob murders: accused appears in court in SalfordSocialist Pedro Sanchez sworn in as new Spanish PMJeremy Thorpe \u0026#39hit-man may still be alive\u0026#39, as investigation reopenedCharlie Gard\u0026#39s parents announce their engagementAerial footage shows new cracks at Halema‘uma‘u crater after Kilauea eruptionScientists develop method which could help regenerate tooth enamel Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand says she was \u0026#39crying out inside\u0026#39 in first interview about attack Trafford Park crash: Woman dies after car ploughs into pedestrians  in Manchester hit-and-runFive dead, nearly 200 ill in US romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak Police smash plot to smuggle £4m worth of cannabis into UKBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 5: stuffed with potential stars, the show finally finds its form ahead of the finalLa Macarena could be the answer to staying alive, heart study findsFitbits could help save the lives of thousands of chemotherapy patients Benedict Cumberbatch fights off four muggers who attacked Deliveroo cyclist near Baker StreetScotland \u0026#39could be hit with more tax hikes\u0026#39 after sudden £389 million budget fallHMRC\u0026#39s spend on consultants rises by 9,000pc as MPs attack \u0026#39staggering\u0026#39 cost increaseHow Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39Virtual Wards\u0026#39 could hold the key to keeping elderly patients out of hospital Student becomes fifth Grenfell Tower fraudster to be convictedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"kanye west ye new album tracks what we know","story":"One guest feature had no idea he was on the album until this week\u0027s listening partyKanye West is releasing his new album 1 on June, as promised, following a public listening session\u0026nbspthat took place in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with a live-stream of the event being shared with the rest of the world via the WAV app.\u0026nbspYe has yet to surface on streaming platforms but there\u0027s already plenty to be gleaned from the listening party.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And a decision will have to be made as to whether we accept it or not.”It adds: “It cannot be right that 650 MPs alone decide whether to accept the deal, without any say for Londoners or people across the country. That’s why we think it’s essential that there is a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, so that 65 million people can have their voices heard as well.”The letter sets out the need to stop Brexit from damaging London’s status as “a cultural capital, a sporting powerhouse” and “a hub for international business, civil society and media”.While it accepts that the 2016 referendum gave the government a mandate to negotiate a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, it says ministers do not have a mandate to “force a bad Brexit deal on our city.”It argues that London, “represents all the most positive elements of being global, outward-looking, welcoming and tolerant. These values form part of the fabric of London. A bad Brexit deal risks tearing that fabric apart.”Up to now Mr Corbyn has doggedly resisted the idea of a public vote on the final deal, saying that the country should “respect” the result of the referendum in June 2016.Ten of the MPs went further\u0026nbspand backed a call for an option in any referendum to be remaining in the EU on current terms.Labour HQ declined to comment on Friday, but the Labour membership, which twice backed Mr Corbyn to lead the party, is believed to be largely against Brexit.While the exact geographical breakdown of Labour’s membership is not public data, insiders say numbers are heavily weighted towards London and other urban centres.Mr Corbyn and the most senior members of his shadow cabinet, like John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Emily Thornberry, Barry Gardiner and Sir Keir Starmer all hold seats in the capital, which overwhelmingly backed Remain in the referendum.It comes after 12 Welsh Labour MPs, including shadow ministerial aides Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi, both defied the party line to sign a similar letter.Five MPs from Labour’s heartlands in the Northeast also signed a letter published by The Independent in May calling for backing the People’s Vote campaign, as did four\u0026nbspMerseyside\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspand the city’s mayor.Last month Janet Daby\u0026nbspdefeated rivals supported by the Corbyn-backing Momentum group and Unite to become Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the Lewisham East byelection next month, having stood on a ticket of fighting to keep the UK in the single market.Anti-Brexit left-wingers announced they will\u0026nbsptour\u0026nbspBritain this summer in a campaign to build opposition to leaving the EU – calling on Mr Corbyn to back Remain and negotiate a “new settlement” with Brussels.The internal struggle in the party could come to a head when the Commons votes on whether to keep the UK in the single market in coming weeks, with Mr Corbyn currently refusing to back the plan.Labour’s current position is that that Britain’s EU membership must end and that the country should leave the\u0026nbspsingle market\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcustoms union\u0026nbspto negotiate new relationships to replace them.But the House of Lords, including more than 80 Labour peers who rebelled against Mr Corbyn’s will, passed an amendment to Theresa May’s EU Withdrawal Bill that would see the UK remain inside the single market if it also now gets approved by the Commons.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Firstly, set up an independent inquiry – we must investigate\u0026nbspinstances of Islamophobic conduct and isolate them swiftly,” Lord Sheikh says in the letter seen by The Independent.\u0026nbsp“…Secondly the Prime Minister should reach out to all outreach groups of the Conservative party such as the Conservative Muslim Forum and actively engage in dialogue.”\u0026nbspThe comments come days after The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed that the story that the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) had written to the Conservative Party to launch an urgent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party.The organisation, which represents more than 500 mosques, schools and associations in Britain, has urged the party to conduct a full audit to tackle the “more than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia from candidates and representatives of the party”.Mr Sheikh said the MCB\u0026nbspletter came “as no surprise to me and should not come as a surprise to the party either”.\u0026nbspThe MCB’s letter cited 10 examples of Islamophobia by members of the party that have been revealed in an eight-week period since 5 April.\u0026nbspHarun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “The Conservative Party prides itself in being against any form of bigotry and racism yet there are serious concerns that its best values are being disfigured by Islamophobic views.\u0026nbsp“We look forward to the party taking forward our suggestion of an inquiry into Islamophobia and we are happy to help support in any capacity we can.”Days after the MCB’s call for an inquiry,\u0026nbspa Tory councillor was suspended after he allegedly posted comments about London mayor Sadiq Khan, The Independent revealed.\u0026nbspStephen Ardley, a councillor on the Waveney District Council, allegedly said it was “unbelievable” that a Muslim had been elected and went on to describe those who voted for him as “blind”.“I think it’s unbelievable that a Muslim was actually elected the Mayor of this great Christian country – oh wait he’s labour so the blind just vote red and left, he posted on Facebook.\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This should be greater than current non-EU precedents, recognising the quality and breadth of the UK\u0026rsquos contribution.However, the EU refused to discuss the issue and presented the UK with conditions for a third country into its multi-billion pound research programme.The UK will be given a non-EU status like Canada and South Korea, and will have to pay a higher price for the privilege of collaborating with Brussels.As a third country, Britain will not have a seat on the new European Innovation Council, banning them from participating in innovative programmes.Dr Chris Leigh, astrophysics researcher in Liverpool, who is heavily involved in collaborative EU science programmes declared that UK\u0027s science will still triumph, despite EU\u0027s new restrictions.He said: Although there may be some science programmes and activities that rely heavily on Horizon 2020 funding, as a whole, EU research programmes only fund around three percent of UK research and development activity.\u0026nbspSo the impact of any significant change in our scientific relationship with the EU would in reality be very small. Dr Leigh added that collaborative efforts with EU scientists will still go on, and that Brussels\u0027 new policy will not restrict their freedom to innovate and engage with European researches in future projects.He said: At the end of the day, the UK has the strongest scientific and educational base in Europe, so I\u0027ve no doubt that our talented researchers will continue to thrive, whether as an associate or a third country within future EU research programmes.\u0026nbspWe also have to remember that we collaborate with many EU members through intergovernmental research programmes (i.e outside EU structures), such as the European Space Agency, CERN, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the European Southern Observatory and many more.\u0026nbspI\u0027m pretty confident that UK scientists will continue to collaborate widely with colleagues around Europe, even if we see reduced access to EU programmes.EU Commission negotiators announced that Britain would have to pay more to remain in Brussels\u0027 \u0026pound86billion (\u0026euro97.9bn) research programme by giving them the lower status.According to a draft copy of the Horizon Europe document, world class scientists in the UK will not be granted a less generous offer than other non-EU states, including Israel.The Horizon 2020 programme is Europe\u0027s biggest research and innovation scheme where member states and associated countries take part in funded cooperative research and science collaborations."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/child-bank-account-trust-fund-968254.jpg","title":"child bank account trust fund junior isa child trust fund","story":" STOCKYour child could have \u0026pound1,000 in a Child Trust FundThe money in the account comes from the last Labour government, which introduced a saving scheme called the Child Trust Fund - a long-term tax-free savings account for children.If your child was born between September 1, 2002, and January 2, 2011, they could have up to \u0026pound1,000 in savings sitting in a bank account in their name.Here\u0027s how the scheme worked: An initial \u0026pound250 voucher was given to parents when the opened the account.The government would then add an additional \u0026pound250 when the child turned seven years old.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT.

Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its lavishly-funded Remainer stooges aim to do the same with Brexit.How does Brussels think this all ends?If Brexit is negated there will be a collapse of faith in democracy and probable civil unrest beyond anyone’s experience.In Italy, eurosceptic parties will now have an even bigger mandate.

It dived down and up again and dived and disappeared.It was not a boat. I would say it was Nessie.”The Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register, which keeps a record of every possible glimpse of Nessie, believes Eoin filmed the real deal.Gary Campbell, keeper of the sightings register, said: As far as Nessie footage goes, this is a feature film.Normally you only get videos of one or two seconds. It is remarkable in its length.Clearly it is something that dives in and out of the surface with water splashes and reflections.But wider interest wasnt sparked until 1933 after a road was built along the loch, making it far less isolated.Within months, several people came forward claiming to have seen a giant beast lurking near the water.Theories reached fever pitch a year later when the infamous surgeon’s photograph - probably the best-known image of the creature - emerged.But in 1975 the famous shot was exposed as a hoax, made using a toy submarine with a carved monster’s head.There have now been over 1,000 reported sightings.In 2017, the story of the Loch Ness monster topped a poll of the UKs greatest unexplained mysteries.The object would be no larger than 20ft.”It follows nine sightings of the elusive beast in the last year alone.Just last week, eight-year-old Laria Annand and her gran Marie claimed to have caught Nessie on camera while going for a paddle in the iconic lake."},{"url":null,"title":"inverness primary school ends boy girl only races sports day","story":"Students at Merkinch Primary School in Inverness can now only compete in mixed races.The decision comes just weeks after new guidelines to improve inclusion for pupils who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex was sent out by the Highland Council.But some parents have raised concerns children could face more bullying by the move - while others said it was a clumsy attempt at addressing the matter of inclusion.Mother-of-two Melissa Watson said: “It was a big talking point for me and my mates.There was a race between five girls and one boy and he came last and all the boys were like ‘Ha ha,, you got beaten by a girl’.In my eyes this opens the kids up to being bullied.“Why doesn’t the school just let the LGBTI children race with the sex that they feel they belong to, instead of making all the kids run mixed races?”Another mum, who did not want to be named, added: The world has gone mad. I feel for the children in 10-15 years.I dread to think what it’s going to be like.”Other critics pointed out races at a competitive level were not mixed.Del McClurg is chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council and her grandchildren attend Merkinch Primary.The official guidelines were produced by LGBT Youth Scotland and tell teachers not to deny or overly question trans childrens choices over gender identity.It advises that if the child does not want to inform their parents or carers of their trans identity it is best to not to disclose information.The report adds that schoolkids as young as three should be supported to explore and express their identity regardless of their age.The document also says parents should not be told if their children are sharing rooms with trans pupils on school trips.She said she had “mixed feelings” about the move.Del added: “I think the school needs to explain this to the parents,” she said.“The Olympics don’t do mixed-gender competition sports.”But the school said they had mostly received praise from parents by the change.Headteacher Judith Kean was unavailable for interview but in a written response she confirmed races were mixed at the sports day held this week and that feedback from parents and children had been positive.Hugh Torrance, director of Leadership, Equality and Active Participation (LEAP) in Sports Scotland, which published the guidelines emailed by Highland Council to all schools, said: “The guidance has come about as a result of LGBTI pupils working together with schools to try and address some particularly difficult issues that pupils have experienced within physical education in particular.“We have suggested that pupils should not be segregated according to sex unless it’s necessary.“The evidence points to there being no differences between the genders when it comes to sport pre-puberty.But the manifesto is not saying that we need to do away with gender segregation completely in sport. That’s not how the world is set up at the moment.”Morgan Cowley, former chairman of the Highland LGBTI forum which campaigns for the fair treatment of all LGBTI people, said: “I think introducing non-gender specific sports days into schools is rather a clumsy way of trying to address the crux of the matter within our schools, which is promoting respect for one another and celebrating difference.“There are undoubtedly more astute ways of doing this and what Merkinch Primary is doing seems to be increasing conflict rather than reducing it.“Trying to promote nongender specific sports into schools at this point in our society’s development, when the whole world celebrates and enjoys gender-specific sport at the highest levels, seems a hard sell.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005058965-e1527844664660.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"netflix menu kate middleton escorts film menu","story":"The gaffe saw the Duchess of Cambridge kissing Prince William on the top half but the bottom half of the image was spliced with a tattooed girl in racy stockings and lace underwear.The snap, posted on Reddit by Big_Miss_Steak_, was meant to advertise documentary The Royals, which features interviews with those close to the family.But it somehow got mixed up with racy film Escorts, which is billed as provocative and steamy by Netflix.The shows synopsis reads: Get an unflinching look at two high-priced call girls who rely on the internet to find clients, and the effects of their lifestyle on their families.The shot was posted on Reddit with the caption: The risqué side of Netflix.

Barnier is a mutual acquaintance.”A source added: “Barnier met Best for Britain supporters in recent months.”But former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: “This tells you all you need to know about the Best for Britain campaign.“It is nothing to do with Britain, but instead focused on people outside of Britain for the benefit of people outside of Britain.”The Brexiteer added: “It is classically anti-Brexit and it is time for citizens of nowhere and everywhere to stop interfering with British politics.“Stay out of it, and stop trying to overturn the democratic will of the British people.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Me and the soon-to-be Mrs Gard will make sure of it.Mr Gard and Ms Yates, who are in their 30s and come from Bedfont, west London, had asked the High Court to rule that Charlie should be allowed to undergo a therapy trial in New York.Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London said the therapy would not help and said life-support treatment should stop.Mr Justice Francis ruled in favour of Great Ormond Street after analysing the case at hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London.Charlies parents failed to overturn the ruling in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.They also failed to persuade European Court of Human Rights judges to intervene.The couple raised more than £1.3million to pay for therapy in America and said they wanted to establish a foundation with the donations.Charlie suffered from a rare genetic condition, called mitochondrial depletion syndrome, which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage.His parents say they want to raise awareness of the condition by launching their foundation.Our vision is to enhance the quality of life for mitochondrial sufferers through innovative research, family support, and raise much-needed awareness for this devastating condition, they said in a statement on the Charlie Gard Foundation website.Mitochondrial-related diseases kill more children than childhood cancers, and its our vision to change this statistic.Our aims are to deliver hope for a brighter future - and one day find that all-elusive cure - and ensure we provide mito sufferers with every opportunity to get the very best out of life.They also promised to be there for families at every stage of your journey and recognise that memory making and family time is of the utmost importance."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000410186012.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"aureus school oxfordshire bans packed lunches halal gluten","story":"Aureus School in Didcot, Oxford, has sparked fury among parents for its strict stance on its food policy.But executive headteacher Hannah Wilson maintains she’s merely encouraging kids to eat healthy food amid concerns about obesity.She said pupils and staff dine together in the canteen, making lunchtimes a social affair.The teacher told the Oxford Mail : Food education closes the poverty gap and delicious, nutritious should be a universal entitlement.With all of the headlines about food banks and obesity, we are preparing our students for healthy lifestyles in the future.Students and staff get to choose from eating a hot halal meat meal, hot gluten-free vegetarian meal, a jacket potato, a salad, a pasta pot or a baguette.And the school insists that only water may be drunk on site because “hydrated brains learn better”.But a father, who asked not to be named, said the rules were “draconian”.He said: We are thinking of taking her out of the school - its getting silly and more like a dictatorship. Their views are quite extreme.Its about choice. Its supposed to be an inclusive school but they are only catering for one particular religion.The dad added that he had tried to get the policies changed since September but had been unsuccessful.The schools frequently-asked questions addresses the food policies and states: What we eat is a key influencer on our performance.When we eat well, we sleep well, when we sleep well, we perform well.We strive at Aureus to create good habits that will become lifelong routines.Sitting down to eat together once a day is an important part of our school culture and ethos.All staff sit and eat, but also bond and talk, with our students. These relationships are key in nurturing our school community.By ensuring that all students have access to a daily nutritious home-cooked family meal we ensure that all have this equality of opportunity.Reiterating the Halal kitchen policy, the document states this is to “celebrate the diversity of our country’s culture”.In 2013 a Government-backed report compiled by the founders of restaurant chain Leon encouraged more headteachers to consider banning packed lunches.It stated: We were approached by many free schools who wanted advice on setting up a first-class food service.Among other things, we always advised them to ban packed lunches from the start.The report noted the rising obesity rates with children and added: Many parents mistakenly imagine that a packed lunch is the healthiest option.In fact, it is far easier to get the necessary nutrients into a cooked meal – even one of mediocre quality.Only one per cent of packed lunches meet the nutritional

the second week in June, according to reports.Heatwave conditions over Europe will wash over Britain sending temperatures soaring in parts, according to WeatherAction forecaster Piers Corbyn.He told the Express: It is from the second week of the month onwards when we expect to see a return to heatwave conditions, very hot weather is expected over Europe and some of that is going to influence the UK.Temperatures could hit 30C next weekend, so apart from a slightly cooler start and end to the month we expect a blazing June of sunshine and dry weather.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the paper: “Forecasts into the start of the meteorological summer reveal a settled pattern of warm to hot temperatures with no give until at least mid-June.“We expect it to turn increasingly warmer through the first week of the month with many parts of the country basking in temperatures in the mid 20Cs.It could be rather muggy and humid with some variable cloud cover, but when the sun does come out it will feel extremely hot as summer gets underway.”And according to the Met Office, while showers may continue in some parts through the weekend, warm weather will bring a much drier, fresh start to the week with plenty of sunshine on Monday.But despite Wednesday and Thursday seeing a good deal of fine weather, with sunny spells for much of the UK, there is a risk that scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms could affect the far south and southeast at times, the Met Office has said.For the long range forecast for the rest of the month, the Met Office said: Through the second weekend of June, theres a risk of thundery showers in parts of the southwest and west, but many southern and eastern areas stay largely dry, although it may become more generally unsettled in the west later that Sunday.It looks as though the second half of June will probably start changeable with showers or perhaps longer spells of rain, these interspersed with drier periods.While temperatures may be close to or a little above normal for a time, there will be an ongoing risk that warm, humid and perhaps thundery conditions will spread across the UK from the continent.The last week of the month may become more generally settled, with a chance of warm temperatures and more sunshine for many."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000410415373.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"epsom derby day 2018 races celebrities bets latest","story":"The

Some women and girls are forced to sell sex to survive, and others are raped in times of conflict and catastrophe growing more frequent due to climate change, the 78-year old Canadian author said at a London conference. Of course, those kind of events give rise to civil unrest, wars, resource wars, battles for water, said the author of the 1985 novel The Handmaid\u0027s Tale. Women under those situations will suffer disproportionately, and their children, she said.   Police bodycam footage reveals what really happened before young mum, 20, was punched in head during beach arrest  Atwood\u0027s popular novel imagines a totalitarian future when fertile women are forced into sexual servitude to repopulate a world facing environmental disaster.

Research has shown that women\u0027s vulnerabilities are exposed during the chaos of cyclones, earthquakes and floods, according to the British think-tank Overseas Development Institute. If there is no civil protection and you don\u0027t have any money, what is the one thing that gets traded, always? In war conditions, rape is used a military tactic, Atwood said at the conference on women and climate change hosted by Invisible Dust, an arts and science organisation.  The Handmaid\u0027s Tale star Elisabeth Moss has final say on nude scenes - and was gleeful over graphic moments    Inside Fenway Park - The Handmaid\u0027s Tale transformed stadium into site of gruesome torture  Swelling populations and food demands, combined with even scarcer water and land resources, could lead to a doubling of food prices and trigger civil unrest in some developing countries, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has said. Such scenarios already have played out in North Africa, the Middle East and South East and South Asia, according to a 2016 report by UNEP and Global Footprint Network. Atwood said she was optimistic for the future but warned that many people have grown complacent about the impacts of climate change. It doesn\u0027t usually click for them until the floodwaters sweep into their house, said the Booker Prize-winning author. The problems are multiple, but I appreciate that people are tackling it, she said.

Leader Marine Le Pen announced at a conference in Lyon that 80.1 per cent of those who took part in a poll approved the change to Rassemblement National, or National Rally. The work of reinvention that we have undertaken continues more than ever, she said hailing what she described as a ‘great strategic, technical and political change.’ This big renovation will continue until December. It’s an emotional moment, and we will relish it. Le Pen, 49, is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 89-year-old founder of the party who is a convicted racist, anti-Semite and Holocaust denier.  He created the FN in 1972 as a populist nationalist movement aimed a fighting immigration and the increasing power of the EU. His daughter has tried to present a softer image of the party as she tries to attract more supporters. She came second in France’s presidential election last year, although the party only has eight MPs. This compares to the party’s heyday under her father, in 1986, when it won 35 seats in Paris’s National Assembly. Mr Le Pen also came second to the conservative Jacques Chirac in the 2002 presidential election. But his daughter has herself been accused of inciting racial hatred, and discriminating against minority religious communities, particularly Jews and Muslims.

And if I was the Secretary of State for Defence, I would be very worried about what this 83-year-old great-great-grandmother is capable of.  After more than 20 years of struggle she got a widow\u0027s war pension after finding proof that her late husband Eric had been irradiated while flying sampling missions during Britain\u0027s nuclear tests.  Eric had piloted a converted Canberra bomber sniff plane through the mushroom cloud of our biggest hydrogen bomb when it was detonated over Christmas Island in the South Pacific. But when he got home he started to have crippling headaches. Shirley told me: One day he was holding his head with tears running down his face. He was in agony. We took him to psychiatrists but they had no idea what was wrong. Twice Shirley found and saved her husband as he tried to commit suicide. The third time, in 1976, he succeeded, slashing his wrists in a wood near their home.  Shirley was told by the MoD all of his medical records during his time at Christmas Island have disappeared. But then she discovered a radiation meter in his cockpit registered a dose of 13 Roentgen - the equivalent of 12,000 dental X-rays. Despite a series of legal hearings in which the MoD claimed Eric must have been mentally unstable because he used to wet the bed as a child, it was enough to win a war pension. But Shirley didn\u0027t stop. After the Freedom of Information Act was passed she applied for further details of Eric\u0027s service. In December 2007 they sent her a single sheet of paper which confirmed his dose of 13R, among the records of 13 other aircrew whose names and doses were blanked out. And three months after that, they sent extra documents as additional information. It contained a bombshell.  There, in black and white, it said: Thus the initial experiment was carried out on personnel flying the secondary sampler. Eric\u0027s plane, codenamed Sniff Two, was the second to enter the cloud. Eric had been subjected to an experiment.   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   At the time veterans were trying to sue the MoD for negligence. Shirley gave their lawyers the documents, but as they had more than a million papers to read it seems to have been lost. A little while ago she came across a copy and sent it on to me, because I\u0027ve been reporting on the veterans\u0027 story for the past 16 years. Like her, I\u0027ve seen a lot of these old documents. This one was about testing the film radiation badges thousands of the veterans were given during the tests, and comparing their readings to the Charlie meter which measured radiation in the cockpit. I read through it, and then I fell off my chair.   Experiment! Blimey! Three paragraphs later: Care was taken to ensure that as little shielding effect as possible was given by the ejector seat and that no equipment of any description shielded the badges. I flicked back. For the test a badge was put behind each crew member\u0027s head, on his two arm rests, and on his seat pan. So when they maximised radiation for the badges, they were maximising exposure of the men. His dose according to the badge in the centre of his chest was 13R, as we already knew. But at the bottom of the page was this:  The dose to his head was the biggest of all - almost 19R. Could it be linked to those headaches? And the specific dose to his testicles was 8.8R. You would need to work in a modern nuclear power station for about 460 years to get the same dose.  Eric has four generations of descendants. More than a third of them have an abnormality - including skull deformities, developmental problems, and extra and missing sets of teeth.  Eric knew he was flying through a mushroom cloud. He was likely aware of people testing these badges. But he wore no extra protection, and his widow is sure he was never told about a risk to his DNA. Shirley said: He never breathed a word about his missions to me, but if anyone had warned him about genetic damage he would never have let us have those children.  In February the chairman of the British Nuclear Test Veterans\u0027 Association, Alan Owen, told me four vets were returning to Christmas Island for the 60th anniversary of Grapple Y in April, and launching a medal campaign. Mirror editor Alison Philips agreed to back it, and when a friend introduced me to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson I asked him to do the same. As a former defence minister he knew of the issue, and had even tried to fix it by finding the scientific missing link the MoD had always demanded. It requires scientific method that, geneticists say, has yet to be discovered.  But Tom was only in the job six months. Now, as deputy, he has some responsibility to talk about medal-giving, so said he\u0027d throw his weight behind it. Veteran John Ward, 81, agreed to meet Tom in Parliament and talk to him about his experiences and his belief that they are to blame for his daughter Denise\u0027s extensive medical problems.   And then, with the greatest of pleasure, I rang the MoD. I\u0027ve rung them for comments a lot over the years. I usually have to explain to the press officer what nuclear veterans are before I explain the story. We\u0027ve got a document from 1958 which says personnel were used in a radiation experiment, I said. The only care taken was to ensure they weren\u0027t shielded, and the scientists knew about the possibility of genetic damage. We\u0027re running it tomorrow.  I emailed them the document. That was 9am on Tuesday morning. Over the course of the day the press office claimed the papers were just safety regulations, that it was an experiment on badges not men, and that policy documents say all kinds of stuff so it wasn\u0027t to be believed. I pointed out, repeatedly, a pilot\u0027s radiation exposure was maximised despite official awareness he might have genetic damage, and this was no blue-sky policy idea but a scientific endeavour that actually happened. An official comment landed in my inbox at 6pm. It said veterans were welcome to apply for compensation and added: At the time the military monitored the health of our service personnel and it is no surprise that selected quotes from historical documents refer to this.   1. The MoD has spent more than 30 years fighting every compensation and war pension claim brought by the veterans, at a cost to the public purse of more than \u0026pound17m 2. Monitoring their health? Really? The Mirror decided to hold the story until the next day, in the hope of a comment that actually addressed the story. At 9am, I rang the MoD again. I pointed out the word monitor did not appear in the document once, while the word experiment featured prominently. Off we went again. The press officer claimed this was evidence of keeping the men safe, and I pointed out Eric had zero protection while flying through a cloud produced by a bomb 100 times more powerful than that which levelled Hiroshima. The press officer went home, another started the evening shift, and a comment finally appeared at 8.30pm.  It said: It is not true to say that these men were subject to an experiment to look at the effects of radiation.   I didn\u0027t say it was. I said Eric was USED in an experiment involving radiation - like he was a Bunsen burner, rather than a man. I note you don\u0027t deny it.   The British nuclear testing programme contributed towards keeping our country secure during the Cold War and regular health checks were conducted throughout.  Where are the rest of Eric\u0027s records, then? You told Shirley you don\u0027t have any.      “The National Radiological Protection Board has carried out three studies of nuclear test veterans and found no valid evidence to link participation in this programme to ill health.”   There\u0027s plenty of circumstantial evidence: studies have found 1 in 3 veterans had bone cancer or leukaemia, 3 times the normal rate of miscarriage, 10 times the usual number of birth defects, and elevated rates of infant death. And in 2011 a survey by THE MOD ITSELF found 83% of veterans had up to 10 different health conditions. It\u0027s just the MoD considers this evidence invalid.    We published the story on our front page on Thursday. Tom Watson went on Sky News to demand the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson apologise to Shirley, and reveal how many other nuclear veterans were involved in experiments. I did interviews on LBC, British Forces radio and Forces TV.   These are some of the messages I have had since from veterans and their families: I had five sons after Christmas Island, they\u0027re all disabled my nephew died aged 7 from leukaemia and my sister has an illness doctors cannot diagnose my dad was at Grapple and I have extra teeth too. And these, about the Mirror\u0027s splash yesterday: About to go and buy the Mirror, I wish my dad could have seen this. And: The front page! I was crying as I took it out of the stand. Dad died in 1983, still a young man, never knew his grandchildren. Best of all, though, was a phone call from Shirley. Thank you, darling. You\u0027ve done Eric proud, and told his story so well, she said. Now, what can I do to help you next?  And that\u0027s the bit Gavin Williamson should worry about. What will we do next?

Under the plan, Northern Ireland could be given joint EU and UK status and a buffer zone on its border with the Republic. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake dismissed the plan as being like something out of Alice in Wonderland”. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign against a hard Brexit, said: If there was an award for coming up with unnecessarily complicated and convoluted solutions to self-inflicted problems, David Davis would win it every year.” Jeremy Corbyn already faces firm opposition from the centre-right of his party over Brexit, with a string of moderate MPs backing a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal.

The letter, organised by campaign group Best for Britain, was signed by a string of prominent Labour MPs including David Lammy, Tulip Siddiq, Wes Streeting, Mike Games and Neil Coyle. And the Labour leader (FRI) faces fresh pressure from the party’s left wing, as a prominent union leader urged him to “come clean with the electorate [and] say the Brexit squeeze ain’t worth the juice.” Manuel Cortes, boss of the transport union TSSA, warned Brexit would leave Labour’s working class supporters worse off.

The little boy died on July 28, aged 11 months and 24 days, after suffering a rare genetic disorder that caused progressive brain damage and muscle failure. His parents fought a High Court legal battle to have him transferred from Great Ormond Street Hospital to the US for treatment - which attracted huge public support - but lost.

We always said that if we could not help Charlie, then we would do our utmost to help other children in his name. This would be Charlie’s legacy. We obviously miss Charlie terribly. In his short time on this earth he brought us so much joy and happiness. And even though we can’t physically see him anymore, we strongly feel that he is with us every day and our memory of him continues to bring us the joy and happiness we received when he was here with us, although this is now heavily weighted with sadness.  It has been just over 10 months since Charlie grew his wings and departed from this earth. It has obviously been an incredibly tough 10 months without him but we have taken our grief, anger and sorrow and channeled it into making sure something good comes out of Charlie’s short life. Charlie would not have wanted us to wallow in grief or just give up. Charlie was put on this earth to make a difference, and boy did he do that. And we will carry on in his name to make that difference. Just a couple of hours before Charlie passed away, I laid on his bed, held his hand and had a little father/son chat with him. I told him many things. I told him how much he was loved, how much he would be missed and how proud we all were of him, amongst lots of other things.

Northern announced it was cancelling a staggering 165 trains over the next two months due to the chaos caused by a major timetable overhaul.  Over the past few weeks, Lynda, 52, says she has sent a 13 refund claims to Northern, three of which have been declined. In its latest reply, the under-fire operator offered her 1p following a delayed trip home from Manchester.   Lynda told the Manchester Evening News : I don’t claim for compensation unless the service has been cancelled, but this one I just thought was ridiculous.  “Is my time only worth one penny? There have been times where I have left work at half three and not got home until nearly 7pm. “If the journey is worth one pence, then maybe I should pay one penny for my journey. “On average, my journey is taking two hours each day. It is supposed to take just over an hour door to door.” There have been more than 2,000 Northern cancellations in the past week.

Martin Sampson, 41, of Brockenhurst, in the New Forest, Hampshire, said it was \u0027incredible\u0027 when a pregnant mother, along with six other donkeys, arrived on his drive. The pregnant donkey known as \u0027Jenny\u0027 went into labour outside his home and had given birth to her foal next to his car within 30 minutes.  After two hours of struggling, the foal took her first steps and left the driveway along with the rest of the group. Neighbours have said that another donkey was born in the very same spot 10 years ago and believe that it could be the same one that returned to give birth herself. Mr Sampson said: It was my five-year-old daughter Ellie who spotted what was happening at first. She noticed that the donkey was pregnant.  There were five or six other donkies that were hanging around ouside the driveway, as if they were checking it was a safe place to give birth. When we saw that she was going into labour we left some food outside for her for energy. She wasn\u0027t in any pain at all during the birth. After the birth some of the other donkeys began wailing very loudly. We think they were trying to warn off other animals that there had been a birth here.

Fans have been counting down the minutes and this series is expected to make an even bigger splash than last year. The finale on ITV2 was watched by 3.1 million people but, as this series takes place around the football World Cup, many more could check it out this time. It sounds like an unlikely TV smash, watching singletons looking for love in the sun while you sit in your PJs on the couch, but bosses are pouring money into it. “It is easily our number one show,” controller of ITV digital channels Paul Mortimer says, “so we are investing in it a bit more heavily.” With versions launched in other countries, and fans including Liam Gallagher and Stormzy, here’s what all the fuss is about...  Love Island starts with a 95-minute special at 9pm on Monday on ITV2.   The presenters Caroline Flack will welcome a new generation of islanders and speak to the evicted contestants packing their suitcases and heading home. But Caroline, below, flies in and out of the island throughout the series and arguably the biggest star of the show isn’t even seen on screen. Comedian Iain Stirling is the commentator – think the voice of Big Brother with sass and humour if you’ve not watched before – and he tells us what is going on in each episode with his tongue in his cheek. Iain only sees the footage for each episode at around 2pm and then has just a few hours to write a script filled with trademark gags – and then record it. He’s rightly become a huge star since he started to voice the show. “I’ve tried to see as little as possible,” he said, when asked what he thought of the line-up. “I try and watch as a viewer.”  How it works Every few days the islanders have to couple up, with those not in a couple at risk of being dumped from the island. But it is not just a case of 11 contestants going in and a winning couple at the end – that would be far too simple. Bosses say the path to true love is “littered with surprise bombshell arrivals” meaning by the end of the eight-week run there will have been more than 20 contestants. There will also be unexpected twists and turns like shock evictions, games, dates and bosses meddling. Most of this news is delivered to contestants via text message on one of their phones, often leading to screams of: “I’ve got a text!” And if two people fancy the same person? Bring on battles for affection and lots of gossiping in the garden.  Sex on TV Parents of contestants will want to look away and invest in ear plugs when their precious ones are doing the deed. While the footage of sex is not graphic – most couples go under a duvet - what you hear is often worse. Couples are also given the chance to spend a night in The Hideaway, a private bedroom where they can have some alone time... with the cameras still on. Bosses insist they don’t show anything graphic. “For the record, we don’t show sex on television” said ITV Studios MD Angela Jain. “We show the reaction to sex happening in the villa. “The way we cut it and treat it is part of a normal relationship. We don’t do it for any kind of salacious outcome.”  The contestants A total of 11 contestants will enter the show to begin with, all single and looking to mingle. They will then “couple up”, leaving one person the odd one out. The line-up includes a West End performer, personal trainer Adam Collard, model Hayley Hughes, an A\u0026ampE doctor and the daughter of EastEnders hardman Danny Dyer. The majority of the five women entering have had their hearts broken in the past 12 months and all of them hope they will finally find “the one” on the TV show where they have up to eight weeks to date. More than 100,000 people applied to go on the show this year but many of the contestants are offered up by agents or scouted from their social media profiles.  Bosses started with a “shortlist” of 1,000 and execs saw most of these themselves after casting agents narrowed it down. Love Island 2017 was won by Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay, although the couple split months after winning a \u0026pound50,000 prize. Kem and his co-star Chris Hughes, who came third with Olivia Attwood, went on to land a spin-off series and released a top 20 single, earning big money off the back of the success of last summer’s show.  The villa The villa is less than an hour’s drive from Palma airport in Majorca. It is the same one used last year. Camera runs in the garden are hidden in huts either side of an infinity pool and LEDs which can change colour are all around the garden floor. Executive producer Tom Gould said: “The sun deck is different and has changed in a new re-imagined space and there is a swing seat. “It makes it more attractive for them and it’s better for us to film. The hideaway has had its annual makeover. And the bedroom. “There is an inside-out theme, too. We have grass on the walls inside. And that new design has been picked up in the bedroom and lounge, to tie the whole thing as one. “On the walls and by the beds there are phrases and stuff that have been said before like ‘You OK, Hun?’ and now have a life of their own...” A smoking area has also had to be created after there were complaints last year.  Paul Mortimer says: “Because they’re a very sexy cast in a  sexy environment on a sexy channel then it made smoking look glamorous.  “Ofcom took a view that it was unacceptable. It’s not against the law to smoke cigarettes but this year we have in plan a place for the smoking area to be outside the villa rather than inside.”   The lingo  The show is well known for introducing a range of words into the nation’s vocabulary, including...  Grafting Focusing your attention on the boy/girl you want and working to woo them.   Muggy If you are doing something bad or disrespectful.   Melt Acting soppy.   Pied off When you are shot down or basically rejected.   Stick it on Make a move on a boy/girl.   My type on paper A perfect match.

A couple ran the private members\u0027 sex club where punters had to always be naked apart from flip-flops. They have been ordered to hand over more than \u0026pound45,000 as a result of continuing to operate the dungeon despite orders to close it down. Directors of the Kestrel Hydro Spa in green-belt Stanwell Moor, Surrey, Graham Tattershall and Ann Trewren, stood in the dock at Guildford Crown Court yesterday. They had lost numerous appeals against a council enforcement order which said the sex dungeon was inappropriate to the area. The nudist colony was run for more than 10 years and featured a swimming pool, a sauna, a sex dungeon.  Tattershall and Trewen were ordered to pay back \u0026pound22,500 each and were also told they will be sentenced for ignoring the council enforcement orders at a future date. Tattershall, aged 65 years, was director of the spa and 54-year-old Trewen was his business partner. The spa ran into legal issues when Spelthorne Borough Council received complaints from neighbours about the previously domestic property being used as a sex club. The council maintained that due to the green-belt location of the club and the lack of a licence to be used as an adult members club, all structures put up should be removed and trading should stop. Tattershall embarked on a three year legal battle and the case was heard all the way up to the Court of Appeal in London, but in 2016 he was told he had to dismantle the outbuildings and hard-standings and stop using the sordid use of the land. However the pair continued to run the club despite being given a year to cease operations and were ordered to pay back the money they had made in this time at a hearing at Guildford Crown Court.

Stewart Kelly\u0027s heartbroken family have insisted he could have been saved if he’d got access to the drug earlier.  His condition had reached the critical stage when a drug company provided a new unlicensed drug for free, the Daily Record reports.  But it took two months to go through a special health board committee for unlicensed drugs before Symdeko could be prescribed. In that time Stewart’s lung function had dropped to a perilously low 11 per cent - and the drug came too late to save his life. Despite a brave battle, Stewart, from Paisley, died on Wednesday. His family have begged the Scottish government to make Symdeko available to other CF sufferers.  His heartbroken auntie Margaret Beveridge said: “He started his recovery but it was just too late. We had hoped, because he was such a fighter, that he would live long enough for the third generation of the drugs to arrive.” Calling on the drug to be made available quickly to other sufferers, Margaret said: “There are other patients who could still benefit from this drug.” Drug company Vertex offered Symdeko to Stewart and five other cystic fibrosis patients last October. Stewart was finally allowed to have the drug in December by his local health board. The other five people offered the drug were refused - and one of them has now also died. Margaret spoke out about Stewart’s death in an effort to persuade the Scottish Government to seek an agreement with Vertex to provide drugs like Orkambi, Symdeko and a new generation of drugs which will soon be available to save people like her much loved nephew. On Monday the Daily Record told how a cystic fibrosis consultant was watching another young man die because he was unable to give him the drug Orkambi - a medication which halts the progression of the disease - despite Vertex providing it free on compassionate grounds.  Professor Gordon MacGregor is desperate to prescribe Orkambi but the Scottish Medicines Consortium, which advises the NHS on which drugs it should prescribe, have rejected it because of the cost.   And even though the drug firm has offered to provide it free, the patient’s health board has not allowed it to be prescribed. Unless they approve it the young man will die. CF campaigners are trying to persuade the Scottish Government to negotiate with Vertex on the entire portfolio of their CF drugs - including those yet to come on the market. Those negotiations are already under way in England and Wales. Margaret, 65, from Kilmaurs, Ayrshire said: “Stewart was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis the minute he was born. “For the last 10 years I have been in touch with Vertex and two years ago they provided Orkambi free on compassionate grounds but Stewart couldn’t tolerate it. “I kept in touch with them and in October they offered Symdeko to Stewart and five other patients. But he had to wait until December to get it and in those two months Stewart had deteriorated so much. We knew he couldn’t survive long term. “His weight dropped to 100lb and his lung function went down to 11 per cent. It was just awful. He was in so much pain and he couldn’t breathe. He was on morphine during the night and was on oxygen constantly.”  When Stewart was finally given Symdeko he did begin to improve, but the damage to his lungs was so great he did not survive. Margaret, who works in the pharmaceutical industry, explained: “Stewart couldn’t breathe because the mucus was so thick and sticky he couldn’t release it at all. It was like thick glue. Even with intensive physiotherapy he couldn’t breathe but the first thing Symdeko did was enable him to spit the mucus up and once he started clearing his lungs the antibiotics could get in and work.” Remarkably his lung function improved marginally to 14 per cent. CF patients lose an average of one to two per cent lung function every year. Margaret admitted she thinks Stewart alone got Symdeko because “they knew I wouldn’t go away”.  But she said: “There are another four patients who could still benefit.” Margaret continued: “Orkambi is the first generation of these new drugs and will hold them stable but there can be side effects. Symdeko is a second generation drug. Incredibly Stewart was still walking around after he got it. It can give back some lung function. “But there is a triple combination, a third generation drug, coming in a few months and that is a life changer. “People with cystic fibrosis will be able to live a normal life. “Two of Stewart’s friends died last year. Their doctors didn’t even tell them about Orkambi or Symdeko. They had no hope that something was coming.”  Now all Stewart’s family can do is grieve for him and speak out to prevent this horrible disease taking someone else’s son or daughter unnecessarily. On Sunday, May 20 Celtic-daft Stewart was well enough to attend Scott Brown’s testimonial match at Celtic Park. Margaret said: “He had such a good time and met people like comedian Kevin Bridges and Lisbon Lion Bertie Auld as well as some of the current team. He got selfies taken with them. “He had to take his oxygen with him but he took it out briefly to have his photos taken. He didn’t want to be seen as a sick person.” But just a week later he was admitted once more to hospital. Margaret said: “He had a beautiful girlfriend Dionne Pearson. She spoke to him four or five times a day. On Tuesday she celebrated her 22nd birthday with him at the hospital. He died the next day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"london bridge hero pc who","story":"NewsLondon Bridge hero PC stabbed while tackling knife-wielding terrorists set to return to duty one year after attackBrave Wayne Marques, who was ­seriously injured as he battled the jihadis can now walk again unaided\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy-Clare Martin22:38, 1 JUN 2018Updated23:13, 1 JUN 2018NewsBritish Transport Police of Wayne Marques fought off terrorists with only his baton (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hero policeman who tackled knife-wielding terrorists with just his baton is set to return to duty.

And the organ had moved so far out of place Anna Curtis could feel it in the shower. Gym bunny Anna worked out throughout her pregnancy with daughter Lauren, now four, but after giving birth, she began leaking” every time she exercised. It made her job as a post-natal personal trainer nigh on impossible. At first, Anna, of Epsom, Surrey, thought her body was simply recovering from childbirth. The 39-year-old said: After my first gym class following Lauren’s birth, I leaked a little but thought it was just part and parcel of what my body had been through. “But it continued until the point where it wasn’t just when I exercised. At times, I’d be left very distressed when I leaked through my clothes.  When her symptoms worsened over the course of 18 months, she eventually discovered that her bladder had prolapsed – when one or more of the organs in the pelvis slip out of place. “I’d known all along that was the case, she said of the prolapse diagnosis. I had this awful feeling of heaviness and I could literally feel it in the shower.” During her textbook pregnancy with Lauren, Anna, whose husband, Michael Curtis, 42, is a network engineer, even continued to run and lift weights “right up to the birth.” Then, after delivering Lauren naturally at Epsom General Hospital in July 2013, she began experiencing an odd heavy feeling in the pit of her stomach. Initially, she thought it was just her body recovering, but then, eight weeks later, she went to a mother and baby fitness class, only for her bladder to leak afterwards.  “At the time, I wasn’t a post-natal personal trainer, so I didn’t know the dos and don’t of exercising after childbirth,” said Anna. “I’ve always been very fit, so I threw myself into it. “I almost felt I had something to prove. “For many women, the pressure to bounce back, lose that baby weight and be back in your size eight jeans comes from magazines and celebrities, but in my case, it came from within. “Fitness has always been a passion of mine. I enjoy it. It reduces stress and it’s my way of being there for myself.” Cautious, Anna consulted her GP for advice, but said she did not get many answers at first. She added: “Everyone thought it was just my body recovering, so I felt like I had to get on with things.” When Lauren was five months old, Anna started leading fitness classes. The exercise itself was no problem but, working out most days, her urinary incontinence worsened to the point where she struggled to teach. She had to wear pads almost around the clock – even then having accidents, when urine would leak through her clothes. For 18 long months, she was left feeling “upset and embarrassed” about her problem.  Then a urologist, diagnosed her prolapse which, according to the NHS, happens when one or more of the organs in the pelvis slip from their normal position and bulge into the vagina. While not life-threatening, it can be incredibly uncomfortable, and symptoms include a feeling of heaviness in the tummy, feeling or seeing a lump or bulge, problems with weeing and discomfort during sex. On top of this, Anna also has diastasis - where the two muscles running down the middle of her stomach separated – meaning she still looked pregnant months after giving birth. Thankfully, both conditions improved after she began working with pelvic floor physiotherapist Emma Brockwell, having sessions once a month. “The prolapse is something I’ll have to stay on top of my whole life, but the physio has helped enormously,” said Anna, whose experiences have inspired her to start mother baby fitness classes called Team Mama. “In lots of countries, women are given pelvic floor physio as standard after giving birth, but here, I felt I had to really fight for it.” Though her prolapse has remained stable and urinary incontinence has improved, Anna’s diastasis sadly worsened when she gave birth to her second child, Mattie, in August 2017. Admitting that she had been nervous about getting pregnant again, she continued: “Everything had come together quite well, thanks to the physio, then after Mattie it came back hugely.

A 20-year-old woman is in a critical condition today when the crash occurred as crowds gathered to watch a \u0027car meet\u0027, police confirmed. A witness claims more than 100 people were on the pavement watching cars ‘drift’ around the roundabout – known in as ‘Magic Roundabout’ - in Trafford Park when a vehicle careered into them. A 23-year-old man was taken to hospital with \u0027minor\u0027 injuries and has since been released. A man has been arrested following the crash, on Europa Way at around 9.50pm on Thursday night.  The driver failed to stop, police said. A blue BMW 330D believed to have been involved in the collision was later found in neighbouring Salford. This morning a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a collision. This afternoon, a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.  North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said those injured were in their 20s and 30s and they were taken to Salford Royal Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary. Car meets are often held at Trafford Park. Jamie Brown, 23, was standing nearby when the crash happened and ran to help those injured. Jamie, from Radcliffe told the Manchester Evening News: “There was well over 100 people there, probably about five to 10 cars taking part. “People were drifting around the roundabout.  “I was stood where the crash happened literally about a minute before, then my mate said let’s go back to the car and go. “As we got to the car I heard a huge bang and turned around and saw what had happened. “People were screaming, it was chaotic. I ran over to see what was going on. It was horrific.” There is no evidence to suggest that this is terrorism related at this stage. GMP’s Chief Superintendent Wayne Miller, said: “The men we arrested remain in custody and we continue to question them as part of our investigation.

With all of the headlines about food banks and obesity, we are preparing our students for healthy lifestyles in the future.

He wore Rolex watches, drove a Ferrari with ‘diplomatic’ plates and owned a two-bedroom home on the upmarket millionaire\u0027s haven at Fisher Island on Biscayne Bay. He appeared to have powerful business connections and more than half a billion dollars in the bank. All of it was a lie. Prince Kalid, real name Anthony Gignac, faces spending years of his life behind bars after admitting impersonating a foreign government official, identity theft and fraud. It was all part of an elaborate scam which saw Gignac, 47, and accomplices dupe 26 victims across the world out of at least $8million over the last two years.  He falsely told others that he had diplomatic immunity and was required to check in with the U.S. Department of State every few hours, according passed from the U.S. attorney\u0027s office to the Miami Herald. Gignac was given gifts, including expensive paintings and jewelry, based on his false representations.  Prince Kalid was just one of many aliases used by Kalid to convince investors to cash in on his fraudulent business deals. Born in Colombia, the former street child lived in the US since the early 1990s.\u2028\u2028He was arrested in November when attempting to fly from London to New York while using a fake passport with another name, according to reports.  \u2028Investigators acquired a search warrant to Gignac’s condo, which reportedly had a ‘sultan’ nameplate on the front door. Inside they found a cache of different business cards with Gignac’s various idenities and self given titles, including ‘His Royal Highness’. Fake diplomatic licence plates, a security badge, illegal credit cards and thousands of dollars in cash were also discovered, as were financial documents with the name of a member of the royal family. \u2028\u2028 In 2015 Gignac and partners created a fake investment company called Marden Williams International. They falsely claimed to be able to facilitate exclusive business investments with the Saudi Royal Family.  One investor paid $5 million to the company. \u2028In 2017, Gignac pretended to be a member of the Saudi Royal Family - reportedly with a $600 million fortune in a J.P Morgan account. He stayed at the hotel usinga credit card in the name of a member of the royal family. During the visit he drove a Ferrari with diplomatic license plates. According to the herald an accomplice, Carl Williamson, who assisted Gignac in his scams was also charged. He died in March.

But aside from the surreal sight of a North Korean official in the Oval Office to hand it over, the first thing everyone noticed is just how huge it is. The oversized envelope is the sort of thing you\u0027d sooner expect to see at the presentation of a giant fundraising cheque for charity. Both sides obviously relished the photo opportunity, but social media is speculating there may be another reason the letter was so big. One of the most common playground insults levelled at the US president is that his hands are small.    Some online wags are claiming this is why the letter was so large, so that the North Korean leader could enjoy a dig at his North American rival. A little far fetched perhaps, until you remember the insults the two were throwing at each other just a few months ago - from \u0027my nuclear button is bigger than yours\u0027 to \u0027dotards\u0027.   And if that wasn\u0027t bizarre enough, there was the classic Trump moment where he tells reporters the letter was \u0027very nice\u0027 - before immediately admitting he hadn\u0027t actually read it. The White House later stated Trump had in fact bothered to read what is arguably one of the most politically significant pieces of correspondence the presidency has seen in living memory. The letter was handed over during a meeting between the Republican leader and North Korea\u0027s former intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol. Afterwards they exchanged smiles and handshakes, patting his arm in a friendly gesture.  Good meeting today. I think it\u0027s a great start, Trump said after conferring for about 90 minutes with Kim. He is the first North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years and who the president called the second most powerful man in North Korea. Trump said he expected an eventual very positive result with North Korea but dampened expectations for a breakthrough in Singapore. We\u0027re not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were, Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. We\u0027re going to start a process. And I told them today, \u0027Take your time, we can go fast, we can go slowly,\u0027 but I think they\u0027d like to see something happen.  Trump said it could take several meetings to reach an agreement, but he was convinced that Kim Jong Un was committed to denuclearization. He\u0027d like to see it happen, Trump said. We\u0027re getting along, so it\u0027s not a question of maximum pressure, Trump said. At some point, hopefully ... for the good of millions of people, a deal will be worked out. Trump said one thing that could come out of the summit is an agreement formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War, which was concluded only with a truce, not a peace treaty.

The 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO - the Holy Grail model - won the Tour de France Automobile in 1964, which is one of the world’s most famous and historic motor races. It is a 174mph road-legal racing car and one of only 36 built between 1962 and 1964. For years the Ferrari has been based in Germany but shown and driven at events around the world. The Ferrari, known as 4153 GT, has now been sold for $70 million - a record-breaking figure for a car.  Leading Ferrari historian Marcel Massini, who described the car as one of the top three or four GTOs in the world, confirmed it had been bought by an American businessman. Mr Massini added he was confident a GTO would be sold for $100 million within five years. During the 1990s, the GTO was restored by Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering. The bluechip car specialist wasn\u0027t involved in the \u0026pound52 million deal. But James Cottingham, vehicle acquisition specialist at DK Engineering, said: This is without doubt one of the best 250 GTOs in existence in terms of history and originality. Its period competition is very good. It won the Tour de France which is big tick and was fourth overall at Le Mans which was a mega result. It was raced by Ecurie Francorchamps, who are one of the most iconic and famous independent Ferrari teams, it has never had a big accident and it is highly original.

The snaps are of just one of the leader\u0027s homes, which is perhaps not as lavish or palatial as you might expect. The images were reportedly taken by a photographer who joined Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on a trip to the nation yesterday. They show large, well maintained gardens and a black Mercedes parked in the driveway.  The property itself appears to be two storey, with floor to ceiling glass windows at the front and a minimalist design that suits a communist state. The photographs have been released just as there are renewed hopes for the much anticipated Trump-Kim summit. Today, in a complete reversal, the US president said he would go ahead with the meeting on June 12 in Singapore.  Eight days after canceling the unprecedented summit, citing Pyongyang\u0027s open hostility, Trump welcomed North Korea\u0027s former intelligence chief to the White House Oval Office. Afterwards he exchanged smiles and handshakes, patting his arm in a friendly gesture. Good meeting today. I think it\u0027s a great start, Trump said after conferring for about 90 minutes with Kim Yong Chol, who became the first North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years and who the US president called the second powerful man in North Korea.  Trump said he expected an eventual very positive result with North Korea but dampened expectations for a breakthrough in Singapore. We\u0027re not going to go in and sign something on June 12, and we never were, Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. We\u0027re going to start a process. And I told them today, \u0027Take your time, we can go fast, we can go slowly,\u0027 but I think they\u0027d like to see something happen.

CCTV footage shows the gang taking Nong Gift, 21, out of the bar where she had been watching the Champions League final with friends last Saturday in Chanthaburi, Thailand. The cosmetics seller passed out inside the pub - with relatives claiming she had been drugged - and was carried out at 2am and put in the back of a pick-up truck by four men who it\u0027s said claimed they would take her home. But the men - including one who is said to have known her - drove her to a secluded orchard where she was \u0027repeatedly raped\u0027 before being beaten to death.  The gang - Nattaphong Saenkraud, 24, Patti Boonthal, 23, Panya Chan Somdee, 18, and Surasit Jaechim, 24 - are reported to have confessed their involvement to police. On Wednesday they were taken on a crime re-enactment. CCTV shows them - with the help of a female friend of Nong who is said to be the one who thought the group would take her home - carrying her out of the Orbit Pub and putting her into the back of a truck. Police Major General Charn Jitjunjun said: The victim was found dead on the same night. Four men have been arrested and confessed to their part in the crime. The victim was raped by four people and we believe beaten until she died. Her body was found with foam around her mouth, a nose bleed and part of her clothes on the floor.\u0027  A devastated friend who had been with Nong earlier in the evening said she had left her with the group of men because she thought they were her friends. There were also women in the group when she left including the woman who helped to carry Nong into the truck. Airziz Opachat, who left at 1.40am some 30 minutes before her friend passed out, said: I\u0027m sorry. If we knew that last night was the last time we were together. I will take care of you better. I\u0027m sorry I did not take care of you better. Nong had been with three other women while watching the football match but only knew one of them, Airziz Opachat, well, according to local media. They had been on holiday together in the past and socialised regularly, it was reported. The other girls all left earlier in the evening and Airziz said that Nong didn\u0027t seem very drunk. She added: Nong already knew one of the men. She was friendly with everyone. It was normal for her to be out chatting with people.  I thought that she had arrived with these men and was friends with them. Between us we had all drank about half a bottle of whiskey. I woke up in the morning and didn\u0027t see any message from Nong. The only message was from a man that said \u0027your friend is dead\u0027. Nong\u0027s body was found in the fruit processing area. The four men were arrested later on Sunday, May 27, afternoon after police viewed CCTV and tracked them down. During the crime re-enactment the four men were taken to the bar, shown loading a woman into their truck and taken to warehouse at the orchard where the attack happened. One of the group, Surasit Jaechim, the man who knew her, claims he only drove her and the other men to the area where she was killed. All men have been held in custody. Police are now carrying out post mortem examinations on Nong\u0027s body to discover whether she was drugged and the exact cause of her death.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad. He is a defender who likes to get up the park and helps create attacking situations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee council wants to remove hidden factors stopping folk exercising","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil chiefs want to encourage even the most unfit Dundonians to get more active – in a bid to tackle loneliness and isolation.The Scottish Government plans to create a national strategy designed to tackle the issue.It launched a consultation asking various organisations for their views on how to reduce the number of people who feel cut off from others in their communities.City council bosses say they’ve already set up several initiatives across the city, designed to have an impact on social isolation and loneliness.Now they want to get rid of the various “hidden factors” they say are preventing certain groups of people from taking part in physical activity – which plays a crucial role in helping people feel more involved and build greater relationships.Peter Allan, the council’s community planning manager, said it was important to tackle the potential for someone to become isolated at an early age.In a report submitted to the Scottish Government, Mr Allan said: “Physical activity needs to be promoted as accessible, achievable and beneficial for everyone, not as something that only fit and able people can do.“It needs to be non-stigmatising and involve minimal special equipment/clothing.“Walking groups are a great way of getting people active in a social way.“Experience in Dundee has demonstrated possible hidden factors limiting participation in physical activity including transportation, equipment and broader cultural factors.”Mr Allan added: “We need increased resources and focus within early years education, health visiting, social work and schools.“Perhaps a simple needs assessment tool could be developed to investigate where social isolation might be an issue. This should recognise that isolation can be caused or exacerbated by poverty and measures should be in place to support people on a low income to participate fully in society.“It would be helpful to equip staff, who engage with the public across a wide range of services, with the training and information to enable them to help identify people who may benefit from support.”The government will consider the responses before publishing its strategy.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man struggled with his partner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKriss McCann, 36, of Farington Terrace, had sentence

nominated as Nail Technician of the Year at the Scottish Beauty Industry awards which will be announced on June 17.It all started nine years ago when Jennifer undertook a nail technician diploma in Glasgow.Jennifer said: “Beauty was something I was always into and after completing my diploma I did nails part time.“About five years ago I started my own business at home then started renting spaces in salons.”In 2016 Jennifer was diagnosed with breast cancer but still carried on creating her nail masterpieces from her home when she felt well enough.Thankfully in June 2017 Jennifer was given the all clear and was determined to get back into the beauty industry.“My friend used to have her salon in premises in Blackness Road and when she outgrew the space she told me to take over the lease,” she said.“I decided to go for it and I opened the salon a few weeks ago with an amazing team behind me.“Having been unwell for such a long time I wanted to get back into work and it gave me the push to just go for it.“My current team are Brooke Garside, Helena Turner, Victoria Davie and Nicky McLeish.“They are all amazing.“It has been difficult but it looks amazing now and we are offering a wide

come into the beauty industry.“It will help so many people create careers especially as the beauty industry is so big right now and hopefully I can help put people into employment.“I can’t wait to

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b111dfa0d8de.jpg ","title":"playpark becomes first in dundee to go smoke free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA playpark in Stobswell has become the designated first smoke-free play area in the city.New signs designed by Glebelands Primary School pupil Weronika Soltys have been unveiled at the playground in Baxter Park.The signs will now be placed across parks throughout the city, restricting smokers from lighting up in play areas.Anne Rendall, neighbourhood services depute convener, said: “By introducing smoke-free playparks in Dundee, we are able to create children’s play areas that are cleaner as there is less chance of cigarette ends being discarded.“I believe these voluntary smoke-free zones will help improve people’s health across the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

Thailand is fantastic and the people are extremely friendly – you can get out there for 10 nights, staying in a three-star hotel, for £699.“You would often be more expensive holidaying in Europe.”Colin said the company had also seen a rise in people going on multiple “city break” holidays throughout the year.He said: “Popular destinations are Krakow, Prague and Budapest.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af955efd6057-e1526306704386.jpg ","title":"summer concerts return to dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA summer concert series is returning to Verdant Works.Music in the Mill, the fortnightly lunchtime series, will feature a host of artists throughout this summer.Concerts take place in the High Mill, the award-winning space which forms part of the spectacular converted jute mill.Gill Poulter, heritage and exhibitions director at Dundee Heritage Trust, said: “Our Music in the Mill series is highly popular, so we’re delighted to see it return.“Between our concerts, workshops and the other summer activities we have lined up, it’s safe to say Verdant Works is much more than just a social history museum.

It will also look at the introduction of some of its funniest and most famous characters – Dennis and Gnasher, Rodger the Dodger, Minnie the Minx and, of course, The Bash Street Kids.Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios, said: “The exhibition is amazingly detailed.“It means that real hardcore fans of the Beano and Bash Street Kids are likely to come more than once.“To me, it’s like reading the Beano – you read it the first time then go back and see a wee joke here or there that you maybe missed.“Those wee nuggets will be picked up the more detailed your visit to The McManus is.“The exhibition includes things from the archive that haven’t been seen for years, from the very first issues of the comic right up to the CGI from the Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed series from CBBC – so it’s really unique.”The Bash Street Kids, Beanotown’s most rowdy pupils, have featured in the publication since the 1950s.Mike said: “The Bash Street Kids strip started out life as ‘When the Bell Rings’ in 1954, and that was because the editor at the time encouraged staff to look out the window when the bell was rung at the High School of Dundee for inspiration for the zany antics of the children in the playground.“What the kids were doing ended up in the strip quite regularly and helped the design of the characters.“In 1956 they became the Bash Street Kids and began to focus on the group of kids in Class 2B that we still see today.“Since 1961, David Sutherland has drawn the strip. He ‘retired’ in 1998 but continues to draw it. He’s one of the few artists who still hand in a hard copy of their work – a true legend.“You can imagine how much of his work is included in the exhibition. We will be showing a special movie in which he stars, showing the strip being put together.“I think The McManus is the only place in the world suitable for this because the cartoons are really Dundonian in nature.“Many a time there has been someone walking up Reform Street who has been the inspiration for a character or scene in the Beano, so The McManus really is the only place to showcase this.“For 80 years the Beano has been regularly enjoyed by 27 million people in the UK, so there will be things that appeal to grand-parents and grandchildren, their own memories of the comic over the years as it has evolved.”Meanwhile, illustrator Nigel Parkinson has created an original comic strip starring The Bash Street Kids designing the new sign for The McMenace.The illustration shows them tangled in the “Waldella, Dundee” by artist David Batchelor, which is one of museum’s most popular exhibits.The exhibition runs until Sunday October 21 and entry is free of charge.For further information, visit beano.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Brendan Rodgers  Celtic remain miles away from European elite","story":"                          BRENDAN RODGERS has admitted Celtic are still some distance away from properly competing in the Champions League."},{"url":null,"title":"Times Past gallery of the week  Glasgow theatres","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7216887.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Dave King  SPFL board members weren t told about potential conflict of interest between Murdoch MacLennan and Celtic","story":"                          DAVE KING has hit back at the SPFL and insisted they would \u0026lsquowelcome\u0026rsquo an independent review if they had \u0026lsquobehaved properly\u0026rsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"25 years of Real Love  The Time Frequency founder Jon Campbell reveals the key to the band s success","story":"                          IT\u0026rsquoS the early 90s and East End songwriter Jon Campbell is sitting in his Dennistoun flat compiling the words to Real Love."},{"url":null,"title":" Seeing Peru party has made me determined to help Scotland reach the World Cup ","story":"                          THEY came in their tens of thousands hours before kick-off all decked out in the iconic white and red strips of their country."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7151092.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Radical council plan to give residents control over budget spending","story":"                          Communities in Glasgow will get control of \u0026pound1m of council cash in a pilot scheme to give people more control over decisions."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7866672.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Can you help  Scotland  39 s top dance school needs a new home","story":"                          SCOTLAND\u0027S dance school is desperately seeking a new home with the closure of the Citizen\u0027s Theatre."},{"url":null,"title":"The bare chest is back  Aidan Turner shirtless again in new Poldark","story":"                          AIDAN Turner will cause a stir among viewers when he returns for another series of Poldark \u0026ndash without his shirt on."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7867533.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Lily Allen to bring UK tour to Glasgow -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential. With the future of the British High Street in decline at the moment, we need to look at as many options to make it viable for all business and attract new brands into the city centre.\"Saturday 2 Jun 2018 1:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

river","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe wraps have come off the major artwork that is destined to be the centrepiece of the River Ness Public Art Project.The new design involves both sides of the river at the Little Isle salmon pool near Ness Islands.This latest so-called Gathering Place is entitled My Ness, and has been drawn up by the artists who designed the highly controversial previous concept which was dubbed the \"tilting pier\", which was earmarked for a site closer to Eden Court \u0026ndash it was eventually ditched in the face of huge public opposition.The new project is less \"in your face\" and involves a wall starting very low at the Fisherman\u0027 Hut beside Bught Park then rising as it sweeps round until it ends with a viewing platform over the water.The curved wall is repeated on a smaller scale on the Island Bank Road side of the water, the aim being to form two sides of an amphitheatre, embracing the river.Canadian artist Tristan Surtees of Sans fa\u0026ccedilon art company, thought the new design would be embraced by the public.He said: \"We took a different approach this time, and I am confident it is in the right place compared with the tilting pier.\"I think the river is iconic, and this is about framing the river. I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

However, after playing the first game I was hungry for more and I want to cement a place now.“I have had a taste of it and it is now up to me to keep improving, developing and giving the manager a decision to make.”Such was the faith McLeish had in the Pittodrie centre-back he was handed a start on his debut in the 1-0 friendly loss to Costa Rica in March.McKenna impressed so much he retained that spot for the 1-0 defeat of Hungary in Budapest a few days later. The young Don produced a man of the match performance.Although still a relative Scotland rookie, McKenna was the second most experienced international in a starting defence in the 2-0 loss in Peru which included debut caps Jordan Archer, Stephen O’Donnell and Lewis Stevenson.Only captain Charlie Mulgrew, winning his 35th cap, had more experience.For McKenna, working under Pittodrie defensive legend McLeish has been invaluable in his career development.The Gothenburg Great’s advice? Play for Scotland the way he does for Aberdeen.McKenna said: “He (McLeish) has been brilliant for me, especially in training.“In the first camp he was giving me wee bits of advice and in this camp he showed me a video clip from it.“It wasn’t a mistake or anything, it was simply a back pass. He asked me why I did it and I said it had been my first game and I was being safe.“He said, ‘don’t be, do what you do at your club’ and has been telling me to be positive. He has that belief in me which is encouraging.”Aberdeen skipper Graeme Shinnie is set to earn his second cap in Mexico City having made his debut as a substitute against Peru.Scotland jetted out to Mexico last night as they had opted to remain in Lima, Peru, to train as the conditions were more favourable there.The temperature is set to be in the high 20s at the Azteca with the added difficulty of altitude at 7,200 feet above sea level.Both Mexico and Peru are using the Scots as part of their World Cup preparations.Yet again Scotland have failed to qualify. It is now two decades since the Scots last graced the finals of a major tournament, at the World Cup in France in 1998.McKenna is desperate for that barren run to end.He said: “We have to get Scotland to that place where everyone is at Hampden having a party before we go off to a major tournament.“It is something we want to do. The sheer love of football out in Peru is incredible“You could see how much it means to them to be going to the World Cup.“We went out to the coffee shops across from the hotel earlier in the week and were mobbed for photos.“People were stopping their cars to take photos of the bus on the way to training, it was incredible. The atmosphere was like that the whole week.”Along with Aberdeen skipper Shinnie, 26, another six players made their debuts against Peru – Archer, O’Donnell, Stevenson, Dylan McGeouch, Lewis Morgan and Chris Cadden.McKenna conceded a penalty in the 36th minute in Lima when he blocked a Jefferson Farfan shot following a mistake from keeper Archer.There was no culpability in the incident with McKenna who at least denied Farfan a certain goal.The resultant spot-kick was converted by Christian Cueva, with Farfan scoring the second early in the second-half in front of a sell-out crowd of 47,000.McKenna and Shinnie are set to grace the stadium that hosted the 1970 World Cup final where Brazil defeated Italy 4-1. It is also the venue where Diego Maradona scored a sublime solo goal in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final win over England.McKenna said: “The atmosphere was incredible and the Azteca is double the capacity from the Estadio Nacional.“It is their last game before they go to the World Cup so it will be even better. It is something all the boys have to look forward to and enjoy.“A positive result would be good but as it is a young squad it is important that we put on a good performance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached.
