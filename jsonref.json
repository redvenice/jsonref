It\u0027s because of the inability of many people in those places to self-isolate and this is a real gap in our defences and we\u0027re leaving poorer communities exposed to this virus if we don\u0027t fix this.\u0027  Sir Richard said: \u0027There is no evidence to support at the moment that additional lockdown measures would improve the chances of reducing the number of cases.\u0027He added that officials in Oldham had \u0027really upped\u0027 test and trace at a local level - rather than relying on the Government system - and were now carrying out around 1,000 tests a day.The vast majority of those testing positive for coronavirus in Greater Manchester overall were either asymptomatic or had barely any symptoms, he said.For the week ending August 8, the infection rate for Greater Manchester as a whole is 35.3 - up from 28.6 the week before.  But Sir Richard said Oldham is the only part of Greater Manchester that has a \u0027red rating\u0027 for its numbers of cases, suggesting it must be seen as separate to the rest of the area.  He added that infection rates had dropped in Salford, Trafford and Wigan.  Despite this, Sir Richard and Mr Burnham said they had written to Mr Hancock not to allow the reopening of businesses such as casinos and ice rinks, which had been due to take place this weekend, in Greater Manchester. Mr Burnham said: \u0027The first thing that we\u0027ve said to the Health Secretary is that we don\u0027t believe that it would be right to see the further relaxation with regard to the opening of a range of additional business premises this weekend or in the near future.\u0027The mayor said there would be targeted enforcement against pubs, restaurants and supermarkets not following guidance.He said the pub industry needed \u0027to get more serious\u0027 by capturing people\u0027s names and addresses of customers so the test and trace system works. It comes just two days after an undercover investigation by Sky News discovered nine out of ten venues in Greater Manchester were not following guidance.  An undercover team visited a variety of hospitality venues in one suburb, posing as walk-in customers, finding most did not ask the customers for their details to support the NHS track and trace system. Mr Burnham warned last week that pubs in Greater Manchester will need to close if the contact tracing system was not improved.According to the BBC, he said: \u0027There is a growing amount of evidence that pubs are one of the main places where this virus spreads.\u0027 Mr Burnham also said last night he would be writing to the major supermarkets to call for a stricter approach to enforcing the wearing of face coverings in stores.  Coronavirus: Undercover team finds pubs and bars ignoring COVID-19 guidance in area where cases are rising | UK News | Sky NewsAndy Burnham calling on government not to send Oldham into full lockdown -

Artist Sophie Cundale packs more into a half-hour film than seems possible, let alone advisable. The Near Room, which takes its title from the mental space Muhammad Ali said he entered during his fights, opened at the South London Gallery back in March then promptly closed. The gallery reopens on Saturday allowing the film to continue its run. And what a run it is. There is much to admire in Cundale’s film, which is crammed with ideas, from a briskly choreographed training session at a local boxing gym to the homoerotic tenderness of the fight itself, from the rigours and self-punishment of a boxer’s diet regime to the lights-out catastrophe of the knockout punch – and all that in the first five minutes.While professional south London boxer John Harding Jr lies prone on the mat, he enters a hallucinatory, cloistered world roughly based on the 16th-century Spanish court, where an unnamed and imprisoned queen, played by artist Penny Goring, believes that she is a walking corpse whose insides have rotted away. I imagine Goring making a great Winnie, up to her neck in sand in Beckett’s Happy Days, getting through the hours as she falls apart. The queen’s plight is based on the terrible story of Joanna, Queen of Castile, sister of Henry VIII’s first wife, Catherine of Aragon. In Cundale’s film, Joanna is seen as suffering from Cotard’s syndrome, a condition linked to severe depression that leads the sufferer to believe that they are already dead. Goring brings her own struggles with trauma and mental illness to her role, just as she does to her art and poetry. The blurring of the boundaries between fact and fiction continue in the casting of Harding’s boxing trainer, Mark Tibbs, in the film, while former boxer Ahmet Patterson, Harding’s opponent, reappears as Harding’s replacement as heir to the Queen’s throne.If all this seems too much, it is. Enter boxing promoter Denia, played by RSC actor Chris New, who brings all his Shakespearean stage skills to his secondary role as the Queen’s jailer and courtier. New cuts a figure of cartoonish evil and intrigue, as much Blackadder as Wolf Hall. Even his lascivious tongue-rolling comes with a deliciously hammy actorliness. I’m not quite sure why he is wearing a corset. The real star here is Goring. I can’t take my eyes off her. The ageing, deluded queen, driven to madness by her situation, has real grandeur and pathos, as well as a taste for slitting throats. Suddenly she’s Judith to New’s Holofernes, having enticed him to her bed. “I’m lonely,” she wails. The blood gushes, but it is nothing a perky black neckerchief can’t assuage. He’s back again in the next scene. Did I mention the maggots? Maggots on the food, wriggling gamely, and maggots dripping from New’s open throat.All this is bunkum, and there’s more of it before we’re done. Guttering candles, a wake for the possibly-dead-but-maybe-not queen, her heart pumping even on her bier, her body decorated with a dessert’s worth of soft fruit as a bedpan of pee is passed around. You couldn’t make all this stuff up, but Cundale did.Tipping into grand guignol, The Near Room collides too many genres and too many themes in too little space. How does it end, you ask. Back in the gym again, punch drunk. What a romp.• Sophie Cundale: The Near Room is at South London Gallery from 15 August to 13 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61502ec83e85a9cac38392e38aead249b31de54c/167_0_3075_1845/master/3075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b81028cab5b892414e9bdb49f941c23b","title":"seven top oil firms downgrade assets by 87bn in nine months","story":"Thinktank says changes to forecasts reflect accelerated shift away from fossil fuelsThe world’s largest listed oil companies have wiped almost $90bn from the value of their oil and gas assets in the last nine months as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates a global shift away from fossil fuels.In the last three financial quarters, seven of the largest oil firms have slashed their forecasts for future oil market prices, triggering a wave of downgrades to the value of their oil and gas projects totalling $87bn.Analysis by the climate finance thinktank Carbon Tracker shows that in the last three month alone, companies including Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total, Chevron, Repsol, Eni and Equinor have reported downgrades on the value of their assets totalling almost $55bn.The oil valuation impairments began at the end of last year in response to growing political support for transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, and they have accelerated as the pandemic has taken its toll on the oil industry.Lockdowns have triggered the sharpest collapse in demand for fossil fuels in 25 years, causing energy commodity markets to crash to historic lows.The oil market collapse, which reached its nadir in April, has forced companies to reassess their expectations for prices in the coming years.BP has cut its oil forecasts by almost a third, to an average of $55 a barrel between 2020 and 2050, while Shell has cut its forecasts from $60 a barrel to an average of $35 a barrel this year, rising to $40 next year, $50 in 2022 and $60 from 2023.Both companies slashed their shareholder payouts after the revisions triggered a $22.3bn downgrade on Shell’s fossil fuel portfolio and a $13.7bn impairment on BP’s oil and gas assets.Andrew Grant, Carbon Tracker’s head of oil, gas and mining, said the coronavirus had accelerated an inevitable trend towards lower oil prices – a trend that many climate campaigners have warned will lead to stranded assets and a deepening risk for pension funds that invest in oil firms.“Covid-19 has certainly done its bit in wiping out value from oil companies’ books, but it’s clear that it has also accelerated a trend of companies changing their longer-term price assumptions to better reflect the realities of the energy transition,” he said.In the last financial quarter of 2019, the French oil company Total and Spain’s Repsol both pointed to government climate policy as the reason for oil valuation downgrades totalling $6.2bn.“The fact that major European players are writing down assets with reference to the Paris agreement is a very positive shift,” Grant said. “Setting impairment prices in line with a conservative estimate of future fossil fuel demand based on the Paris agreement can only help to avoid wasted capital and increase companies’ resilience.”“However, there are laggards,” Grant said. “US oil majors don’t disclose their price assumptions and made little mention of climate change in their quarterly filings. Neither ExxonMobil nor ConocoPhillips have reported any material impairments this year, suggesting management is hanging on to an optimistic view of the oil price.”Norway’s state oil company, Equinor, has broken ranks from its European peers by sticking to its long-term forecasts for the price of Brent crude at $80 a barrel – “the highest by some way,” Grant said.“Stubbornly sticking to business-as-usual price forecasts may lead companies to misallocate capital to the detriment of their investors,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258189be7cf6b309496f86815ae8516ef033e347/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=893528a7b00c6b65a39b0e018f3525e7","title":"when someone you love is dying your sadness is infectious in lockdown this grief is shared","story":"Sometime in March my partner, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer two years ago, started to fadeLast night I broke curfew. I drove home at 8.30pm after delivering my partner to the carpark of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne. Because of the restrictions, I wasn’t allowed to take him up to the ward. Instead I was told to phone when we arrived and someone would meet us. But my phone wouldn’t work in the carpark. It was SOS calls only, and this didn’t register as an emergency. So I had to run up two floors of car ramps, dodging traffic, until I could see some bars and make the call.We were told to come in because he’s been having trouble walking. Because ehe’s unsteady on his feet, the doctors are concerned his cancer has progressed to his spine, impinging on nerves and affecting movement and balance. As I ran back to the car, I felt the enormous gap between us. Me running to make a call so that he could be wheeled away by a nurse to a ward I would never see.Like all nurses I have encountered during my partner’s illness, this nurse breezed in with a smile and made it seem like I was delivering a cake. Relieved at her warmth I saved the tears for the drive home. Alone and after curfew. Royal Parade was empty. Melbourne had shut down for the night.As I unlocked the front door, I could hear our children arguing over whose turn it was to play Zelda on the Nintendo Switch. I bought it on a whim as the second lockdown started, a way to bribe them through their miserable days. Days of online zooms for school, days of watching their dad shrink and sleep and cry. Days of not knowing what is coming next.I was always anti cats and video games, refusing either in the house. Now I have both. Lockdown one provided the kitten, and lockdown two the gaming. I sometimes find myself lost in the middle of the afternoon when I should be working, sitting on the couch with a sleeping cat on my lap trying to kill monsters on a screen and wondering how I got here.We’d just moved when the first lockdown started – taken a lease on a place across the road from the house we’d all loved for nine years. We could see our old roof from the balcony of the new townhouse. Watch the owners rip out trees we’d watered, fix fences we’d painted and gut the garden we’d grown. After a while we stopped looking.Sometime in March my partner, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer two years ago, started to fade. He stopped eating, was in constant pain and spent much of the day in bed. As Covid spread and the restrictions tightened, it became impossible for friends and family to visit. Always a Pollyanna, I found myself getting up at 4am to try to snatch part of the day before remote learning and telehealth stole away the hours. I baked bread, took up online yoga and tried to remain positive.And I mostly did.We survived the first lockdown. We came together as a family. The four of us found new ways to connect and new ways to irritate. We’d go for early night walks around the laneways near our house, stealing fruit from overhanging branches. Sometimes we took the cat with us in a bag, enjoying her wide eyes and manic sniffing. My partner would shuffle along beside us, his usual fast-walking ways slowed by cancer, and we’d have to cut our time short. But at least we were all together.While I hated watching my teenage daughter and 12-year-old son adjust to this new world order, it also meant they’ve had time to be with their dad, to say their own version of farewell and to have access to me every second of the day to answer every morbid question.The kids enjoyed having all of us together for three meals a day. The rules changed. Television was watched nightly, breakfast was eaten late, and nobody seemed to go to bed before 11. We considered showering a small victory. When lockdown one ended and we could have a couple of people in our house, we had a daily stream of disinfected guests. The visits were kept short. My partner would manage to make coffee like he always had, and we’d sit over a metre apart in our lounge, making small talk.There were tears, too. Friends who hadn’t watched the slow decline and instead faced this gaunt man who had changed so much in those first Covid months. Sometimes they’d just sob on sight, and once or twice an illegal hug was had outside our house by people who’d known each other all their adult lives. I can’t speak for how my partner has felt over the past six months, but for me these lockdowns have been like waiting in an airport for a plane that doesn’t come. You can’t leave. You’ve been through customs. But everyone you love is on the other side of the gate.I see my friends in masked glimpses at our door as they drop meals, an already mixed negroni in a thermos and parcels of books. I see some of them for a walk a couple of times a week while we cry at a distance and can’t comfort each other the way we would if hugging was allowed.The sameness of each lockdown day clashes with the changes caused by cancer.While my partner deteriorates, nothing in our daily lives is any different. The highlight is a parcel arriving, or a meal that for once everyone will eat. Mostly it’s endless cups of coffee, three loads of dishes, emptying kitty litter and making sure children leave the house for exercise.And still he fades.Sometimes for a minute or two in the morning when I wake early and drink my coffee with the cat waiting to pounce nearby, I forget what is coming. And when I see him for the first time that day and it all comes smashing back to me, the loneliness of lockdown is almost a relief. It means we can hide away and grieve.When someone you love is dying, you feel different. Your sadness is infectious, and so you lock it up, keeping it to yourself. Lockdown has meant we are strangely free from that. Everybody in Melbourne is sad. We are all grieving. Freedom, friends, lovers. This grief is shared. And it has strangely normalised our lives and for that I’m grateful.It’s the rest of it – the fact I can’t see my family, or hug my friends, or drink a bottle of wine when I need to in someone’s backyard, or even deliver my partner to ward 3A after curfew on a Wednesday – that makes this lockdown so hard. And knowing that he’ll wake up in a hospital bed, without visitors for the day, is perhaps the hardest thing of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e9b2e77217043666a37a099fee33b36d8f55c2/0_50_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f151bb0183d37b8625bfa6b7954f9c","title":"zaido the ancient japanese ritual to bring good luck in pictures","story":"After the death of her father and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Yukari Chikura found solace by travelling to a remote village to document the 1,300-year-old annual ceremony.

An online, booze-free and sexless twist.But, perhaps showing a scintilla of wishful thinking, some students’ unions claim the new freshers’ week is much better suited to a generation Z who are less interested in drinking and smoking.Events organised by Covid-conscious unions to welcome undergraduates include virtual DJ sets, cooking and yoga classes, bingo and movie nights, as well as online escape rooms.While some in-person events will still go ahead, the experience is likely to prove a toned-down affair, with food markets and open-air cinemas being posed as alternatives to boozy club nights.Francesco Masala, president of the University of Bath’s students’ union, said organisers were trying to use social distancing measures as a chance to veer away from traditional freshers’ week events to less alcohol-focused ones, in line with what young people wanted.“They tend to drink less, smoke less and like doing different activities,” he said, adding that this year offered a chance to “move towards a fundamentally new model with more day activities not concentrated on drinking”.Freshers’ week is usually seen as an opportunity for students to make friends and become acquainted with their new neighbourhoods. Among the potential events available to Bath’s new intake are virtual comedy nights and dance classes.Unlike some establishments, such as the University of Bristol, where all events will be held virtually, Bath is also looking to host outdoors events such as an open-air cinema night next to its on-campus lake and a farmers’ market with vendors selling locally sourced produce.“At the top of our list of priorities is trying to make sure students are safe as they come to university because we wouldn’t want them to get Covid because activities were not done in a socially distanced and safe way,” said Masala.At the University of Leeds, digital freshers’ events including virtual escape rooms, yoga and meditation classes will be held into 2021 because of the huge number of international students unable to move to the UK in time for the start of term.While organisers are hopeful such experiences will be popular among students now accustomed to living under a pandemic, Leeds expects the in-person events it will be able to offer – such as an outdoor food festival with bookable tables and themed brunches – could be oversubscribed, with students hungry for real-life action following the national lockdown.“We know that Zoom fatigue is a thing,” said a spokesperson for Leeds’ students’ union. “We could see some of our events being too popular for the capacity that we’ll be able to handle.”They added that the university had also noticed a clear trend in changing appetites for freshers’ experiences in recent years. “Last year we ran a successful night market, with the focus on good food and drinks rather than just alcohol,” they said.Still, with mainstay SU club nights – such as Leeds’ Fruity Friday, or Bath’s toga and safari-themed nights – not going ahead because of the nationwide closure of nightclubs, more hedonistic students may be tempted to look elsewhere during freshers’ week.Students told the  they were “disappointed” that the coronavirus pandemic had fallen on the same year they headed to university, and several said it was naive to believe freshers, many still teenagers, would not attend house parties in place of club nights.Unions have told incoming students looking to party to be wary of commercial operators gambling on restrictions being lifted by selling wristbands to unconfirmed nightclub events.On event sites such as Fatsoma, tickets can still be purchased to freshers’ nights at clubs in university towns including Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle, as well as Bath and Leeds, for as little as £4.“It’s incredibly problematic that they’re almost advertising things as if everything will be normal when in reality it’s not going to be,” said Masala.“Freshers’ week doesn’t have to be any less exciting than previous years,” he added, but “things are going to be different, there is absolutely no way to skirt around it. Anyone who thinks freshers’ week is going to be normal has blinded themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a042a72b270d8bc65b9bb90f8bc70e7ef6c33b65/0_135_1899_1139/master/1899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f04c6731ab7c78ef82bb8508644cba0b","title":"natures furry engineers sea otters in california estuaries surprise scientists aoe","story":"It is not just at sea that North America’s smallest marine mammals with a huge appetite are benefitting the ecosystemWhen Brent Hughes started studying the seagrass beds of Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in Monterey Bay on California’s central coast, he was surprised by what he found. In this highly polluted estuary, excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff spur the growth of algae on seagrass leaves, which kills the plants. Yet in 2010, Hughes noticed that the seagrass beds were thriving. It did not make sense.“This is the highest nutrient concentration that I had ever seen on the planet,” says Hughes, a biologist at Sonoma State University. “Any model would suggest there should be no seagrass there and yet it was expanding.”Hughes set out to solve the mystery. He examined every possible factor, including water quality, temperature and changes in seagrass coverage over time, going back 50 years. He was not making any progress until he was approached by a boat captain named Yohn Gideon who had been running wildlife tours in the slough since 1995. Over the years, the captain had handed clickers to his passengers, asking them to count the sea otters they saw.Hughes overlaid the captain’s sea otter counts with historical seagrass coverage data and realised the two graphs were almost perfectly in sync. When sea otter numbers went up, seagrass went up, too. “You don’t see that very often in ecology. That was a eureka moment,” he says.While Hughes had often encountered sea otters in the slough during his es, he never paid attention to them. Now they were clearly linked to seagrass health, but how? When the otters first moved into the slough in the 1980s, they put their big appetites to work eating crabs. With fewer crabs to prey on them, the California sea hares – a sea slug – grew larger and became more abundant. The slugs fed on the algae growing on the seagrass, leaving the leaves healthy and clean.Sea otters had already shown that they were capable of a large influence on the ecosystem. In the 1970s, biologist James Estes was conducting research in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and noticed some areas where the seafloor was covered with sea urchins. As herbivores, urchins feed on kelp, and when their numbers are not kept in check by predators, no kelp remains. In contrast, in places where sea otters were present, kelp forests were thriving. Estes demonstrated that by eating urchins, sea otters created the opportunity for kelp to flourish. Sea otters gained their official title as a keystone species. But the discovery that sea otters could also be important players in estuaries came as an ecological surprise. In fact, scientists had not even expected sea otters to survive in an estuary.Hunted to near extinction by fur traders in the 18th and 19th centuries, sea otters had only survived in a few small, isolated populations in the North Pacific. Then, after the Fur Seal Treaty was signed in 1911, conservation efforts led to an increase in otter numbers. In California, the population grew from 50 in 1914 to about 3,000. On the coast of British Columbia, they were reintroduced between 1969 and 1972 and there are now about 8,100 of them.Since the otters were first recovering in kelp forests along the open coast, the scientists who studied the animals assumed that this was their primary habitat. When they started turning up in Elkhorn Slough in the 1980s, they thought that was an anomaly, failing to realise that they were in fact reoccupying old habitats.Archaeological and historical records indicate that otters were once abundant in California’s estuaries, prior to being driven to local extinction through over-hunting. “Scientists are subject to perception bias,” says Tim Tinker, a wildlife biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “Estuaries were traditionally very important to otters. But we did not really appreciate them as such. The ecological effects of otters on the outer coast dominated our thinking.”Estuaries were not even considered in the US fish and wildlife service’s plan for the recovery of the sea otter in California, listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act.Now, scientists and wildlife managers are turning to estuaries as potential places where sea otter numbers could grow. In the past decade, the expansion of sea otters on the California coast has been curbed unexpectedly by the presence of the great white sharks that are recovering from overfishing and by-catch, at the southern and northern edges of the otter range. Shark bites have become the primary source of otter mortality. “The population is constrained by a shark wall,” Tinker says.Estuaries could provide otters with an important refuge from sharks and other unfavourable coast conditions, such as storms and warming events. A recent paper suggests that San Francisco Bay, California’s largest estuary, could support about 6,000 otters, more than double the current population. “Once fully recovered, between a quarter and one third of the entire population in California could be accounted for by otters living in estuaries,” Tinker says.Scientists also believe that sea otters could be conservation allies, with their potential to help restore other polluted estuaries in California. “It is a two-way street,” Tinker says. “To have a resilient population of sea otters we may need them in estuaries but estuaries may also need sea otters.”Seagrass ecosystems perform important ecological functions. They provide nursery habitat for young fish and invertebrates, and they protect shorelines from storms and waves. They control erosion by holding down and trapping sediment. Seagrass absorbs carbon from the atmosphere and buries it in its roots, acting as a carbon sink.In south-east Alaska and British Columbia, scientists are studying other ways that otters may be beneficial to seagrass beds. “Anywhere sea otters are going, I can guarantee change is going to happen,” Hughes says.But the long-term influence of these furry ecosystem engineers is not yet fully understood.For example, when sea otters look for clams to eat, they dig in the seagrass beds, leaving holes behind. “When you are watching otters digging for clams, you can see a cloud of sediment come up to the surface,” says Erin Foster, a marine ecologist studying the interactions between otters and seagrass at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia.“It looks like a bombed-out landscape when you come across a fresh site where there has been recent digging,” adds Margot Hessing-Lewis, also a marine ecologist with the Hakai Institute.Foster and Hessing-Lewis are investigating the possibility that when sea otters disturb the sediment they could be helping seagrass become more resilient to environmental changes by making the seagrass flower more often, potentially increasing the genetic ersity of the plants.As scientists are still learning about the full impact of sea otters on different habitats, they wonder about assisting the growth of the population, especially in California where the shark predation is making it difficult for otters to expand into new areas. Elkhorn Slough was the first estuary in California recolonised by sea otters, a process that was greatly accelerated by the release in the slough of 37 otters that had been rescued and rehabilitated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in the 2000s.Future otter releases could be strategically used to help sea otter populations expand in other historic habitats, though it is not always without risk. Otters could be exposed to the threat of boat strikes, oil spills, human disturbances, and contamination from chemical pollutants. The return of this top predator also comes at a cost to humans, since sea otters compete directly with shellfish fisheries which had developed in their absence. A recent study that analysed the costs and benefits linked to the reintroduction of sea otters to the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia found the benefits – including increasing fish populations, carbon sequestration and ecotourism – outweighed the losses to invertebrate fisheries by seven times.However, the benefits are not felt equally, especially among indigenous communities who rely on shellfish harvesting for food security.“Sea otter recovery is different from the recovery of any other species because they have such disproportionally big effects on the ecosystem,” Tinker says. “For most depleted species you are just worried about the conservation of the species but with sea otters, you are thinking how the entire ecosystem is going to change when they recover.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68178702f6d314ae0430fd33d22302d3ed01773f/0_370_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7c497fff9564c4c525e0b16bf42e042","title":"uk staycations countryside coast visitors trail of destruction","story":"Countryside and coastal custodians lament ‘different demographic’ of visitors leaving litter and endangering wildlifeFires caused by portable barbecues, wild flowers being dug up, the disturbance of shorebirds, and an avalanche of rubbish. These are just some of the threats to Britain’s wild places as record numbers enjoy coastal and countryside “staycations”.Beleaguered rangers complain that a new generation of holidaymakers are treating the countryside like a festival site, leaving behind tents, chairs and excrement, as well as endangering rare habitats and wildlife.“It’s like no previous law of behaviour applies,” said one warden in Devon, whosecoastal nature reserve has been the busiest he has seen it in 40 years. “Anything you would expect people to understand, such as littering or people using the countryside as a lavatory, they ignore.”Conservationists and landowners are particularly concerned by the escalating fire risk with tinderbox conditions at many beauty spots, and a surge in wild campers – or “fly-campers” – lighting fires and portable barbecues.A fire destroyed 140 acres of heathland on Chobham Common, Surrey, last weekend. During the last bank holiday weekend, more than 20 serious moorland and grassland fires devastated areas in the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales and New Forest.The British Mountaineering Council is calling for the use of disposable barbecues on open moorland to be made a criminal offence.In Dartmoor, one of the few places in England where wild camping is legal, the Dartmoor National Park Authority has deployed emergency powers to temporarily ban wild camping after a dramatic increase in “fly-camping” at Bellever, where more than 50 fire pits were dug into the moor on one night. The authorities hope the August-long ban will give the beauty spot time to recover.Craig Best, the National Trust’s countryside manager for West Yorkshire, said his team feared a big moorland fire. “We’ve got the bank holiday weekend looming and even when the moorlands are tinder-dry there’ll be every chance two or three iniduals will be having a barbecue there, and they can so easily get out of control,” he said.“It’s almost like a perfect storm,” he added, citing the combination of post-lockdown liberation, the heatwave and the long closure of household recycling centres, which caused a huge increase in fly-tipping.Problems reported by rangers include unprecedented wild camping in the Lake District huge quantities of nitrous oxide canisters discarded over Marsden Moor, close to Manchester, Leeds and Huddersfield illegal speedboating in the Ore estuary in Suffolk and huge quantities of excrement, even where toilets are open because visitors are avoiding public toilets due to coronavirus fears.The Devon coastal reserve warden, who asked to remain anonymous, said he found a family had dismantled a “dead hedge” (a feature used to provide wildlife habitat) to make a teepee, decorating it with yellow flag irises that they dug up. “They just couldn’t understand that it wasn’t acceptable,” he said.Some visitors have argued that pictures of rubbish piled up beside bins demonstrate that more bins are required, or that they need emptying more regularly. But conservationists say people should take their rubbish home.“You’re seeing the worst part of human nature and a deterioration in the habitats you’re trying to manage because you’re having to concentrate on emptying bins,” said the Devon warden.Jake Fiennes, the director of the Holkham estate, which manages England’s largest national nature reserve, said 20,000 people were visiting the estate’s beach, in the Norfolk Coast area of natural beauty, each day. Reported incidents include kites being flown where terns nest, disturbing the birds, and a resting seal pup being picked up and flung back into the water.“It’s crazy, absolutely crazy. Every day feels like an August bank holiday,” Fiennes said. “It’s a totally different demographic – north Norfolk coast visitors are usually pretty middle class but we’re not seeing the older birders anymore, we’re seeing a lot of young people. The positive is we have a chance to engage with a whole different section of society.”Fiennes said knowledge of the Countryside Code seemed to have “fallen by the wayside” among today’s young. “Shouldn’t the natural world be part of our national curriculum?” he asked.But conservationists are desperate not to appear unwelcoming to a new generation of younger, urban visitor.“We’ve got to be careful as a sector about saying you can only come into the countryside if you’ve studied the Countryside Code,” said Ben McCarthy, the National Trust’s head of nature and conservation ecology. “The long-term solution to recovering nature has to be better engagement and better experiences for the widest range of the public. There’s good evidence that once people have positive experiences in nature they start to have pro-environmental attitudes.”Nikki Williams of The Wildlife Trusts said the tension between unprecedented numbers of visitors and rare species in fragile habitats showed the importance of ensuring people had access to local nature and didn’t simply drive to beauty-spots.“You go to a place labelled ‘countryside’. It’s a visitor experience, whereas it should be integrated into our lives,” she said. “We advocate for a nature recovery network. A really important part of that is more on-your-doorstep nature. Then you start to understand more about nature and you also don’t get in the car and drive to a place that has a line drawn around it and says ‘This is where the good stuff is.’”The Wildlife Trusts are particularly concerned that the government’s new planning white paper ides the country into protected zones and areas of development and regeneration – exacerbating the idea that “nature” is an excursion to an overvisited, distant nature reserve.Nick Bruce-White, the RSPB’s regional director of southern England, said: “This interest in the outdoors and green space is something we couldn’t have wished for six months ago. I hope we can build on it. There’s a small minority of people who are doing wantonly illegal things and a bigger cohort of new visitors who, without sounding too patronising, don’t understand the basics of how to use the countryside appropriately.”Bruce-White said the RSPB, alongside the National Farmers’ Union and others, were pushing the government to include more messaging about responsible enjoyment of the countryside in its Covid-19 broadcasts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/985ae3bd1f8fb3dac6a1d68c661e0ca62b226c97/552_67_3033_1820/master/3033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f992742318d1c61724aadac88b4008","title":"get ready to come out of orbit with the re entry dress","story":"It’s time to take off that lockdown tracksuit and put on this summer’s hit dress: black, short, loose and perfect for Zoom calls and picnic rugs alikeThis summer of tentative re-engagement with normality has its first dress code. The tracksuits that were the uniform of lockdown have been replaced by the “re-entry dress”: a short, voluminous black dress that is Zoom-friendly yet picnic-appropriate, with a nod to Marianne in Normal People and puff sleeves for built-in social distancing. This new take on the classic little black dress is emerging as the sequel to Zara’s monochrome polka-dot dress, the surprise hit of last summer.“One is never overdressed or underdressed in a little black dress,” said the late Karl Lagerfeld. The go-anywhere properties of the LBD are being rediscovered as women dress to cover all bases in the current social twilight zone. With most office-based employees still working from home but government messaging – and the eat out to help out scheme – encouraging us to return to pubs and restaurants, the dress is proving popular across the booming wardrobe categories of WFH, Zoom-dressing, al-fresco socialising and staycationing.The 2020 renaissance of the puff-sleeved little black dress was set in motion two years ago at Vanity Fair’s Oscars party, by the model Kendall Jenner in a short black dress with outsize puff sleeves by the ethical Italian brand Redemption, which donates half its profits to charity. At London fashion week this year, the style made a strong showing in Simone Rocha’s autumn collection.After the pandemic hit, the LBD was boosted by the BBC drama series Normal People, in which the character of Marianne (played by Daisy Edgar-Jones) was hailed a lockdown Venus, with a standout black sundress providing much-needed glamour when it was sorely lacking. The logistics of this summer’s park- and garden-based social life have popularised dark colours for grass-stain resistance. A loose silhouette lends itself to the picnic rug, which has replaced the bar stool for cocktail-hour seating. And dramatic puffed sleeves – until recently considered a catwalk affectation – have become a practical social-distancing aid.

It doesn’t matter what films he makes any more so long as there’s a scene where he grits his jaw and pumps his arms while he tears along at an improbable speed, people will buy tickets. This is why nobody seemed to be too cut up when Top Gun 2 was yanked from summer schedules. There isn’t enough space inside the cockpit of a cutting edge fighter jet to let him run around, so what’s the point in even watching it?However there are now whispers about the secrets of Cruise’s screen running. Namely, it only looks so impressive because he bans everyone else from running on screen at the same time as him. Think about it. In Vanilla Sky he ran alone. In Minority Report he ran alone. In the Mission: Impossible films he runs alone. In War of the Worlds people tried to run with him, but the aliens vaporised them for their insubordination. In Collateral he chases after people a lot and always catches them because he is Tom Cruise, and therefore essentially two big pistons perched on top of a human torso.We know about Cruise’s no-run rule because Annabelle Wallis, Cruise’s co-star in The Mummy, has claimed in an interview that she alone possessed the moral fortitude and skills of persuasion necessary to break him down.So that’s it. The answer isn’t that Cruise won’t run with anybody on screen because they might make him look bad. It’s that he can run at such an alarmingly speedy rate that most other mere mortal actors would simply look like puffy old globs of cholesterol next to him.Either way, it’s good to know that lockdown has given us the opportunity to learn all the weird things that people in the film industry hate on their sets. Anne Hathaway claimed that Christopher Nolan hates chairs. Wallis claims that Cruise hates other runners. There’s no end to Covid in sight, so who knows what we’ll learn next. Does Martin Scorsese possess an irrational fear of moustaches? Could Daniel Day-Lewis be enraged to the point of apoplexy by geese? Does Vince Vaughn hate ham? At this stage it’s essentially a waiting game.But I’m afraid that I have to pour cold water on the Cruise no-run hypothesis. Because although Wallis ran with him on-screen in 2017, you only need to look back one year earlier to see a scene where Cruise runs with another person.Remember Jack Reacher: Never Go Back? Remember that scene 28 minutes in? You know, the one scene in the entire movie where Jack doesn’t tell people how he’s going to beat them up right before beating them up, or peripheral characters explain in hugely unnecessary detail how good Jack is at everything? That’s right, it’s the scene where Cruise and his co-star Cobie Smulders inexplicably sprint for a taxi past the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool because they both want to go to an internet cafe.So there. Unfortunately this is fake news. The truth is that Cruise does run with other people on camera. But he only does it in really bad films."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5a63091946f689296ef0fe970e014cb3ad4ee95/0_161_4332_2599/master/4332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63937b27ee19a697821130cb99ea8a2f","title":"barcelona v bayern munich champions league quarter final live","story":"Barcelona were an historic shambles, Bayern simply brilliant on a jaw-dropping night in LisbonA penny for the thoughts of Pep Guardiola, whose Manchester City will face Bayern in the semi-final should they see off Lyon tomorrow night. Goodness knows how that one would end, both sides blessed with outrageously good attacks but not quite so dependable defences. First things first for City, though, and the conquerors of Juventus will be no Barca-style pushover. Hope you can join us for that one tomorrow evening. In the meantime, here’s Jacob Steinberg’s take on an outrageous brouhaha in Lisbon. Enjoy that, and thanks for reading this report. Nighty night!The view from Barcelona, courtesy of the good doctor.An extremely content Thomas Muller, the official man of the match, speaks. “It is tough to explain. In this moment our team is in an incredible shape. Thank you for the man-of-the-match trophy, but I think we have 12 or 15 more players who deserve this as well. We worked so hard, we worked with intensity, it is tough to beat us. We had so much fun today. They have special players, we have to be even more aggressive and come back again and again. There is a moment when we catch the ball and we have so much talent in the offensive line. We feel good. It is a big statement, but I think the next game, the semi-final, starts 0-0! We have to win the next game. We have to be relaxed and very happy, but when we wake up tomorrow we have to focus. We are not here to win the quarter, we are here to win the semi, and then the final. Most of the time after big wins, it’s more difficult so we have to be careful.”Hans-Dieter Flick and Quique Setién embrace. The Bayern boss almost has to prop Setién up, so stunned is the Barca manager. Setién stumbles off out of sight. At least their fans weren’t in the stadium to deliver their verdict. Unfortunately a few TV cameras were whirring away and the word will be out back home. He’s a goner. Bayern, by contrast, were quite magnificent, a proper team unit in the sense that it’s very difficult to pick a man of the match for them, so well did everyone play. Special mention for Alphonso Davies, though, for the outrageous skill that set up Bayern’s fifth. And if you thought I was exaggerating by suggesting Bayern could have scored 15: they had 26 attempts at goal tonight, compared to Barcelona’s eight. Bayern even scored one of Barca’s for them. Bayern were so good. Barcelona were beyond pathetic. It’s not all bad news for Barca, mind you: Bayern could easily have scored about 15.90 min +1: Vidal shoves Tolisso in the chest, then slams the ball into the ground when penalised by the ref. He’s the second Barca player who could have seen red but is shown just yellow by the ref.90 min: There will be two minutes of additional time. “Neymar must be glad he didn’t stick around long enough to become part of this Brazil 2014 Tribute Act,” quips Justin Kavanagh.A ball swung left for Tolisso, who heads across for Coutinho, on the edge of the six-yard box. Touch, bang, eight. Barcelona are a risible disgrace.88 min: Coutinho again down the left. Another shot, this one nearly deflected into the top left. A corner, that leads to nothing.87 min: Quique Setién looks like a condemned man. Quique Setién is a condemned man. Messi loses the ball and doesn’t bother trying to get it back. Muller slips a pass down the left for Coutinho, who shimmies into the box, cuts inside, and whips a shot into the bottom left. He doesn’t celebrate, parent-club protocol and all that. This is the first time since 1949 that Barcelona have conceded seven.85 min: Kimmich is booked for irritating Suarez. And then ...84 min: Nope. No offside! All good! Barca’s humiliation grows and grows. Hernandez and Tolisso come on for Goretzka and Davies.83 min: VAR is checking this for offside. They’re taking an age.Coutinho sha-booms down the left again and dinks infield for Lewandowski, who heads home from a couple of yards. Once again: it’s as easy as that.81 min: Coutinho probes down the left. No way through this time. “Mes que un shambles,” suggests marketing guru Matt Dony.79 min: Davies is unpretentiously hacked down in the 1970s style by Vidal, who brazenly waves his finger in the ref’s face upon the award of a free kick. The set piece leads to Coutinho winning a corner on the left the corner leads to nothing.77 min: Messi dribbles down the inside-left channel and takes a weak shot that’s easy meat for Neuer.76 min: Boateng and Gnabry are replaced by Sule and Coutinho, coming on against his parent club.75 min: I wonder how many Gerd Muller would have got tonight? A number too big for a brain to contain.74 min: Lewandowksi has a crack from a tight angle on the left. He’s desperate for a goal. It’s how great strikers think.72 min: Barca haven’t given up a chance for three minutes now. Another small acorn!70 min: Busquets is replaced by Ansu Fati.69 min: From the resulting corner, Gnabry has a shot blocked. They could easily have racked up ten tonight. They may still do. Barcelona are a sorry state indeed.68 min: Davies is able to continue. Coman comes on for Perisic, and should score with his first touch, Semedo shipping possession out on the left, Lewandowski teeing him up, Alba deflecting his shot over the bar.67 min: A pause as Davies and Semedo meet again. This time it’s a painful encounter for Davies, as the pair clash heads accidentally and the brilliant young full back comes off worse.65 min: Barca have been faffing around at the back to an absurd degree all evening. Once again they give up possession like feckless dandies, allowing Kimmich to literally stroll into their box on the right. They’re extremely fortunate that Kimmich floats a weak cross into Ter Stegen’s arms.This is a quite sensational goal. Davies is out on the left touchline. He’s faced by Semedo. He gives him the eyes, then shimmies his hips, and tears off from a standing start towards the byline. Semedo is toast. Pique backs off fatally, allowing Davies to dribble closer and closer to the goal, before reaching the left-hand post and pulling back for Kimmich to slam home. What a dribble that was! What a talent Davies is.61 min: The ref goes over to tell the Barca bench to simmer down. They’re on a rolling boil over that Suarez free kick (i.e. very little).59 min: Barca looked utterly listless before that goal. Now the fire’s back in their bellies. Perhaps a little too much? Suarez clips Goretzka, then Alba, incensed at the correct award of a free kick, flings the ball in anger at the referee! He should be walking for that, but instead it’s just a yellow. He doesn’t acknowledge the referee upon receiving the booking. He’s really pushing his luck.Out of nothing! Messi swings a pass down the left for Alba, who pulls back for Suarez on the edge of the box. Suarez shapes to go inside, but drops a shoulder to send Boateng away, then steps into the box down the inside-left channel before whipping a shot into the bottom right. Game on?56 min: Boateng gives away a needless corner with a misplaced backpass. Nothing happens at the set piece.54 min: Suarez is booked for a late, frustrated clip on Thiago.53 min: ... Bayern break upfield, four on three. Lewandowski barges down the left and cuts inside. He loses possession but the ball breaks to Muller inside the box. Muller rounds Ter Stegen and tees up Lewandowski, who slots home. But it’s disallowed, Muller having been caught well offside.52 min: Davies is booked for flapping his arm in Vidal’s face. It’s a free kick to Barca, just to the right of the Bayern box. And from that ...51 min: Kimmich floats a pass down the inside-right channel. Goretzka barrels through the huge hole in the Barca defence, chests down, and hoicks over. It’s fairly clear that Bayern have yet to declare.49 min: Neuer launches a drop kick down the middle. Muller is suddenly clear of the Barca defence! It’s really that easy. Muller hasn’t quite got the pace to stay ahead of Langlet, but holds him off, spins, and tees up Perisic, who blazes a first-time daisycutter straight at Ter Stegen. A yard either side and that would have been the fifth, with Bayern having to do very little.48 min: Lewandowski glances a smart header down the right to release Perisic. He cuts back but can’t quite find the in-rushing Muller. Barca mop up.47 min: It’s already attack versus defence again. Lewandowski teases Semedo down the left. He thinks about crossing. Vidal arrives on the scene to blooter the ball away with extreme prejudice and great feeling.Barca trudge back onto the pitch, defeat already writ large across every face. Bayern stop just short of walking on air. Barca have made one change, swapping Sergi Roberto for Antoine Griezmann. Bayern get the ball rolling again.Half-time postbag ... because, well, y’know, come on, give me a break.“Bayern’s pressing tonight is something that Klopp would be very proud of they are relentless. I am decidedly not a fan of either of these clubs and do not like what their dominanceriches are doing to their respective domestic leagues, but I will put that aside for a moment and admit that this is excellent entertainment and that I am enjoying it hugely” - Adam Kline-Schoder“How Barcelona have not replaced Piqué and Alba in the last five years is beyond explanation. Busquet has looked past his best for two years now. Him, Sergi Roberto, and Semedo are not even pretending to care about protecting the comedy show that is Piqué and Lenglet. The less said about Suárez, the better. This entire squad needs a major refresh” - Billy Graboso“You’re doing a fantastic job there, Scott, but I’m beginning to think what this this might need a stenographer” - Stelios Jackson (who is now officially permitted to speak for me in all negotiations with management)“Barcelona’s back four look like they’ve been drilled using George Graham’s old defensive coaching method ... except they forgot to untie the rope” - Justin Kavanagh“Barcelona, as a club, are massively, spectacularly, in the shite” - Stephen Carr Bayern were magnificent going forward, but Barcelona’s defence ... goodness me. Unless he’s got the mother of all half-time speeches tucked up his sleeve, Quique Setién won’t be in a job this time tomorrow. 45 min: Suarez takes advantage of a loose ball 25 yards from the Bayern goal. He gives it a good old hoof, with much feeling, but it’s straight at Neuer.44 min: Thiago swings a glorious pass wide right for Muller, who kills it and instantly sends Kimmich away down the channel. Barca would be in real trouble, but fortunately for them, Kimmich stands on the ball, effectively tackling himself.42 min: Boateng is booked for cynically bringing down Suarez, as the Barca forward looks to launch a quick break. He had Messi on one side, De Jong on the other, so the Bayern defender can have no complaints.41 min: Space for Semedo down the right, sent scampering away by Sergi Roberto. He crosses fiercely for Suarez, totally free in the middle ... but the flag goes up for offside. Barca may be a beaten docket at the back, but they’re still carrying a semblance of a threat up the other end.39 min: Kimmich having won a corner, Lewandowski wins a header. Easy as that, practically unchallenged on the penalty spot. Barca are extremely fortunate that Lewandowski’s downward header is straight at Ter Stegen.38 min: Davies drives down the left. Kimmich drives down the right. This is beyond embarrassing. Barcelona’s defenders are spinning like teenagers after three cans of warm Special Brew.36 min: Ter Stegen and Pique get themselves into another awful muddle, allowing Perisic to steal the ball on the left-hand corner of the box. He whips towards the top right, but doesn’t get enough curl on his shot. Never mind! A fair chance another opportunity will be along in a minute.35 min: Sergi Roberto’s clever flick allows Semedo to move towards the Bayern box on the right. But matters are soon over-complicated and the ball’s soon in Neuer’s hands.34 min: A corner for Barcelona! Sadly it’s a complete non-event, but small acorns and all that.32 min: Barcelona are a risible shambles. Goretzka drives down the middle and tries to pass the ball into the bottom-right corner from the edge of the D. A wee bit too cute, that, and Ter Stegen watches the ball trundle harmlessly past the post.Lewandowski nearly wins a header from Perisic’s left-wing cross. Not quite. Kimmich returns it low towards the near post. Muller, channelling the Brazil-Germany game at the 2014 World Cup, pokes home from close range."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9662a07d27cb740ceab1b96324e3e71b91678f6a/0_3_1023_614/master/1023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccdbd69766d8bd4e37eb8a897430b5c2","title":"families trying to cross the channel dunkirk france","story":"More families arrive in Dunkirk each day and they would rather sleep in woods than seek asylum in France“They are kids, so they are always playing. Like children in the UK play mums and dads or doctors and nurses, our children will re-enact boat crossings, getting patted down by the police, going to food distributions, meeting smugglers. Because one of the way parents safeguard their children is to present attempted border crossings as an adventure.”In a nature reserve near Dunkirk, Caia Fallowfield runs a play project for migrant children who live among the trees with no running water or toilets. These are the children who vanish overnight off the French coast and reappear on the front pages of British newspapers, being pulled out of dinghies in Dover, often cold, wet and frightened.“When you see them in the photos, it’s a relief. They haven’t drowned, they might now get to go to school. You see the impact here of them being out of school. They have speech delays, they have no fine motor skills.”The older children suffer most, she says. “They are conscious of what they are missing out on. They know what it is to sleep in a bed and feel safe.”This week as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel promised to make the Channel crossings “unviable”, more families arrived each day in Dunkirk. Parents came carrying babies or pushing toddlers in buggies, older children stepping in to translate.Last year Project Play worked with around 1,300 children in northern France, most of them trying to reach the UK. Turnover is faster now and children do not stay as long. With the number of lorry journeys through the tunnel down owing to coronavirus lockdown measures, more than 4,000 people have made it to Britain by sea this year.Last weekend, as volunteers from the Refugee Women’s Centre walked through the nature reserve looking for people who might need help, a family stepped out of the trees.Father, mother and grandmother, they had three children with them aged two to seven. They had arrived on a lorry from Romania and the father was desperate to find somewhere for them to sleep.The father pulled his smiling seven-year-old forward and asked him to open his mouth. The boy grinned with a row of rotting, blackened teeth. “We had no access to any healthcare or a dentist in Romania. We were in a tiny room, five of us in 5 by 3 metres, no school or healthcare for eight months,” he said.He wants to be near the Channel in case he can cross. “If we make it to the UK, my children can go to school. And I’d rather spend years here than get sent back to Iraq.”Though it is hard to grasp at first sight why any family would sleep in a wood rather than apply for asylum in France, the families and the charities who support them say the official accommodation centres are dirty, frightening and inappropriate for vulnerable families.Armed police try to get families on to buses, tearing up tents. After a certain number of days families must apply to stay in France, and many do not want to do that.One father told Fallowfield: “If the French would give us even basic support, I would go to the accommodation centre for my children’s sake. But they treat us like animals.”Like other families here, he sees trying to reach the UK as his only option. “I have destroyed my life for my children to have a better future. I don’t want my kids to grow up where someone can brainwash them and make them kill for a living. Islamic State came to our country and that’s why I have come to this shit place. It’s the hardest job in the world being a parent.”The numbers here are a fraction of all the children seeking protection across Europe. In Greece, 25,000 under-18s arrived last year, most with their families. Unicef say there is a desperate need for more safe routes to resettlement.Every night those families in France who can, try to cross the Channel. On Thursday morning a group of around 80 people got into a boat.  spoke by phone to a Turkish academic who was with them.“We didn’t want to get in this boat but the smugglers forced us. It was terrifying, we only got a short way from shore and a wash hit us. One child went overboard but we got them back. We screamed for help but nobody came,” he said.The families made it back to shore where they walked, without shoes and dripping wet, until a charity found them and took them back to find them somewhere to sleep.Lira (not her real name) said that would end her attempts to cross the Channel by boat. “I will never do this again. I will have to find another way.”The children had already recovered from the trauma, she said. “They are children, so they are cheerful again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6051c1b253399f7dc419186daae6e81f933e2bb3/1_0_1999_1200/master/1999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a639b2622c2a3d57c9af0405b1183fd3","title":"boyfriend make jokes try to discuss our future","story":"Put the emphasis on conversation, not confrontation, says Annalisa Barbieri. And invite him to spell out what he does and doesn’t want from lifeMy boyfriend and I have had a lot of serious conversations about marriage and kids, as those are things we want in the next two years. We are both single parents to two-year-old boys, and we’d like to add two or three more children to our family. The problem is that when the conversation turns serious, he immediately starts making jokes, and comes across as if the discussion isn’t important to him. Even when he says he wants to have a serious discussion and initiates it, it’s in such a joking manner that I don’t know whether or not he is being serious.I’ve explained that it irritates me, that I don’t feel heard, and it pushes me away, because I don’t feel as if I know the real him. I’ve explained that I prefer these conversations to have a serious tone, because no one in my family is able to talk about serious things without balking, or leaving the discussion altogether. I understand that he may be using it to cope because he’s not had many of these conversations (his parents are very buttoned up about serious issues).I don’t want him to feel as if I’m trying to control his emotions and the way he reacts to things, but I’m starting to see it as him not being able to be vulnerable and genuine with me about his thoughts and feelings.There could be a few reasons he doesn’t want to talk too seriously, even if he initiates it – and one of them might be that he doesn’t feel the same as you do about your futures, but is scared to tell you. He might not be reticent about everything you have planned, just parts of it: he might just not be in the same place as you yet. It sounds as if you both have quite a lot going on already, so he may want to keep things as they are for a while.You say he starts making jokes the moment the conversation gets serious, and, as I understand it, that’s a change from previous behaviour. Do you know when this started to happen? Or does he begin to make jokes at the mention of a particular subject – in which case, you may need to look at what that is. In your (understandable) need for answers, might you have changed the way you start a conversation? Because we do often need to look at our own place in these things.I contacted psychotherapist Chris Mills about your problem. Mills was hopeful: “The good news is that you’ve had serious conversations before, so clearly the template is there, but if you’ve both grown up with parents who were no good at talking about serious stuff then confidence on how to find a shared ‘tone’ might be low. Awkwardness or anxiety could cause one to come across as rather intense and the other to seem jokey and ungrounded.”He also suggested an exercise that allows you both to talk about what you do and don’t want to happen in the future. “You could say something like, ‘Thinking about the next few years, what would be your top three things for us to get in place? And what three things are you equally sure you don’t want to happen? Why don’t you start and then I’ll tell you what mine are.’” This approach is useful, because it’s a conversation, not a confrontation.I also wondered if something in your relationship has changed and you’ve become the person who moves the relationship forward and has “the conversations”. “I often see this,” explained Mills (whose speciality is couples), “in heterosexual couples where the man ‘defers’ the emotional communication to the woman and tries to keep his own feelings hidden, as if they’re irrelevant or a nuisance, or in danger of upsetting the woman, whom he mistakenly feels is his job to keep happy.”If your boyfriend still won’t, or can’t, talk to you, then I think you need to ask him when would be a good time for him to talk. And if that time never seems to come, then I’m afraid you may need to be having a very different sort of conversation. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

The trick is being ready to lay down the welcome matThe problem with most books (and articles and podcasts) about “being here now” or “embracing the present moment” is that they really aren’t. As often telegraphed by their cover images (sunsets, flowers, mountain peaks) they’re about embracing the nice bits of the present. And they generally imply that if you follow their advice, you could float contentedly through life, relishing simple pleasures and finding wonder in the everyday. In other words, they’re about the ideal person you might become if you weren’t so prone to irritability, boredom and gloom. So they’re not actually about embracing the present at all. They’re focused on escaping it, in pursuit of a better future.None of which could be said about Death: The End Of Self-Improvement, the latest book by the spiritual teacher Joan Tollifson. That title alone is a bracing bucket of iced water to the head. Mortality is the ultimate reminder that our fantasies of someday finally becoming perfect are inherently absurd, because that’s not how the journey will end. All we have, in place of that imagined ascent toward perfection, is a succession of present moments – until, one day, we won’t have any more. And “when the future disappears,” Tollifson writes, “we are brought home to the immediacy that we may have avoided all our lives.” If you really want to be here now, forget flowers and sunsets. Contemplate death instead.Tollifson does so, without flinching. Among other things, the book is a memoir of her own encounters with mortality: her mother’s death, and those of close friends, then an unsparing account of her own experience of ageing – the “sagging, drooping, bulging, wrinkling, and drying up”, then colonoscopies, cancer and chemo, rectal bleeding and stoma bags. Sometimes, the reader wants to flinch. But in a way that’s no bad thing: all of this is part of experience, too. It’s not nice. But any approach to life that brackets it off as some kind of mistake, something that mustn’t be acknowledged, isn’t engaging with how things really are.We tend to assume, Tollifson writes, that a life of dignity “means being in control, not being overwhelmed by emotion, not screaming or crying in pain, not losing control of our bowels, not losing our minds, and so on”. But perhaps there’s more dignity in deciding not to run from what can’t be outrun. “Old age,” she goes on, “is an adventure in uselessness, loss of control, being nobody and giving up everything.” The challenge is to see which new experiences of decay and decline you’re able to welcome – since they will, in any case, be showing up at your door. Joan Tollifson explores the freedom in being ‘awake right now to whatever shows up’ in a number of talks on YouTube"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f164bb81e393264b61d82a3cd5e51e3b6e15e25/183_147_1385_831/master/1385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8a324408993f4a1d758ad6890c8c6f8","title":"when argue with my mother what is it really about","story":"It can’t just be generational differences that turn George Clooney’s facial hair into a rowMy mother and I are very close, but we have our differences. I’ve tended to think they’re generational, even though suggesting so can lead to a familiar place (eg, Mum, intentionally in earshot, pleading with the heavens: “What did I do to deserve this ungrateful daughter who does not respect her elders’ wisdom?”).Sometimes our happiest chats become arguments, the flame of fight ignited subtly, catching us unaware. For a while I thought this was an inevitable byproduct of our differing worldviews, which (conveniently) fit an “old v young” or “west v east” narrative. Even idle chats about personal preference went this way. Take beards: I like them, she doesn’t. I say they might be popular with younger men because they demonstrate carefreeness, and she says that’s a western perspective because for many beards are a sign of religious dogma. The latest one: working from home. Her being older is surely why, no matter how many times I explain that I am not available for calls, errands or impromptu meet-ups when working in this new norm, the requests still come. But when I hear Mum talking beards with someone else – no spikiness in her voice, nor snipe in her rebuttals – I can no longer deny the truth: differing worldviews doesn’t explain how George Clooney’s facial hair became a row. Indeed, it is only with those we love that such madness is made – a personal tension or anxiety unresolved.How many heated family debates are merely proxies for something else, I wonder? I’m not sure I’ll ever know. But when the tears next stream and the voices next shout, I’ve learned to ask: why are we really fighting? Because sometimes the argument isn’t the point, but finding out what is just might be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27858b2d0a6e3a8cfe7c5d26965ea7c440c69866/0_253_2179_1307/master/2179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0881c0bfacefbab9eb9977ce1225ca24","title":"allotment life in bristol in pictures","story":"Bristol photographer Chris Hoare’s Growing Spaces, a project focusing on local allotments.

Recent graduates will see even more added to the sum they owe.It also comes against the backdrop of the A-level furore that has left thousands of students wondering whether they have the grades to get into university, and whether they can afford it, given that part-time work will be hard to come by for the foreseeable future.A student in England on a typical three-year course with fees of £9,250 a year and a £6,378 a year maintenance loan can expect to graduate with £46,884 of debt – before any cumulative interest is added.Campaigners have long called on the student loan scheme to be replaced with something fairer. In 2017, one of Theresa May’s former chiefs of staff described student loans as an “ultimately pointless Ponzi scheme”.The Department for Education said: “We want everyone with the talent and potential to benefit from a university education, which is why loans are available to all students regardless of background or financial history. Changes to interest rates will have no impact on monthly repayments because these are based on income, not the interest rate or amount borrowed.”Helen Saxon, the banking editor at MoneySavingExpert, said: “While an interest rate rise may seem unfair and unwarranted when so many are struggling with their finances due to the coronavirus, it’s not actually as bad as it seems. Most people will never fully repay their student loan before it gets wiped after around 30 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0439b49157176ef0af1e2dde93d679ae95a9da13/0_0_3059_1836/master/3059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a7b7bb1d52780abd51fb1e842b36a31","title":"burna boy twice as tall review nigeria pop polymath","story":"(Atlantic)By rooting modern production in traditional melody, and drawing on various musical styles while staying true to African pop, Burna Boy defines multilayered black identityFor a vivid snapshot of what Burna Boy is capable of, head for track 12 of new album Twice as Tall, entitled Monsters You Made. The music is modern Africa, in the same way grime precisely captured young London of the day. Drill down, and the cleverly deconstructed phrases echo familiar-sounding black music concepts – in this case, roots reggae – but as a whole it’s totally of its immediate environment, and utterly original. Lyrically, the song is a sharp focusing of the singer’s never-far-from-the-surface rage into a furious condemnation of an under-considered aspect of global black life. He addresses the ruling classes, arguing that it is they who have fomented any black anger, even crime, through colonial oppression. If Black Lives Matter organisers were looking for a theme song, they’d be hard pushed to find a better fit.Monsters You Made also has an in-song pairing we’re never likely to see again: 78-year-old Ghanaian feminist, political activist and playwright Ama Ata Aidoo and Coldplay’s Chris Martin. The former is in the shape of a snatch of TV interview about the damage done to Africa by colonialism, in which she rinses the host and hangs him out to dry the latter finds Gwyneth Paltrow’s ex-husband singing a chorus warning that there’s only so much people are going to take.This is Burna Boy distilled in a song. The Nigerian pop star, who in recent years has become Africa’s most successful, is smart, open-minded and unafraid in words and music. He knows that, in the age of the internet, global black music styles need to be embraced, not shied away from, and he’s willing to welcome most of them, providing they come in on his terms and know not to put their feet on the furniture.He’s confident enough to spring more surprises on top of the AidooMartin mashup. The album opens with a worryingly lengthy snatch of Pat Boone singing a song called Twice as Tall, taken from the 1959 movie Journey to the Centre of the Earth, and it’s assumed there’s irony involved – former rock’n’roller Boone is now best known for his rightwing politics. Then on the track Real Life, with the aid of a vocoder, he has Stormzy crooning in true R\u0026ampB style.Following on from African Giant, Twice as Tall positions African music in the 21st century by using contemporary sounds for traditional melodies and rhythms. It’s everything it should be to keep the purist happy, but subliminally familiar enough to make sense to the post-digital generation. This isn’t an easy act to balance, and contributes to Burna Boy’s wide appeal as much as his clever incorporations of such styles as R\u0026ampB, dancehall, roots reggae, hip hop and dub. These exist within the mixes as an idea: that you can revel in the particularities your own specific locale while also being part of a pan-global black culture.The result is songs that are intricate but still tricky, in the way African rhythms can be, but there’s a comforting palm wine-y warmth – regardless of his almost perpetual fury or often tedious boasting, Twice as Tall is usually more urbane than urban. And crucially, the singer is totally in tune with what his fellow millennials expect from their music and their cultural experiences – previous works have proved a vital touchstone for those of African heritage one or two generations removed from their motherlands.It’s with this in mind that his international approaches make the most sense. His grandfather was Fela Kuti’s first manager, and he appears to be following in that legend’s footsteps, as Fela grafted funk on to conventional Nigerian music to became the country’s biggest international superstar. Until Burna Boy that is. Twice as Tall was streamed more than 5m times during its first hour of release."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7846331dc2f6bb58103977616e8d432a75dca631/0_0_5345_3563/master/5345.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=971ff83a6940befd1dd60e6d6899a52d 480w","title":"a star is reborn dust cloud blamed for dimming of betelgeuse","story":"Mystery had enthralled skywatchers since the star began to lose luminosity last October – with some suggesting it could explodeThe sudden dimming of one of the Milky Way’s brightest stars, Betelgeuse, could be due to a dust cloud spewing up from its surface, astronomers have said.The mystery has enthralled skywatchers since the star – part of the Orion constellation – began to lose luminosity last October, with some experts suggesting it could herald its explosion into a supernova.But researchers working with the Hubble telescope now have a clearer picture, seeing superhot plasma being unleashed from the star’s surface, cooling in the outer layers of the atmosphere and eventually turning to dust.“The resulting cloud blocked light from about a quarter of the star’s surface,” the European Space Agency said in a statement, adding that the star has since returned to its normal brightness.“With Hubble, we see the material as it left the star’s visible surface and moved out through the atmosphere, before the dust formed that caused the star to appear to dim,” said lead researcher Andrea Dupree of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the United States.“We could see the effect of a dense, hot region in the southeast part of the star moving outward.”The researchers, due to publish their findings in The Astrophysical Journal, said they were not sure of the ultimate cause of the plasma eruption.Betelgeuse, almost 1,000 times the size of the Sun, is 725 light years from Earth, meaning the event witnessed by the telescope happened around the beginning of the 14th century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6269f8a5b9ce06cdcd699819e7ff3fc05b9e81a0/0_517_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dea92443c12df133d6fb1c70ada598f","title":"have you accessed a food bank in the uk for the first time coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the coronavirus pandemicAccording to figures from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in July, millions of people went hungry or relied on food bankds during the first few weeks of lockdown.We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the pandemic.How have you been coping and what was your experience like?

Those who had struggled to pay their rent, which they described as “sky high”, had fallen into arrears. Some of these issues were compounded during lockdown.Over the past four years, the families have campaigned – under the banner of People’s Empowerment Alliance for Custom House (Peach) – for social rent and to have repairs completed in a timely manner, staging protests and holding street parties while negotiating with the council.As well as charging social rent, the council will now respond to repair works needed in the homes, which have been used as temporary accommodation to house local homeless households. The residents said the exact rent reduction would depend on each property.Fayha Badi, 40, said the rent reduction would be life-changing for most families in the area. The 40-year-old mother of three, who is studying for a masters in biomedical science, said: “I never imagined I could win like this in the end.” Badi, who currently pays £356 a week for a three-bedroom property, will probably pay around £120 when the council takes back control. With the money she saves, she can finally take her children on holiday for the first time in five years.She added: “It’s all through being part of Peach and meeting all these kind people. When I think of them, I feel safe and confident.”Rokhsana Fiaz, Newham’s mayor, said: “This marks a real victory for the residents who have had historical issues with the management of the property by Mears, which I have been committed to address from the time I was a councillor in Custom House.“Since becoming the mayor of Newham in May 2018, officers have worked tremendously hard with residents to address these issues, by challenging Mears to meet their responsibilities and now we’ve come up with an acceptable solution which causes minimum disruption for tenants.”Mears said it had spent £400,000 annually on repairs to the properties, which were condemned for demolition by Newham council. The company said the rent levels in the blocks were set by the council.Alan Long, executive director of Mears, said: “First and foremost, I am deeply saddened that the residents of Customs House have been the victims of political indecision and electoral promises which could not have been delivered. I hope that Newham will now be able to start the much-needed regeneration of the area to develop the homes needed in their borough.“Whilst we are sad to be leaving our relationship with the tenants, I am thankful that this may be an opportunity for Newham to finally create new homes that the residents of Customs House deserve. Mears believes it has met its contractual obligations to residents and the council over the past nine years and have delivered the best service possible in the circumstances.”The properties will eventually be demolished and replaced as part of the regeneration scheme. The council announced plans that will allow current Mears tenants who have lived in the area for five years and were placed into their homes by the council to receive a secure social rent home. These plans are currently subject to cabinet approval.Boglárka Filler, 39, who lives in a two-bedroom property, said she finally felt hopeful about the future following Newham council’s announcement. “Since I’ve been a member of Peach, it’s helped me avoid a mental breakdown. Without them, I wouldn’t be here. If it wasn’t for Peach, I would not have any hope and I wouldn’t be able to participate in the community at all.” Filler, who has two children, hopes to return to her studies.“I’m still lost for words. It’s what we’ve been working for, it’s what we’ve been fighting for,” said Samantha Napa, 31, who works in the financial sector. “There’s been times where I just thought this is never going to happen, but the fact that it is actually happening, it hasn’t sunk in. It’s overwhelming.”Napa, who has lived in her current temporary accommodation in Custom House for seven years, urged others in a similar situation to come together and organise. “By coming together, by showing that we are united as one, they’ve had to listen to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7059b7fc2d74cdaf63581a66c807f89a9dc3394c/13_578_3762_2258/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bf9248084813913d02573699d8336c4","title":"harlequins sale premiership rugby restart","story":"English rugby is back, albeit with more of a clunk than a bang, but after five long months we must gratefully accept what we are given. Harlequins will not care that the rust from both sides was all too evident, nor that the penalty count kept good pace with the number of errors, and even Eddie Jones might have gone home happy with the mature performance of the home fly-half Marcus Smith.The 21-year-old scored 11 points from the boot but it was shrewd kicking to keep Sale penned in once Harlequins caught the eye in what was otherwise a disappointing spectacle – if the good news is that rugby is back then the better news is that it will surely get better as games come thick and fast over the coming weeks. Indeed, for Harlequins it is now alive with possibility and Sale, as disappointing as they were, will know they will significantly improve in matches to come. “Marcus is brave, he doesn’t shy away from the contact, he has worked hard on his defence in the last two months and he wants to be the best player in the world,” said Harlequins’ head of rugby, Paul Gustard. “He’s unashamed of his desire and ambition.”Diamond, too, acknowledged Smith “showed his class” while also lamenting Sale’s inability to adapt to the new breakdown interpretations, hinting at his frustration at how it was ruled on by referee Luke Pearce. “We didn’t get to grip with the breakdown interpretations, so we’re probably delighted to come away with a bonus point,” he said. “We need some clarity.”Before kick-off all eyes fell on both sets of players – Harlequins, united in taking a knee in support of Black Lives Matter, Sale opting to wear white T-shirts with the message “Rugby Against Racism”. Only four of their XV took a knee – Marland Yarde, Simon Hammersley, Sam Hill and Tom Curry and it was hard not to see that lack of cohesion manifesting itself on the pitch.For Sale, hotly tipped as title challengers in the buildup to the restart, conceded eight penalties in the opening 20 minutes. Smith was on target with the three he opted to shoot at goal and Harlequins – thrashed 48-10 in the reverse fixture – were 9-0 to the good. A knock-on from debutant Manu Tuilagi just before half-time, swiftly followed by a shocking missed penalty from Robert du Preez, only served to underline that Sale were not living up to the hype. Certainly Diamond, all the more audible in the absence of a crowd, did not think so.Byron McGuigan scored a well-worked try in the right-hand corner for Sale five minutes after half-time but a woeful crossfield kick inside his own 22 from Du Preez soon led to Scott Baldwin’s pushover try, Simon Hammersley sent to the sin-bin for infringing in the buildup. Du Preez was hooked immediately. His replacement, AJ MacGinty, pulled Sale back to 16-10 with nine minutes to go but, despite plenty of possession in the closing stages, the try was neither deserved nor forthcoming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10e59afc32c2c4e83102ab9eada83691bbf03b5c/0_178_4721_2832/master/4721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9da058f8cb49d5c714cd3dc13516082","title":"mercedes principal toto wolff undecided over future with f1 team","story":"The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has said his future with the team remains undecided and the conclusion he reaches may play a part in whether Lewis Hamilton continues competing in Formula One. Hamilton has yet to sign a new contract with Mercedes and has said he would be influenced by Wolff’s decision.Speaking before the Spanish Grand Prix, Wolff said he was considering various professional and personal factors in discussions with Ola Källenius, the chair of Daimler, Mercedes’ parent company. Wolff joined the team in 2013, the same year as Hamilton, and has since led them to six consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championship doubles.“I am in a moment of reflection where F1 is heading to,” he said. “What is happening with Covid and for personal reasons, too.

He has yet to begin negotiation for a new contract for beyond 2020 and Wolff believes he should continue racing for Mercedes.“Lewis staying is the best thing he can do and what he wants to do,” said Wolff. “He has the possibility of achieving great success, winning more races and hopefully championships and it is flattering that he says that his future is dependent on what I do. But he doesn’t need me. He has a great team there that will always support him.”Mercedes were on top in both practice sessions on Friday. Bottas led Hamilton in the morning and in the afternoon Hamilton took the top spot in front of his teammate. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was eight-tenths back in third in FP2.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

What we’ve never seen before is a president say, ‘I’m going to try to actively kneecap the postal service to encourage voting and I will be explicit about the reason I’m doing it.’”Obama added: “That’s sort of unheard of.”Voting by mail has become a politically charged issue, with Trump claiming that mail-in ballots will benefit his rival, the Democrat Joe Biden, and lead to fraud. Experts have confirmed that the mail-in ballot system has long been safe from any fraudulent tampering, with Trump and members of his family repeatedly using the methods themselves.Democrats have proposed $3.6bn in election funding to help states with vote processing, with another $25bn for the cash-strapped USPS to help it meet the expected demand from the 180 million voters who are registered to vote.But Trump has explicitly said he opposes these measures as he wants to deter mail-in voting.“If we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money,” the president told Fox Business on Thursday. “That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting. They just can’t have it.” Trump also repeated his claim, again with no evidence, that mail-in ballots would be “fraudulent”.Those remarks triggered widespread outrage, especially among Democrats and civil liberties groups.Trump’s critics have accused the president, who is badly trailing Biden in polling, of attempting to stymie the USPS to bolster his floundering re-election effort. Biden said the president’s latest comments were “pure Trump”. The presumptive Democratic nominee, who this week chose the California senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, added that Trump “doesn’t want an election”.The mounting concerns over the democratic process have been fueled by an apparent slowdown in activity by the USPS, which is headed by a Trump appointee. The USPS plans to remove hundreds of high-volume mail processing machines across the country, ostensibly due to a reduction in letters and packages sent during the pandemic.Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, has said that she fears “Republican sabotage of the USPS, including slowing mail delivery, is a Trump strategy to make voting by mail more difficult this fall”. Clinton urged voters to requests ballots early and send them in as soon as possible.The 300,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers said on Friday that the union’s executive council had endorsed Democrat Joe Biden for president, warning “the very survival” of the postal service was at stake.Trump, presiding over a disastrously handled pandemic that has ravaged the health of millions of Americans and plunged the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, has attempted to hurry along the reopening of schools and businesses, despite a surge in infections in many states, while attempting to paint Biden and Harris as an existential threat to the US.On Thursday, Trump lent credence to a false and racist conspiracy theory that Harris was not eligible to serve as vice-president, saying that he considered the allegation “very serious”. Harris, who would be the first black and Asian woman to be vice-president, was born in California and is able to serve in the role, or as president, under constitutional requirements.Trump previously aired the same “birther” conspiracy about Obama, the first black US president."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b1a5ef40178ce0e3276eba09d2b893167099ba9/0_169_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1639599e8c80ca1755e4cfd43a052f8f","title":"us postal service election q and a","story":"The United States Postal Service has emerged as a central issue in November’s hotly contested election where Democrat Joe Biden is seeking to prevent Republican Donald Trump from winning a second term. Here is why:Why is there so much attention around the USPS and America’s 2020 election?That surge means the USPS is going to play a much bigger role in facilitating an American presidential election than ever before. The agency will be responsible for transporting ballots between election officials and voters. Many states require ballots to arrive at election offices by the close of the polls on election day. Others allow ballot postmarked on or before election that arrive within a specified period. There’s concern over whether the USPS, which is already facing a severe financial crisis, will be able get ballots to voters and return them to election offices in time to have them counted.So what exactly is Trump doing to the USPS?Over the last few months there have been reports of severe mail delays across the US. In Philadelphia, for example, some residents told the Philadelphia Inquirer they had gone weeks without receiving mail. Concerns over those delays were heightened in early June when Louis DeJoy, a major Republican donor and Trump ally, took over as postmaster general, the top role at the USPS.In July, the Washington Post and other news organizations reported the agency was banning overtime and instructing postal workers to leave the mail behind if it delayed them on their routes. There are also reports of the USPS removing mail sorting machines from facilities, which could lead to a further slowdown.Critics suggest Trump and DeJoy are deliberately slowing the mail to make it more difficult to vote by mail. DeJoy has strongly denied any political interference. But on Thursday, Trump openly admitted he was blocking $25bn in proposed aid to the post office because he wanted to make it harder to vote by mail.The president is trailing Joe Biden in the polls and his focus on the USPS is widely seen as an attempt to sow chaos and to make it less likely people will have their votes counted in November. Vote-by-mail does not benefit one party over the other, but Trump has shown an instinctive belief that the fewer people who vote, the better his re-election chances will be.One of the top reasons ballots go uncounted is because they arrive at election offices past the deadline to be counted. Minorities, young people, and first-time voters are all disproportionately more likely to have their votes rejected.Will the USPS be able to survive Trump’s attacks for November?The post office says it has the capacity to deliver ballots this fall and says it will do so. The agency has longstanding guidance that voters should put their ballots in the mail before election day in order to have the best chance of having them counted. But many states allow voters to request a ballot within the seven days before an election, something USPS warned many states in recent weeks could mean voters not having their ballots counted.Does a mail-in vote have to be returned by the USPS?Many election officials are exploring setting up official drop boxes around their jurisdictions so that voters can return their ballots without having to return them in the mail. But in Pennsylvania the Trump campaign sued to block the use of drop boxes for the election, baselessly saying they will facilitate fraud.What can I do to help ensure there isn’t a USPS crisis in November?Experts are encouraging Americans to submit their requests for their November ballots now so that postal officials are less overwhelmed later this year and there isn’t a crunch to get them back in time. Voters should also look up the deadline for requesting and submitting an absentee ballot so they can do so well in advance of November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e88a1e4afdabb06e4a9adfb9c8fa6406944e2888/0_104_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfe1344acc5f314225d3cc7cbafbf8da","title":"covid 19 what can we do now lockdown restrictions have been eased in england","story":"Bowling alleys and soft play areas can reopen, but nightclubs remain closedThe government has announced a further loosening of coronavirus restrictions in England, which come into effect from Saturday 15 August. The changes were postponed from 1 August.The following businesses and activities can reopen in England, provided they follow Covid-19 secure guidelines:The changes only apply to England – the devolved authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own restrictions. Many activities, such as bowling alleys in Wales or close-contact facial treatments in Scotland, were already reopened in areas of the UK with lower coronavirus transmission rates than in England.The new rules in England also do not apply where local lockdowns are in place, which currently includes areas in the north of England, Leicester and Luton. You can check whether your area has local restrictions on the government website.The government says you are still NOT allowed to:Nightclubs, dance halls and sexual entertainment venues will remain closed.The advice, when you leave your home, is still to avoid being face-to-face with people from outside your household, to frequently wash your hands with soap and water, and to avoid crowded places.Government advice remains that it is important to maintain social distancing from people you do not live with. Single adult households – adults who live alone or with dependent children only – can form an exclusive support bubble with one other household. You should not change or add to your support bubble once formed.Face coverings are mandatory on public transport, in shops, museums, galleries, cinemas, places of worship and public libraries. There are some exemptions to the face covering rule, for example if you are a child under 11 or someone with a physical or mental disability that would make wearing a mask difficult.The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsphas warned.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”\u0026nbspThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Travel is permitted throughout the country, but you are advised to try to maintain social distancing as much as possible while doing so, especially in confined spaces such as a car.International travel is subject to restrictions. You must self-isolate for 14 days when you arrive in the UK, unless you have travelled from one of the countries where there are “travel corridors”.

Tehran’s foreign minister described the agreement as a “dagger … unjustly struck by the UAE in the backs of the Palestinian people and all Muslims”.As part of the US-brokered deal, the UAE claimed it won a concession for the Palestinians as Israel agreed to temporarily “suspend” its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank.However, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been clear he remains committed to annexation, and Palestinian leaders slammed the UAE deal as a betrayal that damaged their cause.The new alliance has broken the status quo in which Israel was mostly isolated by its neighbours as a pariah.Jordan, which with Egypt was the only other Arab state to have recognised Israel before Thursday’s announcement, issued a statement acknowledging the deal without praising it.The Jordanian ruler, King Abdullah II, has been a prominent critic of Netanyahu’s plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. Amman said more progress on the Palestinian issue was needed.While the Palestinian issue has been sidelined regionally, mutual hostility towards Iran shared by Israel and several Middle East states has been a critical factor in their budding relations in recent years. Meanwhile, Washington has attempted to gather a coalition of Israel and autocratic Arab leaders against Tehran and its allies.Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has said another Arab country is likely to establish ties with Israel in the coming days. Bahrain and Oman, which both welcomed the UAE move, are seen as likely candidates.Trump’s announcement on the UAE appeared to have blindsided the Palestinian leadership and their allies. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, suggested he had no forewarning of it.“The Palestinian leadership rejects and denounces the UAE, Israeli and US trilateral, surprising, announcement,” said his spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, adding that it was a betrayal of Jerusalem and the Palestinian cause.Elsewhere the deal has been widely welcomed, in large part because it was interpreted as halting annexation.The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, called the accord “hugely good news”. He said: “It was my profound hope that annexation did not go ahead in the West Bank, and today’s agreement to suspend those plans is a welcome step on the road to a more peaceful Middle East.”Even Trump’s opponent in November’s US election, Joe Biden, said the UAE’s move was “a welcome, brave, and badly needed act of statesmanship” that would help ensure Israel remains an “integral” part of the Middle East.“Annexation would be a body blow to the cause of peace, which is why I oppose it now and would oppose it as president,” Biden said.The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said annexation “would effectively close the door for a renewal of negotiations and destroy the prospect of a viable Palestinian state and the two-state solution”.Anshel Pfeffer, an Israeli journalist and author of a Netanyahu biography, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper that the Israeli leader had won a significant diplomatic coup while giving nothing to the Palestinians, previously seen as a requisite for regional acceptance.“It is an achievement for Netanyahu that his predecessors who were prepared to make major concessions to the Palestinians only dreamed of,” he said. “A generation of western diplomats who thought that Israel needs to pay in hard currency for any such breakthrough with the Arab world were tearing their hair out last night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8759aaa9ac0c708726aaf3f65d16bcc9830f4242/0_84_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f00f73a56761ad22aad5c4ff4916549","title":"second time unlucky covid restrictions derail japan pms holiday again","story":"Shinzo Abe had planned to visit family during O-bon holiday but political rival Tokyo mayor calls on capital’s residents to stay home Millions of people who have been forced to cancel holidays due to the coronavirus outbreak might struggle to sympathise, but Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is among those who have had to forego their summer break – and he has a political rival to blame.Abe, who has been criticised for his handling of a recent rise in Covid-19 infections, was reportedly due to return to his constituency in Yamaguchi prefecture this week as Japan began several days of public holidays.But he was forced to put his vacation on hold after the governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, called on residents not to leave the capital during the O-bon holiday, when people traditionally return to their home towns to visit family and pay their respects to their ancestors.Abe had planned to visit his family grave and attend a fireworks display, according to Jiji news agency.Japanese authorities do not have the legal powers to impose travel bans, but Abe would have drawn fresh criticism of his response to the outbreak had he taken a holiday when so many people have decided to stay at home.Abe had been planning to visit his holiday home in Yamanashi prefecture during a four-day weekend in July, only to cancel after Koike called on Tokyo’s 13.9 million residents to avoid non-essential travel outside the city amid a resurgence in cases.Koike, who has been tipped as a future prime minister, is “always interrupting” Abe’s holiday plans, Jiji quoted a prime ministerial aide as saying.It remains to be seen if Abe will go ahead with plans to visit his holiday home after Japan marks the 75th anniversary of its defeat in the second world war on Saturday.“The prime minister is exhausted by a barrage of criticism,” an aide told Jiji.An LDP lawmaker told the news agency that the sight of Abe, whose health has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, taking a “luxurious vacation” in the middle of a pandemic “could provoke a backlash from the people”.Japan has avoided the large number of deaths and cases seen in the US, Britain and other countries, but it is struggling to contain a rise in new infections in Tokyo and other areas since Abe lifted the state of emergency in late May.Tokyo reported 206 cases on Thursday, bringing its total to 16,680, according to public broadcaster NHK. Japan has so far reported a total of 53,315 Covid-19 cases and 1,090 deaths, it added. The figures include those connected to the Diamond Princess cruise liner, which was quarantined in Yokohama in February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd01054431cd5483bfdda3371dafe65c107a5706/0_101_3658_2195/master/3658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f7766733a9e491a742466df6e20c21e","title":"uk agrees deal 90m doses two potential coronavirus vaccines","story":"Government secures early access to those being developed by Novavax and JanssenThe UK has added a further 90m doses of coronavirus vaccine to its stockpile.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has announced that it has ordered 60m doses of a vaccine from the US biotech company Novavax, and 30m doses of another from the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, which is based in Belgium and owned by Johnson and Johnson.The addition of the two vaccines brings the country’s potential reserve to 340m doses across six experimental vaccines. The government has said both vaccines could be delivered to the UK by mid 2021 if they prove safe and successful in clinical trials.Like the Oxford vaccine, which is in phase three clinical trials, Janssen’s is an adenovirus vaccine, while Novavax’s is a protein adjuvant vaccine – the same approach as taken by GSKSanofi Pasteur, with whom the UK government has also placed an order for 60m doses. Members of the public can sign up to take part in clinical trials of the coronavirus vaccines.Early results from the six vaccines have been promising, but experts caution that more work is needed to show they offer effective protection against coronavirus infection.“It is very helpful to have a variety of vaccines, both because we do not know how many will either not work well or have serious adverse effects or will not give lasting protection or will not work well in particular groups like the elderly,” said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Kate Bingham, Chair of the UK Vaccine Task Force, told the  the government was aiming to secure enough doses of each vaccine to protect 30m people in the UK deemed “high priority”, such as frontline healthcare workers and older adults. For some vaccines that will mean securing 60m doses, as two doses are expected to be required per person, while for others a single dose is expected to be sufficient.“The reason we are spreading our bets across the different vaccine formats is because we don’t know which vaccine format is or could be proven to be successful,” she said. Bingham said that while the details for each contract differ, the government essentially pays a deposit upfront, with the remainder paid when the vaccine is approved and can be delivered.However Bingham said the sum spent so far on procuring vaccines remains confidential.Prof Beate Kampmann, the director of the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The government has now covered virtually all of the bases by buying into the technological platforms from which the various vaccine candidates are developed.“It’s hedging bets but provides options once we know which of these vaccines show the most promising safety and efficacy data from the ongoing trials – and hopefully it will be more than one. I hope they will also contribute effectively to the global initiative for access to Covid-19 vaccines as we do need to have vaccines for all and not just for the UK.”The government has also agreed in principle to co-fund the development of the Janssen vaccine, supporting the next phase of its clinical trials. It will also support a phase 3 clinical trial of the Novavax vaccine, at least part of which is expected to be manufactured in the UK.“The government’s strategy to build a portfolio of promising vaccine candidates will ensure we have the best chance possible of finding one that works,” said the business secretary, Alok Sharma. “Today’s agreements will not only benefit people in the UK, but will ensure fair and equitable access of a vaccine around the world, potentially protecting hundreds of millions of lives.”The latest developments come as an internal job advert seen by the Mirror reveals the government is seeking a head of pandemic preparedness, five months after the country first went into lockdown. The role will apparently include responsibility for helping officials review approaches to pandemic stockpiling.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This is not a brand new role. We have had an experienced pandemic preparedness team in place for many years who have covered these responsibilities across a number of different posts. This simply reflects an expansion and merging of different teams.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fea11d833c1e01243b916ba90a8735388abbb69/0_0_3478_2087/master/3478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b0bdf0e72c52229280363daa1d9998d","title":"welsh plans ease coronavirus rules allow extended families to meet","story":"Up to four households will be able to gather from 22 August if conditions remain stablePeople in Wales will be able to see more of their families and friends under plans to further ease coronavirus restrictions.Mark Drakeford, the first minister, said that should conditions remain stable over the next week then from 22 August, up to four households will be able to join together to form a single extended household.Up to 30 people will be able to attend a meal indoors after a wedding, civil partnership or funeral if social distancing can be maintained.The Welsh government will not be making any changes to the rules on people meeting indoors with people who are not part of their household or extended household.This means people should visit pubs, restaurants or other places indoors only with people from their household or extended household.Amendments to the regulations will come into force next week to make it obligatory for hospitality businesses and other high-risk settings to collect contact details of customers.Drakeford said: “Wales has come together to tackle the spread of this virus and the action we have taken together has made a real difference. The number of cases continue to fall and this means we will be able introduce new changes to allow up to four households to come together and form an extended household.“These are cautious, step-by-step changes. We are learning from what is happening across the UK and outbreaks are mainly linked to people meeting others inside the home. That is why it is so important we don’t invite people outside our extended households into our homes.”He added: “We have made so much progress and we mustn’t jeopardise this. That means we are not at a point where we should be visiting anyone’s home at any time.”He said it was vital to be able to respond quickly to any outbreaks. “Providing our contact details when attending these premises will mean people can be contacted quickly by our Test, Trace, Protect teams if they may have been exposed to coronavirus. Only by us all doing our part and taking personal responsibility for our actions can we continue to tackle the scourge of coronavirus.”The Welsh government recently strengthened local authorities’ powers to enforce the regulations. Enforcement officers can issue a premises improvement notice to highlight breaches and specify measures that need to be taken."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa23d45e4813e3a585bdc005e1d70e7860eb19b3/330_437_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e42e4095cf6cf4b631ee37fc71c130","title":"beirut explosion devastates sursock palace and museum in pictures","story":"Among the many homes and buildings damaged by the Beirut explosion were the Sursock Palace and Museum.

Photograph: CollinsProposals for the permanent pedestrianisation of several streets around Grafton Street have had an “overwhelmingly positive” response following trials in recent weeks, Dublin City Council has said.For the last three weekends, parts of South William Street, Drury Street, Dame Court, South Anne Street and Duke Street have been pedestrianised, with parking spaces turned into outdoor seating areas for cafes and restaurants.This weekend was to be the last weekend of the trial scheme, but the council said the scheme will continue for the remaining two weekends in August. There was clear desire for the measures to be made permanent, it added.“We have received 1,010 responses to our online survey on the trials and feedback remains overwhelmingly positive with over 90 per cent of respondents in favour of pedestrianising these streets on a permanent basis.”Footfall on Grafton Street and the surrounding area had fallen to 20 per cent of normal levels during the coronavirus lockdown. However, following the introduction of the pedestrianisation, footfall on the August bank holiday Saturday was higher this year than for the same Saturday in 2019, the council said.From this week, parking spaces in several locations will be retained for tables and chairs on a seven-day basis, the council said.Green Party councillor Michael Pidgeon said the reaction from businesses and the public to the trial was conclusive.“The principle of pedestrianisation of these streets has been settled without question,” he said.Some issues such as access for cyclists needed to be ironed out, but it was clear people found coming into town a “nicer experience” at the weekends. His fellow Green Party councillor Janet Horner said the trials had been invaluable in allaying any fears in relation to the pedestrianisation.To facilitate safe cycling routes to schools the council is also installing a 3.5km segregated cycle lane along Griffith Avenue from Ballygall Road in Glasnevin to Malahide Road in Marino.The route will act as a “main spine”, the council said, with extensions either side introduced over time to enable safe cycling to schools and colleges in the area, which includes Dublin City University. The route will include a contraflow cycle lane on the one-way section of Griffith Avenue at the Ballymun Road.Contraflow cycle lanes will also be installed in the city centre on Parnell Square East, to link O’Connell Street to North Frederick Street, and on Werburgh Street in Christchurch.Meanwhile, design work is continuing on the two-way cycle track for Strand Road in Sandymount, which will see the coastal road become one-way for cars."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Glamping under the StarsAs many local businesses in Laois, Kildare and Offaly closed their doors again last week due to coronavirus restrictions, one Laois business saw an opening to meet the needs of the local community.Glamping under the Stars, a boutique “glamp” site, is now providing local Laois residents with the opportunity to have a staycation without having to break any of the public health rules.The business initially closed on Friday, August 7th, when the coronavirus restrictions were reintroduced in the county, which owner Kyra Fingleton said “felt like the end of the world”.“It was sort of an organic thing that just came about because of how events occurred. Friday night myself and my husband were here tearing our hair out, trying to contact guests and it was all about refunds and losses,” she said.“Saturday morning from about 9 o’clock in the morning, the phone just rang and rang and rang with people from Laois saying ‘my holiday is cancelled, my kids are devastated, can I please come to you instead?’. There was such a volume of calls that I thought there has to be something in this. I don’t really see any logical reason why we couldn’t accommodate these people.”Ms Fingleton said she didn’t want to break any rules, and was worried that reopening might not be permitted.The local support has been “unprecedented”, as people opt to holiday in their own county, she said.“Within 24 hours, the full week and a half was booked out with local guests. I’ve got a waiting list now for Laois people, it’s unprecedented,” she said.“I’ve found that people have really enjoyed it and even people living virtually on our doorstep surprised themselves by how much the kids enjoyed it and will be back next year.”The site has six self-catering accommodation units, each of which have their own private bathroom facilities as well as barbecue facilities. There are two acres of wildflower meadow, with paths mown for children to explore.Ms Fingleton also provided each unit with their own chiminea stove and fire wood, since the communal campfire is not feasible under social distancing rules.“They still get the campfire under the stars experience and the kids still get to toast the marshmallows under the stars, but the social distancing is still in place,” she explained.Asked if the local demand is enough for the business to break even this year, Ms Fingleton said it all depends on what happens next.“When we had the two-week unexpected lockdown we thought we would have to close for that period but I suppose it’s great that we got bookings in from local people, so it has helped from a financial point of view.

Six people have since gone back into the house. Photograph Nick BradshawThe The majority of tenants who were evicted from a property they were renting in Phibsborough, north Dublin returned to the home on Thursday. Nine tenants, many of whom are foreign nationals, were removed from the Berkeley Road property on Wednesday morning. Several men wearing all black, face coverings, caps and sunglasses entered the house on Wednesday morning, instructed the tenants inside to leave and then boarded up the front door and windows. A number of gardaí attended the eviction and watched from the street outside the front door, as one of the tenants was physically removed from the property, according to video footage.The tenants spent several hours afterwards outside the house, with their belongings and bin bags full of clothes on the pavement. On Thursday, activists with the Dublin Central Housing Action group removed the boarding and allowed the tenants to re-enter the property. The housing group was previously involved in several high-profile occupations of vacant Dublin city properties in 2018, to protest the housing crisis. The tenants claim they had not been served written eviction notices to vacate the property prior to it being repossessed on Wednesday. Six of the tenants were back inside the property on Thursday. Upon re-entering the home tenants said significant damage had been caused inside the property, including windows, doors and toilets being broken, with bed mattresses in the house also removed. Gerry Ward, who had earlier been the tenant’s landlord, said he had been involved with the property since around 2004. He said there was a legal dispute over it since 2017 with a property fund, Beltany Property Finance.“That has not been finally resolved, that has not been fully resolved,” he said, adding he had not been aware of the property’s repossession until he was contacted by the tenants.ConfidentialityA spokesman for Goldman Sachs, which controls Beltany, said the fund had sold the property on June 2nd, but was unable to disclose the name of the buyer citing confidentiality reasons. One source said the property had been sold to a Dublin-based company. Two iniduals listed as directors of that company did not return requests for comment on Thursday.KBC Bank had owned the loan on the property previously, but sold it to Beltany around two years ago, a KBC spokeswoman said. A number of the housing activists assisted tenants in cleaning the property, as well as supplying new mattresses, installing a new toilet and replacing the front door on Thursday. Elias Niyi Adbo Jegede (47) is one of the tenants, who came to Ireland from Nigeria in 2005, and had been living in the home for several years. “What happened here is someone that has lived here for several years was evicted within 10 minutes . . . I don’t see how this is happening in Ireland,” he said. Speaking after tenants re-occupied the home on Thursday he said: “I am very grateful for the Irish people who have helped us.” The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) has written to Garda Commissioner Drew Harris querying the presence of gardaí at the eviction. The civil rights organisation stated gardaí should not be playing any supportive role in property evictions, unless it was in response to criminal behaviour. ‘Chaos’Another tenant, Theresa Chimamkpam (45), said she had been living in the house since 2011, and had not been served an eviction notice to vacate the home. “This is our home, in the middle of the pandemic you threw us on the road,” she said. Ms Chimamkpam said the property was in a “state of chaos” when the tenants returned on Thursday. Emergency accommodation was sourced for a number of the tenants on Wednesday night by a voluntary group, Inner City Helping Homeless.A Garda spokesman said legal representatives of the property’s owner attended Mountjoy Garda station on Wednesday, “to inform gardaí that they intended to secure their premises”. Gardaí “noted the proposed activity but did not attend the premises at the time”, he said. During the eviction a tenant made an emergency call to gardaí at 11am, and a number of units attended the scene, but “the majority were quickly stood down”, the spokesman said. “Subsequently a number of Garda personnel remained at the scene with the primary function to prevent breaches of the peace and ensure the safety of all persons involved,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330405.1597420738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tipperary mushroom plant suspends work as staff test positive for covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWalsh’s Mushrooms said that as a business ‘we have stringent measures in place to control Covid-19 since March and we have had no incidence of Covid-19 up to this point’.A mushroom plant in Co Tipperary has suspended operations after a number of workers tested positive for Covid-19.The plant confirmed that it had a single positive test in recent days, with more positive cases following testing of close contacts. It is understood the HSE is to embark on a wider testing programme of workers at the facility. Sources said eleven workers at Walsh’s mushrooms in Golden, near Cashel have tested positive from around 20 tests. While the overall number of cases is relatively low, the high percentage of positives has led to a decision to undertake more testing.In a statement, the plant said: “Operations are being suspended after a member of staff was diagnosed with Covid-19 while in self isolation. Subsequent testing of close contacts has resulted in further positive cases.”“As a business we have stringent measures in place to control Covid-19 since March and we have had no incidence of Covid-19 up to this point.”“We are working with the HSE and all relevant authorities assisting in contact tracing and testing of all staff.

Essential maintenance will continue at the facility.”“The safety, wellbeing and protection of our employees, their families and the local community is our number one priority.”Jackie Cahill, the local Fianna Fáil TD, said there were 150 people working at the plant. He described the development as “worrying”, and said he had been in contact with Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly throughout the day. “We have to get extensive and intensive testing of the workers and anyone in contact to minimise the spread of the virus and get it under control,” he said. “Everything is being done, the proper procedures have been put in place to find out the extent of the virus in the community and control the spread of the virus as much as possible,” he said.Labour leader and Tipperary TD Alan Kelly said the HSE had been in touch and are organising full testing facilities in the local village immediately. “It is important that all staff and related personnel are tested immediately and then close contacts are all traced and informed,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Covid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330170.1597392626!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus new zealand extends auckland lockdown by 12 days","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern at a press conference in Wellington, New Zealand, on Friday. Photograph: APNew Zealand’s government has extended the lockdown of its largest city, Auckland, for another 12 days as it tries to stamp out its first domestic coronavirus outbreak in more than three months.The outbreak has grown to 30 people and extended beyond Auckland for the first time.Until the cluster was discovered on Tuesday, New Zealand had gone 102 days without infections spreading in the community. The only known cases were travellers quarantined after arriving from abroad.Health authorities believe the virus must have been reintroduced from overseas, but genome testing has not found a link with any of the quarantined travellers.That has prompted authorities to investigate whether shipping workers were a source, after several employees at a food storage facility were infected.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said extending the Auckland lockdown, which began on Wednesday, would give authorities time to get a handle on the virus cluster and isolate those infected.“Together, we have got rid of Covid before,” she said in a highly anticipated address. “We have kept it out for 102 days, longer than any other country. We have been world-leading in our Covid response, with the result that many lives were saved and our economy was getting going faster than almost anywhere else. We can do all of that again.”All of the new cases in the outbreak appear to be linked through family or work connections.The only known infections outside Auckland are two people in the central North Island town of Tokoroa who were visited by infected family members from Auckland.Officials said they thought the chances were low that the virus would spread further there.Several of those infected work at an Americold food storage facility in the Auckland suburb of Mount Wellington.Officials are looking at the possibility that workers on a freight ship or at the port may have spread the infections, despite physical distancing requirements at those sites and orders preventing ship workers coming ashore.Director-general of health Ashley Bloomfield said rigorous testing is being carried out “as part of our investigation just to follow that chain of the Americold goods that might have come in through the port and been transported to that Mount Wellington depot”.Officials are also investigating the possibility that the virus could have survived from abroad on chilled or frozen food boxes and then infected workers in New Zealand, a scenario they consider unlikely.Mr Bloomfield said they completed a record of more than 15,000 tests on Thursday and they were getting a clearer picture of the outbreak’s contours.Health Minister Chris Hipkins said: “All of the cases so far, at this point, are connected. They are all part of one Auckland-based cluster. And that is good news.”The outbreak has cast doubt on whether New Zealand’s general election will go ahead as planned next month and has halted political campaigning.Ms Ardern said she would decide by Sunday on whether to delay the poll, which she can defer by up to about two months under New Zealand law.Opinion polls indicate that her Labour Party is likely to win a second term. – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Thursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

An unsanitary, untamed place with humans and wildlife packed in close quarters. The venue where a mystery virus can jump into the global population, creating devastating pandemics. The image of wet markets as disgusting and lawless – though a misperception – has already stuck. Calls have increased from around the world for China to shutter them to prevent a future outbreak. Such demands came after the coronavirus emerged at a seafood market in Wuhan, leading researchers to believe that a bug found in animals had mutated and jumped over to humans there.“I don’t think it’s necessary to close them – it’s a staple in daily life. But the sanitation regulations overall could be improved,” said Mrs Huang, 50, who has shopped at wet markets her whole life. Similar to what many in the West know as farmer’s markets, wet markets are typically rows of open-air stalls selling fresh meat, seafood, fruits and vegetables. They’re the place where many Chinese people visit to stock up on groceries. Some do sell and slaughter live animals, providing a fresh cut for the table. But exotic wildlife, like bats or civet cats, aren’t exactly common fare. Hu Tian, 30, is a fishmonger who peddled crabs and fish at the now-closed Wuhan market. He used to earn a living there to support his family of four. “I’ve sold goods in the market for more than 10 years, and I’ve never seen any bats,” he said. He now scrapes by via government subsidies.That’s not to say such animals aren’t being bred and traded. The Chinese government has pushed traditional remedies as part of a broader soft power campaign. Many of those herbal medicines use animal ingredients, such as bear bile, rhino horn and tiger bone. The rarer the remedy, the higher the price it sells for, an incentive for breeders to get in the game. Some looking to cut corners might engage in poor hygiene practices potentially dangerous to public health. As with many industries, regulating effectively is a challenge, even in an authoritarian state.Such nuance and distinction around China’s animal trade and its potential link to the Covid-19 pandemic has been completely lost as the world descended into emergency mode. A ergence in understanding about wet markets reflects a broader geopolitical ide that has occurred alongside the pandemic, with China and Western nations in many ways talking past each other. “Fracturing is a good word to describe where things are,” said Nadege Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research. “I would argue that it started a while ago, and the fracture was already visible, but not as deep and probably, there was still hope that ‘we can do things together.’”“The last few months seem to have proven us otherwise,” she said. “This pandemic has accelerated this trend it served as a catalyst.” This puts the world in a dangerous place. Less engagement overall “is going to make the quality of understanding the other side much worse, and that’s going to lead to many more miscalculations,” said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow who specialises in China at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. China’s handling of the pandemic – a heavy-handed response that included surveillance and suppression – made it clear to the world that the ruling Communist Party governed its country in a very different way to the West. On paper that had always been the case. But for many nations the coronavirus has highlighted the perils of dealing with an ever-powerful China driven by its own political motivations. It has prompted a rethink on engagement with Beijing, widening geopolitical fissures that were already in place. For years China seemed to accept that it had to play by rules set by the West in order to continue its rise. Now Beijing has indicated it wants to play by its own rules, and even have a say in setting them – brandishing its true colours in a way that can’t be ignored.Whether Beijing is successful in carving its own path – perhaps allowing other like-minded nations to follow suit – will shape global dynamics for years, perhaps decades, to come. As China grows ever more bold, the question is: Does Beijing even care what the West thinks any more?Before the pandemic, China was already at loggerheads with the US over trade. In Washington, there was talk of “decoupling” – essentially installing a firewall between the two countries as a way to protect America from the potential risk that came with the rise of China. Academics wondered whether the world was entering a “new Cold War.” None of this stopped Mrs Huang, part of China’s growing middle class, from saving funds to send her son, 20, to university in America to expose him to more ways of thinking. “In China, we look at issues from a single point of view, while in foreign countries, there are multiple perspectives taught,” she said. “To be a more open-minded person, you can’t just look at things your way.”Beijing was also embroiled in various diplomatic rows with countries including Australia, Canada and Sweden. In efforts to squeeze those nations, China acted boldly. Beijing arbitrarily detained two Canadians as retaliation after Ottawa arrested a Chinese tech executive during a layover in response to a US extradition request. There were mounting questions about the security threat of having Chinese companies involved in building key infrastructure, such as 5G mobile networks, or Chinese tech suppliers selling surveillance cameras and drones to national police forces. What would happen if the Chinese state compelled companies to give up data – a power inscribed in law? Then, pro-democracy protests roiling Hong Kong for months last year captured the world’s attention. Screens filled with images of riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators fighting against Beijing’s encroaching control. The youngest person arrested was 11. Calls from the UK and US grew, urging China to employ a lighter touch. Beijing, tired of being scolded by the West, appeared to get more aggressive, not less. This was the backdrop against which the world entered the pandemic. In retrospect, it marked the beginning of a grinding decline that risks permanently souring China’s relations with the West.China has long had global impact, climbing quickly to become the world’s second-largest economy, powered by low-cost manufacturing and exports. At home, the Chinese watched their country transform from rice paddies and industrial wasteland into megacities – Shanghai and Beijing both have more than 20 million people. Mrs Huang, who declined to give her real name, talked of old Beijing, before small lanes disappeared into highways. The Costa Coffee branch we met in was located in a shiny mall towering over what used to be a patch of overgrown dirt. Like others in her generation, she lived through the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 when the Chinese military opened fire on peaceful pro-democracy student demonstrators – an incident the government still refuses to acknowledge. The bet the ruling Communist Party made was that the country of 1.4 billion people would accept less social and political freedoms in exchange for continued economic growth and upward mobility. At least so far, that gamble has proven right.“Our lives really did improve for the better,” said Mrs Huang. “There are two reasons we tolerate the way things are here – one, the standard of living is always advancing and second, from a young age, we were taught that things could only be this way.” Outside of China, many people likely felt it first in their wallets, enjoying lower retail prices as the country became the world’s factory of choice – cheap labour, fast production. Then, over the last decade, students from China began to fill more and more spots in universities around the world. Chinese investors snapped up prime assets – the Cheesegrater in London, the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, Italian football club Inter Milan. Chinese shoppers, splashing their newfound wealth, boosted sales for luxury brands, like Louis Vuitton and Prada. But much of this was in the periphery, and didn’t touch the global population in a tangible way. That didn’t come until the coronavirus pandemic, when suddenly people encountered China in their living rooms.“It’s Covid that really stirred people up,” said Charles Parton, a former British diplomat who spent more than two decades working on greater China. The pandemic “brought the Chinese Communist Party into focus in people’s minds.”China’s cover-up and lack of transparency exacerbated the initial outbreak in Wuhan with unprecedented consequences. For weeks, Chinese authorities seeded complacency, telling the world there was no reason to worry. At the same time, whistleblowers – including doctors who noticed patients with strange illnesses – were detained, fined and reprimanded by police. Delays in reporting information occurred between the local and central government, and later, between Beijing and the world. Cases were discovered in other countries – Thailand, South Korea, Japan – for a full week before Chinese authorities admitted that human-to-human transmission was possible. Three days after announcing as such, the government locked down 11 million people in Wuhan. Hospitals didn’t have enough patient beds. Staff were so overwhelmed with coronavirus cases that pregnant women and cancer patients – even if they managed to obtain permission to travel during lockdowns – couldn’t get medical care.Evidence surfaced uncovering what appeared to be a far greater death rate than authorities had revealed. Pictures of corpses piled high circulated online briefly, before being deleted by government censors. But Beijing continued reassuring that all was under control. Early missteps were a direct consequence of how things run under the ruling Chinese Communist Party. And for the first time, repercussions due to the inner workings of the Party hit the world in a deeply personal way. The Party values stability above all, a characteristic leaders believe will allow them to stay in power, and avoid being dismantled, like the Soviet Union. What that translates to on the ground is an impulse to give the impression that everything is normal. Suppression of information is common – anyone challenging authority is squashed, and lower level cadres, whose promotions are linked to hitting at times impossible targets, are hesitant to report unsavory information up the chain.Chinese authorities would never allow anything to sully its image in the eyes of its people – fed a steady propaganda diet about how the Party, at the core of life, knows best. An educated class in China, like Mrs Huang – who works for a startup tech firm – is aware the authorities made mistakes, despite the government’s efforts to rewrite the narrative. She thinks they should be held accountable, but acknowledges there are no avenues to do so. What worries her more is that international backlash against the Party’s errors will spill over onto regular people like herself, and her son. “I really do think there were issues at the start of the pandemic, but the government is separate from the people,” said Mrs Huang. “I don’t know if regular Americans can avoid conflating the two.”Even in Wuhan, ground zero of the pandemic, people doubt the government’s version of events. “Ordinary people like us will never know the truth,” Long Menglei, 30, told me in April as lockdowns began lifting in the city. Her mother-in-law was severely ill with the virus for weeks. But it’s much easier to keep your head down, as government suppression never lets up.When infections began to fall and China crowed of containment success to the world, police continued to punish thousands of people for sharing information about the coronavirus online. Those trying to file lawsuits and seek reparations for deceased relatives have been harassed and intimidated by police, causing most to drop proceedings. Government control has extended into the afterlife, as grieving families haven’t been allowed to visit cemeteries.They may never be allowed to freely pay respects authorities still don’t allow families to remember those who died in the Tiananmen massacre, and from natural disasters, like the 2008 Sichuan earthquake – the ruling Party is always wary of groups gathering and griping about the government. It’s all so sensitive that a phalanx of police, minders and officials surrounded myself and a colleague when we visited a Wuhan cemetery to investigate, detaining and physically assaulting us, and harassing our driver. So it’s no surprise many feel resigned to whatever the government says is the truth. “I think we should believe the government,” said Mr Zhang, 40, a tech worker in Wuhan who was enjoying sunshine for the first time after 70 days indoors when we met. “There is no other possibility.” As the first country to discover infections, China was also the first to see cases subside.Authorities gloated about turning the corner and publicised a far-fetched origin story – that the US military had brought the coronavirus to China. Beijing was trying to deflect blame over its mishandling of the outbreak by redirecting public discontent toward stories of the country emerging victorious in what leader Xi Jinping called the “people’s war” against the coronavirus. Peddling this nationalist sentiment was an easy sell while the rest of the world remained in chaos. The government spied a chance to use global disruption to its advantage. “It is possible to turn the crisis into an opportunity – to increase the trust and the dependence on all countries around the world of ‘Made in China,’” said Han Jian, a director at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government think tank, in March. To that end, China began exporting medical materials and bragging about helping the world. Chinese state media conflated purchases of supplies by foreign nations with donated aid. “This boasting propaganda, which was of course aimed at the Chinese people although it’s conducted externally, enables them to say to the Chinese people, ‘Look at what we’re doing in the world China is leading the fight,’” said Mr Parton, now senior associate fellow at RUSI, a think tank.“This was, frankly, resented,” he said. “The Party is legitimising itself with its people, but at the same time, it mightily upsets the foreigners.” Some of the equipment that arrived was defective – inaccurate testing kits were sent to Spain, ventilators that couldn’t be sanitised properly were sold to the UK, and masks exported to the Netherlands didn’t meet required standards.Nations felt slighted, especially as many had sent supplies to China earlier in the year. Plus, global shortages existed partly because Beijing had hoarded equipment, instructing employees of state-owned enterprises to bulk-buy face masks and mail them home. There was little to be done – before the pandemic, China provided 40 per cent of the world’s imports of face shields, protective garments, gloves and goggles, according to PIIE. After ramping up production, China was making more than 100 million masks a day, 12 times more than prior to the outbreak. Countries that needed medical gear had no choice but to import from China.China had always trusted that such trade reliance meant countries would tread lightly but the pandemic highlighted the dangers of nations outsourcing key manufacturing to a country they couldn’t quite trust. This prompted deeper thinking on longstanding security concerns about Chinese involvement onshore in other areas.Halfway through 2020, the geopolitical ide is more evident than ever.The US and China are barreling down a rocky path. Relations have hit a new low after clashes over trade, technology, coronavirus, human rights concerns, Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, and its recent imposition of a draconian national security law in Hong Kong. The UK has reversed its decision on allowing Chinese telecoms firm Huawei a role in building the nation’s 5G networks over security concerns. London’s offer to allow three million Hong Kong people a pathway to British citizenship has further angered Beijing. Beijing is “very surprised by the outcome,” said Kitty Smyth, founder of Jingpinou, a UK consultancy specialising in China. “They’re genuinely shocked that Britain would choose to remain with a struggling America, rather than go forward with a rising China.” Even Switzerland – known for neutrality in its foreign policy – has asserted its stance. In early August, Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis said that China’s “human rights violations are on the increase.”“We are seeing China stray from the path of openness,” he said. “This means that Switzerland, too, must defend its interests and values more robustly.”The Chinese “haven’t experienced pressure this intense from foreign governments for several years, if not decades,” said Ms Smyth. But China has steadily increased its swagger to defy the West, ramping up territorial disputes on land and at sea this year. In June, skirmishes broke out along the high-altitude border to India, leading to casualties. Chinese maritime activity has increased in the disputed South and East China Seas, where Beijing and many Southeast Asian countries lay claim to the resource-rich waters. China has also buzzed fighter jets over Taiwan, a democratically-governed island with its own military, currency, passport and foreign policy that Beijing considers a renegade province. Beijing has encouraged Chinese in Australia to return home, or at the very least remain vigilant, citing a rise in racism. The government has warned its people away from the US over discrimination. That swagger has also been deployed at home, with authorities crowing that invasive contact tracing tools contributed to containment success – justification for more draconian surveillance in what is already the world’s most intense digital police state.Facial recognition thermal checks and apps that track people’s movements are now the norm. Those under home quarantine have had cameras and sensors placed at their doors to ensure compliance. “This will absolutely continue,” said Mrs Huang. Surveillance and contact tracing apps “have been so successful, why would they stop using them?“I can’t do anything about it, and you can’t refuse to use them,” she said. “There’s no such thing as privacy here.” Such surveillance could quickly proliferate in countries with leaders who want to emulate China’s brand of authoritarian capitalism. China has also exported related technology around the world – facial recognition programs, surveillance cameras – including to the UK.More aggressive behaviour signals China is happy to disengage – at least with some of the world. Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming has threatened that Britain “will pay the price” after the Government reversed on Huawei. Chinese state media vowed “public and painful retaliation,” saying Beijing may not sit for post-Brexit trade talks. British businesses including HSBC, Burberry and Jaguar Land Rover have been named targets for consumer boycotts – a move that has before been hugely damaging for foreign brands amidst diplomatic spats.But “China is not going to become a hermit kingdom,” said Ms Rolland, who sees Beijing as “asserting its own influence, authority and power...over the non-Western and developing world, rather than Western, advanced industrial democracies.” The ide, she thinks, will fall along “a difference of systems and models that are based on very fundamentally different values.” The outlines of different bubbles of influence are emerging, especially as countries face off in the global vaccine race. The US and China have “pushed ethno-nationalist rhetoric toward science and technology as a way to boost national competitiveness, national interest,” said Yangyang Cheng, a particle physicist and postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University. China has long seen STEM fields as tools of national greatness, and pre-pandemic, was already investing significantly in these areas, including biomedicine and high-end medical devices. Plans are afoot to build 30 high-grade biosafety laboratories over the next five years.The coronavirus has bolstered China’s desire to grow stronger in science. Success could help Beijing deflect widespread anger over its cover-up of the pandemic, and buoy its coronavirus-ravaged economy. Beating the West in the vaccine race might even be the ultimate sign that China has become so self-sufficient that it no longer needs to play nice with the US and the UK. It would also arm China with a tool to exert greater influence – a way to build diplomatic ties. Indeed Beijing has vowed “to give priority” to the Philippines if it develops a vaccine. Canada, on the other hand, is still waiting for vaccine doses to arrive from China after agreeing to partner in clinical trials the shipment remains stalled in customs.From a public health perspective, looking at vaccines as a way to profit is “to the collective detriment of our species,” said Ms Cheng. “That is a dangerous and really unfortunate attitude, because vaccine development and biomedical research in general should not be seen as a race,” she said. “Whatever is developed should be a public good it shouldn’t be something incentivised by financial interest or geopolitical calculations.” In China, propaganda and patriotic education are in overdrive, painting the West as the enemy. The sense is: “It’s really a hostile world out there, and we – as in the Chinese people – have to rely on ourselves,” said Ms Cheng. That nationalist sentiment resonates with most Chinese, who are proud to hail from a country that has, in their eyes, overcome all odds to yet again become a world leader – despite having been humiliated in the past by foreign powers.Beijing, tired of kowtowing to the West, is now puffing its chest with a new “wolf warrior” style of diplomacy – referring to a series of patriotic action films where the hero defends Chinese interests at home and abroad. But the idea that China and its people must band together to do battle with the enemy West hasn’t necessarily worked on everyone. Chinese with higher socioeconomic standing, like Mrs Huang, are often far more likely to believe the government is moving backwards. She admires the West’s democratic freedoms, and shakes her head disapprovingly when asked to assess the government’s virus response and whether she thinks leader Xi is taking the country in the right direction. But surveillance and suppression of dissent is so common that she doesn’t dare say his name out loud.Her family is considering immigrating to the US, though she worries whether they’d fit in as geopolitical fissures widen: “I wonder, would Americans still welcome me?”Experts hope the cracks appearing between China and the West will be temporary. Beijing has indicated interest in continuing to work together, though on its own terms. “It’s really tragic...this pandemic should have made people less narrow-minded, less nationalistic, because what it has taught us is that nations and human bodies are all porous entities,” said Ms Cheng. Determining and agreeing to new rules of engagement will be difficult. Mid-sized countries, like the UK, are “trying to find their own path in dealing with that overarching rivalry between the US and China, between these two,” said Ms Rolland. “It’s going to get a lot more complicated with European countries, because their whole model rests on the same basis and fundamental values as the Americans, rather than China.”“The worst case scenario is not a cold war,” said Mr Chorzempa. “It’s something much worse, much more confrontational.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"a levels fiasco proves no substitute real exams","story":"There is usually some sort of system for gaming an exam. If it’s history, a student can strategise by covering one or two historical debates on the bare minimum number of topics and twist the material to fit a question. For Shakespeare, certain quotes are applicable to almost any question likely to come up. If it’s maths, it’s harder, but questions can often be sorted into one of several categories that repeat themselves, even if the format changes.This is the sort of gaming students are meant to spend time on. This year, however, there was another way to increase the chance of success. Study a niche subject in a small class at a small, high-performing school, impress the teacher in the first term and then take a long holiday. This strategy would have been most effective in music or German, where the proportion of AA* grades given out this week soared by 15-17 per cent compared to last year. For those studying maths or English, however, Ofqual’s magic eight ball, known officially as “the standardisation process”, had the data to ensure this could not happen. There was no rise in the percentage of AA*s in these subjects.Despite the fury, the debacle over A-Level results may be one of the less damaging educational events in the lives of this year’s school leavers. Our universities, desperate for cash and bereft of foreign student fees, have extended a record number of offers to British students. So most of them are likely to be more concretely affected by missing four months’ education and suffering social distancing rules at university than by downgrades to some imaginary exam results. The debacle does highlight a salient truth, however: exams work and despite years of educational culture wars about them, there is no better alternative.That is not the message that teaching unions are taking from this mess. Some union leaders were pleased when national exams were cancelled in the spring. The National Education Union suggested, opportunistically, that it was time to “open up a longer-term conversation about the impact on our pupils of unnecessary high-stakes exams”, because “exams are not the way to assess someone’s ability”. The head of NASUWT, Patrick Roach, suggested “there are lessons from this crisis”, namely that teacher-awarded grades ought to play a bigger role in assessing pupils and exams should be reduced in importance. Tempting fate, the NEU even went as far as to claim: “Teacher assessment is just as reliable and stable.”The data, alas, now proves otherwise. The Government agency in charge, Ofqual, reported this week that if it had not applied an algorithm to adjust grades awarded by teachers, the proportion of A-Levels achieving an A or A* would have shot up by an unprecedented 12.5 per cent compared to last year. With adjustment, it has risen 2.4 per cent instead. Teachers interviewed by Ofqual admitted that they were giving pupils the benefit of the doubt and imagining how they would perform on “a good day”. This is human nature. It’s kind-hearted and inevitable – but it’s not very “reliable” or “stable”.Beyond the aggregate effect, there is ample evidence that teachers, like most of us, harbour biases that affect their pupil assessments. The Education Policy Institute highlights three studies suggesting that, when they assess ability or predict exam grades, teachers systematically stereotype their pupils based on ethnicity, socio-economic status, gender, their native language and their special needs status. There are nuances to the stereotyping, too. Pupils from more well-off families tend to be judged less harshly than their poorer peers, but all groups can be affected. If you look just at over-achievers getting the top grades, teachers systematically predict worse grades than they go on to achieve. The effect is especially marked for those from deprived backgrounds.It is no wonder that the Government felt it ought to avoid relying wholly on teacher assessments. In swerving that bear trap, however, it has fallen into an even bigger one. The algorithm Ofqual used tries to protect faith in the exam system by undoing teachers’ over-optimism and adjusting grades according to how well a pupil’s school has tended to perform in the past. So the performance of past cohorts affects the results gained by the class of 2020, however hard the students or their teachers have worked since then.Ofqual claims that the effect is the same for all pupils regardless of their socio-economic background, but the process also attempts to avoid skewing results unfairly by relying on historic data from extremely small class sizes. Hence, the fewer students there are in a class, the less their grades have been subjected to the voodoo of this “standardisation process”. The effect, naturally, is to favour those studying niche subjects in small groups, a feature more common to private schools than to big sixth-form colleges.But the algorithmic approach has an even bigger problem. It prioritises protecting the integrity of the grading system over the right of each pupil to be assessed as an inidual. It does nothing to adjust for the unconscious bigotry of teachers’ expectations and instead adds another layer of hard-wired bigotry on top based on how your school has ranked in the past. So if you come from a bad school and a bad home, you get hit twice.This, in a nutshell, is why we have exams. It is not because they are some sort of definitive evaluation of a person. There is more to character and intellect than taking a test on a certain day. But policymakers have yet to devise a better way to strip prejudice and cheating out of the grading system. There is one test everyone takes it and they are all marked blind by examiners who don’t even know their names. Tests can be brutal, but their blindness to personality and circumstance are part of what makes them fair. Some minds may be more or less suited to them, but almost everyone can improve their results through effort. Just like CV-blind job applications and fitness tests, exams work.Teachers, parents and pupils love to criticise tests for being stressful and reductive. Perhaps it takes a shambles like this one to show that, whatever their flaws and limitations, they are an awful lot fairer than the alternatives. If there is any “lesson” to come out of this fiasco, it should be that we learn to value exams more, not less.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british holidaymakers turn private jets scramble get home france","story":"When thousands of British tourists decided to head to France for a relaxing post lockdown holiday, they were not expecting to all have to leave at once. Such was the scramble to get back across the Channel that private jet companies reported a trebling in requests - including, one firm claimed, from teachers worried about being stuck in quarantine for the start of the new term. Brides-to-be, families and students made up some of the 160,000 tourists that were forced to attempt to make a hasty dash over the border. And even for those not hiring their own jets, it proved expensive after the demand for flights, trains and Eurotunnel tickets soared as Britons went to desperate lengths to get home before the new measures came into place. The news forced Kate, an events organiser from Croydon, south London, to cancel her wedding in Marseille, where she was due to get married on September 12, because the restrictions have made it impossible for friends and family in the UK to fly over to France.For us it is not just about the money we have paid, but all of our guests have hotels that won\u0027t be refunded now.Those who travelled back to the UK by water faced a race against time. The ferry operator Stena Line was desperately trying to get confirmation from the Border Force and the Foreign Office that its passengers would be exempt from quarantine. The boat is meant to leave at 10pm from Hook of Holland in Rotterdam to Harwich, where it was due to arrive at 6.30am tomorrow morning. However, the ferry is due to be in UK waters by 4am, the time the quarantine rule entered into force. Thousands of others made the unexpected journey back to the UK via the Eurostar, which sold out of capacity on its last three trains on Friday a matter of hours after the Government’s announcement. Stuart and Anna Buntine, a couple who own a farm in the Midlands, spent nearly £1,000 to make it home via the Eurostar from France to London’s St Pancras Station.Mr Buntine, 58, said: We didn\u0027t get our notification until this morning, where we were staying in Burgundy there wasn\u0027t a lot of internet.I went to bed last night thinking it was all okay, woke up at 7am to find we had to get back here pretty sharpish.We couldn\u0027t get tickets, all the sites had crashed. “We had to buy business class tickets back today so it cost nearly £1,000.”Ashley Bateson, 54, Katarina Bateson, 52, from south west London, also arrived in France on Thursday just hours before the Government announced it would be added to the coronavirus red-list. The couple, who were meant to return from Paris on Monday, described efforts to purchase last-minute tickets online as “mayhem”.Those who chose to fly were faced with price increases of up to 1000 per cent. Private jet provider PrivateFly reported three times the number of enquiries and bookings for flights out of France and other countries including the Netherlands that were added to the UK’s quarantine list on Saturday.Its chief executive Adam Twidell said that the increase in demand was “instant”, and that new and existing customers wanted to change their flight plans as soon as the announcement was made.“A typical emergency flight might be for a footballer who has missed the airline and needs to get to training, but now we’re seeing the same inquiries from teachers realising they need to get back in a week’s time to start school, and headmasters are not going to appreciate if they’re stuck in quarantine,” he said. Mark Barnes, a preparatory school teacher from Isleworth, west London was holidaying with his wife and two young children, aged six and eight, in Dijon, France, but bagged a seat on a flight back from Paris so he can go back to work on August 26.I have got to get back to school. I would have to isolate for 14 days if I left it any later which would be a pain,” Mr Barnes, 51, said after arriving into London Gatwick.Ben Hillman, 42, who presents the TV show A Place in the Sun on Channel 4, was forced to cancel a two week road trip across France with his wife Gabby, 40, and their two daughters Honor, four, and Hope, five. We don\u0027t have the luxury of going on the holiday as the girls start school two days after we were due to get back,” he said. “For our youngest, Honor, it is going to be her first year of school and that settling week is so important for her.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle criticises toxic media says happy home","story":"Meghan Markle has revealed she is “happy to be home” after a long absence from the US, saying she was ready to use her voice in a way she had “not been able to of late.”The Duchess of Sussex, in her first sit-down interview since returning to her native California in March, also took a swipe at toxic media, which she said had lost the public\u0027s trust.She told Emily Ramshaw, founder of The 19th* News, a Texas-based nonprofit news organisation which launched earlier this year, that after spending years in Canada filming TV series Suits and subsequent time in the UK she felt she had returned to a different America.To come back and to just see this state of affairs, I think at the onset, if I\u0027m being honest, it was just devastating. It was so sad to see where our country was in that moment, the Duchess, 39, replied when asked by Ms Ramshaw in a virtual summit about her “experiences as a biracial woman and mother” coming home to a troubled nation. “From my standpoint, it’s not new to see this undercurrent of racism and certainly unconscious bias, but I think to see the changes that are being made right now is really — it’s something I look forward to being a part of,” she said on Friday. “And being part of using my voice in a way that I haven’t been able to of late. So, yeah, it’s good to be home.”Several months after the Duchess returned, the country erupted in anti-racism protests following the killing of George Floyd by a white Minnesota police officer.After stepping down from their royal roles earlier this year, Meghan and Prince Harry moved to California with one-year-old son, Archie.It was reported this week that the couple has bought a $15million (£11m) home in Montecito, Santa Barbara County, suggesting they were settling down in the US.The Duchess, who recently revealed that she plans to vote in the upcoming US presidential election, also spoke about the importance of voting.We need to be really aware and not take (our vote) for granted. My husband for example — he\u0027s never been able to vote, she said, in what was seen as a slight to the Royal family. The right to vote is not a privilege it’s a right in itself.The Duchess, speaking with uncharacteristic candour, went on to criticise a lack of “non-partisan” journalism, saying she and the Duke routinely point to an “economy of attention” in the media that rewards the salacious over the truthful.“What’s so fascinating, at least from my standpoint and my personal experience the past couple of years, is that the headline alone, the clickbait alone, makes an imprint,” she said. There is so much toxicity out there.The Duchess is currently involved in a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers in the UK, which published the contents of a letter she sent to her father. She has previously criticised her treatment by the British tabloids.She went on: “You wanna have trust in journalism, have trust in what you’re reading. We have become so sadly comfortable that we’re getting all this stuff and it becomes noise as opposed to truth and accurate journalism.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second wave looms france reports 12000 new coronavirus cases","story":"France reported more than 12,300 new coronavirus cases this week as the infection rate rose to its highest in more than two months, sparking fears of a deadly second wave.Young people have been blamed for failing to maintain social distancing and not wearing masks, perhaps because many think they will not fall seriously ill if they catch Covid-19.Infections are increasing fastest among people under 45, with a 45 per cent increase in the 15-44 age group, compared with 20 per cent for people aged 45 to 64, and five per cent among those aged 65 to 74, according to the public health authorities.The health minister, Olivier Véran, said: “Young people keen to socialise after the isolation of lockdown have often failed to maintain social distancing or wear masks, and I can well understand how they feel.However, it’s not just them. When family or groups of friends who know each well have met up after not seeing each other for a long time, many have forgotten the need to keep their distance, not shake hands or kiss on the cheek. I cannot over-emphasise that it is imperative for everyone to keep following the rules.”The gradual easing of France’s strict lockdown from May 11 triggered a feeling of over-confidence, Mr Véran said. Beach parties and revellers packing into crowded bars set off local surges of infections, especially on the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, and several big cities.Paris and Marseille are now on the French authorities\u0027 high-risk “red” list and Britain has re-imposed a two-week quarantine on travellers arriving from France from Saturday.If the surge in infections continues, Jean Castex, the prime minister, has warned that France could be forced into a second lockdown which it could ill afford.The government is renewing appeals for people to observe social distancing and wear masks. Masks are compulsory in indoor public spaces throughout France, and most cities, including Paris and Marseille, have now made them obligatory in the most crowded outdoor areas.Some doctors have suggested that the rise in cases is misleading because France has ramped up testing. Of the roughly 3.5 million tests carried out in the country since the start of the epidemic, some 2.5 million were done in June and July alone. In May, only hospital patients were tested. Now, anyone can get a free test, even without a prescription. However, Mr Véran stressed that increased testing did not explain the surge. “This is a real increase, the signs are worrying and cannot be attributed to testing alone,” he said.France now has more than 330 clusters of infection, more than 30 of which were detected in the past two days. About half of the clusters have been linked with workplaces, according to a report by the Public Health Directorate.This suggests that many infections are being transmitted in factories or offices. A smaller proportion of French people are working from home than in the UK.About a third of the clusters have been linked with public or private gatherings, especially “extended family get-togethers,” according to the report.The number of coronavirus patients in French hospitals is creeping up and now stands at 4,864, including 374 in intensive care. More than two-thirds of intensive care patients are on the Riviera, in the Paris area, in northern France and in French Guiana, which borders Brazil.Pascal Crépey, an epidemiologist at one of France’s largest public health colleges in the western city of Rennes, said: “It is undeniable that the situation is becoming gloomier, but it isn’t dramatic yet. We are better equipped now than we were in March to monitor the epidemic and act in consequence.”   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/14/01/pri161085530.jpg","title":"arts entertainment furlough scheme extend government jobs","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Just 29 per cent of sector\u0027s furloughed staff have returned to work, with many venues still closedThe arts and entertainment sectors face significant job losses unless the furlough scheme is extended, the government has been warned.Just 29 per cent of furloughed employees in arts and entertainment have gone back to work so far, according to research by the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA).By contrast, 60 per cent of workers in the job retention scheme in hospitality industry have returned to work, while in construction and retail the figure is 70 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMany venues such as theatres, cinemas and nightclubs, as well as gyms and leisure centres, remain closed.

People on social media were quick to praise Parton for speaking out.“Between Dolly Parton’s quiet Covid research fund, BLM support, and her sending generations of children books through the USPS, at 74, she continues to be one of the most relevant and ever timely people of every era,” wrote one Twitter user.Parton was also described as a “national treasure,” and an “American treasure”, while someone else described Parton as “one incredible American”.Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote: “Me: I couldn’t love @DollyParton more.

They are now not able to get the game in the same way as they did before – and if the dispute continues and takes in more companies, other apps and platforms could be affected too.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe problem began when Fortnite began offering two ways of spending money in-game: either you could do so through the app store, and pay the full price, or you could do so by cutting out Apple and Google\u0027s payment system entirely, and developers Epic Games would give you a discount, equivalent to the fee normally taken from the store.Such a move is forbidden on both app stores. Apple and Google both stipulate that purchases of this kind must go through the app store, and developers pay a 30 per cent cut on those.Can people still get Fortnite despite it being banned from app stores?Soon after, Fortnite began to disappear from app stores. First, Apple removed it, and Epic Games sued then Google did the same, and the developers did the same too.The games are still available in some form: if it has already been downloaded on an iPhone, or through other app stores on Google. But the decision means that probably the biggest game in the world is no longer available on perhaps the two biggest computing platforms in the world.It is fairly clear that Epic Games knew its update would force Apple and Google to remove the app. And it is already trying to leverage the frustration of fans who are now unable to get hold of it, using the hashtag FreeFortnite and encouraging them to make their frustrations known.Apple and Google both argue that buying through the app store is safer and easier, both for developers and customers. By allowing the two large companies to manage the transactions, customers can check out without having to know their credit card details and being sure that their transaction is safe, and developers don\u0027t need to set themselves up with payment systems or handle complicated issues such as foreign exchange conversions they argue that the 30 per cent cut helps pay for the payment systems, security checks, marketing fees and other costs associated with running the platform.What\u0027s more, Apple and Google make the operating system and run the app stores that take users to those games. The companies presumably believe they should be compensated for that.That this represents an unfair stranglehold on customers and Epic Games themselves, and that they are taking a step to limit the power of the platform owners. It said in its legal filing against Apple, for instance, that the company had become a behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation.They are not alone in this, at all. In recent months, questions have begun to be asked by both regulators and other companies who use the app store about whether Apple, Google and other platform companies are abusing their dominance of those platforms, arguing that it is not fair to customers that they have no choice about where their software comes from, and it is not fair that developers have to pay up for access to their own customers.It is very difficult to say: Google, Apple and Epic games are three of the biggest companies in the world, and they have fallen out over a problem with two of the most powerful platforms in the world. What\u0027s more, there\u0027s no obvious compromise position, since Apple and Google must either relent on the fees, either for Epic or for everyone, or miss out on having Fortnite in their stores.Previous disputes of this kind have led to a compromise in the end. When a much smaller email app called Hey complained that it was unfair that it could not encourage people to sign up and pay through its own systems, for instance, it came upon a solution with Apple wherein it would offer a free trial to iPhone users that could be later upgraded, in what appeared to be a decision specifically calculated so that everyone could save face.It is not clear how everyone could save face in this situation. The scale of the dispute and its zero-sum nature means that someone, presumably, is going to lose.Apple could relent and allow Epic Games specifically to either pay less of a fee, or none at all, for instance. Or it could undertake a more profound change that might also get it out of trouble with antitrust investigators, such as letting iPhone users install apps through other means than the App Store.On the other hand, Epic Games could relent and come back to the app store without any change in the fee structure. That happened in the past, when it went through a public argument with Google that ended with Epic being convinced that it would after all have to keep giving a cut ot the Play Store.Or, of course, nothing could happen at all. Fortnite might never return to the iPhone, and only be available on Android devices through workarounds that would be a dramatic conclusion, but perhaps the only one that would allow all three of the companies not to give up on their publicly voiced principles.Whatever happens, the conclusion is not going to effect only Fortnite. Epic Games has already been supported by other companies such as Spotify and Tinder, all of whom have to give Google and Apple a cut of revenue too, and antitrust investigations are ongoing in the US and Europe – the Fortnite saga will almost certainly set a precedent that will be followed closely across the world.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Separate figures by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 56,800 fatalities in the UK with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate.It came as the government’s scientific advisory group, Sage, said it did not have confidence that the R rate was below 1 in England, despite their official estimate of the UK’s infection rate – which has a time-delay of several weeks – remaining unchanged at between 0.8 and 1.However, estimates of the growth rate of transmissions provided by Sage subgroup, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), indicated a slight increase, rising from between minus five per cent to zero last week to between minus four per cent to minus 1.“We are starting to see early indications that these values may be increasing,” both Sage and the Government Office for Science said on Friday in a statement.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And then he added all these running scenes. So, that was it. It was, like, better than an Oscar. I was so happy! I was so happy that I got to run on-screen with Tom Cruise.”Though Wallis – who is promoting her new film The Silencing – did not elaborate on Cruise’s running rule, it appears to be in place because Cruise is concerned that other actors cannot keep up with him.Cruise has a reputation for being meticulous and extremely driven. Earlier this year, Rob Lowe reflected on working with him on the 1983 movie The Outsiders, saying the actor went “ballistic” when the pair were told to share a hotel room.When the young stars went to New York for the final selection for Francis Ford Coppola’s film, Cruise was apparently upset about not having his own suite. “It was the first time I ever stayed at The Plaza Hotel, said Lowe. I remember going, ‘Wow, this guy is the real deal.’ I mean it made me laugh, it was gnarly. But in the end of it, you can’t argue with the results. He’s had his eye on the ball since day one.”Val Kilmer, who played Tom Iceman Kazansky in 1986’s Top Gun, also said that during filming, Cruise was so “laser-focused” on making his character Pete Maverick Mitchell the “greatest action hero in the history of film” that he “refrained from revelry” with the other actors.Cruise can next be seen in Mission: Impossible 7, which has reportedly been hit by yet another delay after a motorbike stunt went dangerously wrong.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He won\u0027t be able to lead a normal life at any point, without being recognised and facing hostility.“A prosecutor who goes public knows that.

The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

And most are itching to get back to work.Sir Keir must stop watching from the sidelines, be vocal, and help the Government get our kids back to school.He can start by seeing off this shameless wrecking bid.THE news that deaths are down on the five-year national average for the seventh week running is cause for real celebration.Butwe are to keep the good news coming, sick Brits MUST go out and use the NHS when they need it.Alarming figures released last week showed that for every three people who died of coronavirus during lockdown, another two died because they wouldn’t or couldn’t access proper treatment for other ailments.Unless Brits start dealing with their health concerns now, it’s possible that deaths caused by lockdown could end up eclipsing those caused by Covid-.The low fatality rate should also be a wake-up call for young and healthy employees still claiming that they don’t feel safe going back to work.Covid is waning, but the unemployment epidemic is just beginning.THE world is rightly raising a collective eyebrow at Vladimir Putin’s irresponsible claim that Russia has developed a working Covid vaccine.Russia’s leader has a habit of being economical with the truth, and his scientists have worked suspiciously quickly.The world is desperate for a jab to end the global misery, but Putin and his Kremlin cronies are stamping over all accepted scientic standards.This macho power play is nothing short of reckless.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looks good on the CV.I say “results” — of course, they are not results, as such. Instead, teachers have been tasked with deciding how well each student might have donerequired to sit an exam. These predictions are then weighted by the exam boards.As you might expect, teachers tend to overrate the abilities of their students. Not least because it makes THEM look good. In Scotland, they were over-generous to the tune of  per cent — and even more so in some “deprived” areas.The Scottish schoolkids were pretty hacked off to find their grades reduced by the boards, and moaned about it. So the Scottish government caved in and let them have their original grades. The ones that were overvalued.And so when little Jimmy proudly displays his long list of As and Bs to prospective employers — or, God help us, a university — people will just snigger.They know he can’t spell his own name or, like the rabbits in Watership Down, count past five. Nobody will take the results seriously after the Scottish government did its cowardly U-turn.Sadly for the youngsters, they will be pretty meaningless results. Which is a horrible thing to say after they’ve been studying for so long.South of the border we’re doing things a little better. Kids will be able to take the grade awarded to them. Or they can choose to use the result they got in their mocks — exams taken before Mr Covid arrived on the scene. Or they can take a special written exam in the autumn.That’s more sensible. But I suspect, even so, that employers and the universities will be a little wary of taking the results at face value. They will have their doubts.All of this has happened because we’re trying to be kind to the kids. And the reason we’re being kind is because these past six months we have let them down badly. The Government has let them down — and even more so, the teachers.Too many schools had no virtual classrooms at all during lockdown. The kids might have been sent a few worksheets. But time with their teachers was non-existent, even via Zoom.Too many teachers have been absolutely bone idle. Two-thirds of children have taken part in no virtual lessons whatsoever. Schools refused to make them — so the kids skived. And that’s in schools where there WERE regular virtual lessons.My own child, a girl of , completed five physics papers during lockdown. And being my daughter, sent them to the wrong email address. Nobody checked, nobody cared.The truth is our kids have had six months of doing nowt. Being nice to them now because we ignored their needs through spring and summer is all well and good. But it does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of the teaching unions. Nor the failure of the Government to stand up to the unions.The result of all this will be a bigger ide than ever between poorer and richer kids. The middle classes are flocking to the private sector — where schools WILL be open and there’s always a full timetable of virtual work.For the rest — just the suspicion that they have been treated very badly indeed. By the people whose responsibility it was to look after them.It’s time Labour came clean about our teachers. Do they want the schools to reopen or not  And no more weasel words about keeping everybody safe. You cannot eliminate risk entirely, as Sir Keir Starmer well knows.We are now in a recession. Nothing will drag us out of it more quickly than the schools reopening, full-time, no s nor buts. Then the rest of us can get back to work.THE former boss of McDonald’s is in trouble for having exchanged nude pics with fellow workers.Brit Steve Easterbrook, pictured with Alesha Dixon at the London  Olympics, is also in trouble for having slept with a few colleagues.Now, those pics.I don’t knowSteve has a Whopper, a Quarter Pounder, a Big n’ Tasty – or just a chicken nugget. But nobody complained about them at the time. All of his relationships were consensual. And Steve was a orcee. What seems to me wrong is McDonald’s banning all of its staff from having relationships in-house.I WONDER how Prince Andrew has been coping during this heatwave If you remember, he explained to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he has an inability to sweat. Just can’t do it. He must be bursting, underneath his skin. Perhaps he will explode.Me, I’m sick of sweating. A three-minute walk to the local river ends up with me looking like I’ve just swam a mile in it.I’ve even started wearing shorts, which I hate. The noncey scout leader look – it’s all the rage.The BBC was worrying about this hot spell. Wonderedit was the result of global warming.Isn’t it something to do with that thing called “summer” I seem to remember it kind of happening before, you know I’m talking about the people who, in the middle of a global pandemic, travel abroad for their holidays. And are then surprised there are problems on account of the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic.Truth is, I have about as much sympathy as I do for people who travel to appalling war-torn countries for their hols then whine at the British Government to get them out.Would it hurt THAT much just to stay in the UK this summer WEDNESDAY was a pretty bad day for grouse.They have it circled in their diaries each year, in red. The “Glorious Twelfth”. This is when City boys and braying toffs take to the grouse moors and start blasting away at anything that moves. Especially grouse. Slow, heavy birds. Not very bright. Hard to miss them from eight yards with a -bore, evenyou’re a halfwit.It’s a bad day for the rest of us, too. And for our countryside. Grouse moors take up an astonishing eight per cent of our land. And yet they are kept solely for the grouse and the , or so numpties who try to shoot them every year.As a result, these moorlands are almost entirely devoid of wildle. Just barren deserts full of heather and nothing .And the gamekeepers burn the heather every spring – just when any songbirds might be nesting. The rest of their time is taken up shooting or trapping our most beautul and endangered birds of prey.Gamekeepers have almost wiped out our hen harriers, for example. Those moors should be teeming with le. Andthey were they’d be a much more attractive proposition for tourists – who would really bring money in to the local communities.Why do we preserve eight per cent of our land for the benefit of just . per cent of our population  Just so they can wear tweed for a day and pretend they’re Carlos The Jackal Probably end up glowing like one of those light sticks kids have on Bonfire Night. One expert reckoned that a side-effect was swelling up until you’re the size of the Kremlin.In the US, President Trump was suggesting swallowing disinfectant as a cure.

It’s in the deepest recession in UK history, the deepest of any G economy, and the deepest since the invention of Gross Domestic Product. There’s a glimmer of hope buried in the grim data, though. In June, when the Government began to loosen lockdown restrictions, the economy grew an astonishing . per cent. That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.OUR sympathies are with A-level students facing uncertainty today. Given the unprecedented situation has wreaked havoc with their exams, no solution is going to be perfect.And so we offer broad support to the Government and its “triple lock” strategy, which aims to give the vast majority of English and Welsh pupils the results they deserve.It makes much more sense than the indiscriminately clunky Scottish strategy — which saw thousands of kids miss out on good grades, until Nicola Sturgeon was forced to make a humiliating U-turn and bump grades up.We are concerned, though, about the long-term prospects of school leavers across the home nations.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He gave them out like he’d give out a good bottle of wine or a trip on his boat or a flight to somewhere…They were nothing more than objects to him.Numerous former associates of Epstein have also said that the rooms in his vast Manhattan townhouse, where Andrew is known to have stayed, were fitted with cameras.The cameras are said to have been intended to capture compromising footage of Epsteins guests.Describing the rumours, New York Times journalist Christopher Mason, a one-time friend of Maxwells, says: “The stories I kept on hearing were that in every guest bedroom in Jeffrey Epstein’s house, there were hidden cameras.“And that part of Jeffrey’s ability to manipulate was that he had this video of powerful men having sex with underage girls.And these recordings were held in a safe that Jeffrey was using as a power tool to manipulate wealthy guys to make them do whatever he wanted.”Shamed financier Epstein killed himself in a New York cell last August while awaiting trial on charges for the sex trafficking of minors.Andrew has long faced questions about his association with Epstein and alleged Epstein madam Ghislaine Maxwell, currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Maxwell strongly denies the allegations against her.Roberts has previously alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein over a two-year period after being introduced to him by Maxwell in the summer of .She says that, in that period, she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - once in London, once in New York, and once on Epsteins private Caribbean island.The royal has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing regarding any accusations and has not been charged with any crimes.Repersentatives for the royal did not wish to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So it starts with Confederate flags. Get them out of here. They have no place for them.”Days later, Nascar banned Confederate flags from flying at all racing events.Wallace has been dating his girlfriend Amanda Carter, , for several years, according to their social media profiles.Wallace wrote in a  Instagram post: “Our love is so strong that ya wouldn’t know we’re polar opposites. Thanks for balancing me out the last  years!”In July, Wallace revealed the couple adopted a dog named Asher together.According to The Undefeated, Wallace and Carter briefly broke up at some point, but have since rekindled their romance.Carter frequently includes Wallace in her social media posts, and said she was proud of him and supported him in June when a noose was found hanging in his garage.“I am so proud of you for standing up for what is right and continuing to do so without fear of the outcome,” she wrote. “I wish the people saying hurtful comments knew you.”“So many little boys and girls who dream of going fast but haven’t seen someone who looks like them, for all the new and old fans who felt uncomfortable coming to a race and for everyone who has experienced racism.”In July, she posted about a vacation the two took together in which they “had so much fun laughing, napping, and exploring this lil island” in South Carolina.Wallace’s response to the Black Lives Matter movement pushed him to prominence in the racing circuit this year.In addition to wearing an “I Can’t Breathe” shirt – in reference to George Floyd’s last words – Wallace has driven with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme on his car.I think by running this branding on our car, putting the hashtag out there, bringing more awareness to it, it lines up with the videos that we had put out as Nascar, Wallace said.Listening and learning. Educating ourselves. So people will look up what this hashtag means.

I wouldve checked Sergey Grishin outI was buying a house from him.As a woman who has had to deal with all this, its very dficult to to wake up and see Sergey Grishin selling his house to such high stature people, especially somebody like Meghan who has been such a strong advocate for womens rights.She added: I believe its important to speak out and hopefully well gain some more allies instead of picking up the computer and seeing that two allies that we would love to have are buying a house from him.This is a person who has endless resources, endless amounts of money so to get any more money from people we would like to be allies with Anna and I, and be helping us, its heartbreaking to see.I wish that they were our allies and not his buyers.Jenners legal battle with Grishin began three years ago when he filed a lawsuit accusing her and ex we Anna of having a lesbian affair and trying to defraud millions of dollars from him.He claims the women failed to pay back , he lent them to fund a movie they were making - claims both strongly deny.They hit back in a counter suit alleging that Grishin “sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images to his we and Sulkess in text and video messages”.Grishin strongly denies all of their claims and claims he was “the unfortunate victim of a fraud”.One message allegedly from Grishin to Anna, submitted to court in March, he allegedly writes: I don’t care that you’ve given up. I will simply punish you by cutting you up piece by piece, from the tail. Until I reach your head. THAT’S WHAT’LL HAPPEN [emoticon]Your le has really ended.Another states: “I am now in Total destruction mode. Im taking steps that could do much harm to you in every possible way . . . And understand and believe I am just a killing machine now.”As well as multiple threatening messages allegedly from Grishin to both women, all submitted to court in Los Angeles, one alleged text message made a sick joke about child abuse.Another, seen by The Sun, referenced a racist joke about President Barack Obama.  But he vigorously denies any wrongdoing.Jenner was granted a three-year restraining order against Grishin by a judge in Los Angeles but remains afraid after Grishins threats, included in court papers, that he would come after, destroy and take everything from her and everyone she loves.She said: I had a trial for the restraining order and I won... the judge ruled in my favor and gave me a three-year order until April .But this is a letime of fear...I dont just go to the grocery store and feel normal.Jenner and Anna are seeking  million in damages accusing him of assault, battery, extortion, domestic violence, invasion of privacy and cyberstalking. A hearing in the case will take place in LA in October but the trial has been postponed due to COVID-.Lawyers for Grishin accuse Anna of making numerous  accusations to pressure him into paying her a settlement.They add: Mr. Grishin unequivocally denies harming or threatening to harm anyone. He has never been charged with any crimes because he has not violated the law. It is unfortunate that  allegations made in a civil case have now been raised because of a high-profile real estate transaction – and before Mr. Grishin had an opportunity to prove his case at trial in a Court of law.It seems unfortunately to be the case that in order to further pressure Mr Grishin into paying them money to which they are not entitled, Fedoseeva and Sulkess are using the royal couple and the purchase of their new home, in furtherance of their scheme to extort funds from SG.The truth is that Mr. Grishin is the unfortunate victim of a fraud perpetrated by his former we Ms. Anna Fedoseeva in respect of which he has been obliged to file legal proceedings against her.His legal claim sets out that fewer than two months after their marriage, Ms. Fedoseeva became romantically involved with another woman, Jenner Sulkess, and thereafter entered into a scheme to defraud him out millions of dollars to finance her and Ms. Sulkess’ lestyles.When that fraudulent scheme failed, Ms. Fedoseeva made a series of  and highly defamatory allegations about Mr. Grishin – including of physical threats and violence – which are utterly fancul, hotly denied and have no basis in truth whatever, and which Mr. Grishin trusts will be proven to be entirely  when the matter comes before the court.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Together, we can redesign it.“Companies like yours have the chance to reconsider your role in funding and supporting online ­s that have contributed to, stoked, and created the conditions for a crisis of hate, a crisis of health, and a crisis of truth.”He called for online communities to be “defined more by compassion than hate, by truth instead of misinformation, by equity and inclusiveness instead of fearmongering, by free, rather than weaponised, speech”.There is no suggestion the duke and duchess had any knowledge of or condoned the offensive messages.Online support from #SussexSquad Twitter accounts were hailed in the recently published unofficial biography Finding Freedom, which quoted Harry telling a friend: “To see that support and positivity means a lot.”But archived pages reveal the Henryscousin account — which was deactivated on August  — was a cesspit of abuse against the Royal Family.On September  last year, someone on the account posted: “The Queen wishes she could’ve raised her children half as good as Doria raised hers. Anyway . . .”That was followed up with: “Also, #AbolishTheMonarchy b***h.”On December , a message was posted under a video of “Kate shaking off William’s hand on her shoulder”, which read: “I really do believe he’s an a**hole.”A tweet during the Megxit talks on January  — which did not make clear who it was referring to — reads: “That ugly horse face b***h is just bitter she still lives in a dead woman’s shadow.”Nine days later, another tweet stated: “Meghan’s pit stop in the Royal Family is all these inbred hoes are gonna be talking about for the next  years.“ShE StOLe OuR PrIncE!” She did, bitch! She f***ing did!” Other tweets from someone named Just Harry include, “You never even hear Kate. She barely knows how to form a sentence” and “The way that Harry and Meghan aren’t part of that s**t, messy, toxic institution anymore is most pleasing to me”.Trin, from Lisbon, Portugal, used the same Henryscousin troll account on June  to boast of her personal call from the Sussexes.It came days after a Zoom meeting with royal staff thanking the #SussexSquad group for raising ­charity cash to mark baby Archie’s first birthday.A delighted Trin told her ­fellow supporters: “This was a short call with the sole purpose to thank us all for our efforts in putting such an amazing effort in and also for our enthusiastic support in the past two years.“They both sounded so thankful, so moved and so happy for having our support.“Meghan did tell me to, ‘Pass on the message’.“I’m humbled to have been used as a messenger to pass on their words of gratitude to you all. Calling me was like calling all of us.“Acknowledging me personally and so directly was like doing the same to all of us.”Trin said she was one of eight #SussexSquad members who had a password to the Henryscousin account but denied personally writing abusive messages.She told The Sun: “I feel like it’s not my place to condemn or approve another person’s tweets.“It’s their opinion. Henryscousin was like a forum and I had no control what other ­people posted.“The group disbanded and the account was deactivated due to irreconcilable dferences.”Buckingham Palace and The Sussexes all declined to comment last night.But royal expert Tom Quinn, the author of Kensington Palace: An intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle said the Sussexes had been “naive”.He added: “The fact that Meghan and Harry have thanked a Twitter user that is also connected to nasty, vicious remarks about the Royal Family and others shows once again just how naive they are.“The problem is that Meghan and Harry rely on their friends for advice about using social media so they get themselves into trouble.“They would be much better using media professionals.“But in this — as in so many cases — they always think they know best.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that a Nigel Farage figure sent sketches back from Kent beaches of Flemish refugees fleeing lowland flooding, which were pinned on billboards under slogans telling of “The REAL Killer Plague.” Because whenever this country is in crisis, royals and foreigners are the go-to smokescreens. In this catastrophic year, Prince Andrew took our mind off things. And now there’s a much-hyped book out, clearly approved by Prince Harry, in which he whines from a Calornian mansion, with nil self-awareness, about the terrible hand le has dealt him.If a second Covid wave hits expect Anne or Edward to come out.  Meanwhile – as Farage desperately seeks relevance by calling asylum-seekers in dinghies heading here from war-torn countries an “invasion”, and the equally desperate Priti Patel proposes military action to outflank him – the truth about the UK housing a mere  % of the world’s refugees is lost. Just as the Queen Mum did East End photo-ops during the Blitz and the cowardly French were blamed for Hitler having Dover in his sights, it’s standard British distraction tactics from a government losing its grip. The dference being that in the past they got away with it. But no amount of royal drama or xenophobia will help Boris Johnson and his motley crew, because it is the most incompetent government in living memory. Each day throws up fresh evidence of its pitul inadequacy. My new favourite is that not only did they screw up every aspect of the Covid fight, resulting in the worst death rate in Europe, they couldn’t correctly add up the corpses.

Facial threading and waxings resume in England almost five months after they were banned in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-. Snooker fansto the World Championship at The Crucible, Sheffield, to watch the final. The moves were announced alongside plans to relax rules on businesses including bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: The nationaposs hard work to keep the virus under control means we can now make further careful progress on recovery with allowing audiences back for indoor performances, fans back at sports events and the reopening of more Covid- secure leisure businesses. We must all continue to stay alert but todayaposs welcome news means these organisations can finally get going safely, and we can enjoy more of the things we love as a nation. I have no doubt that they will work incredibly hard to keep their fans, patrons and customers safe. Hereaposs what you can - and canapost - do from tomorrow as coronavirus lockdown rules are eased. Holdwedding receptions  Wedding ceremonies have been allowed since  July, but only for a maximum of  people - and that includes the photographer. But until this weekend, the happy couple havenapost been allowed to celebrate their union in a traditional knees-up with friends and family. Rules had been set to change from August  in England to allow small, socially-distanced receptions of up to  people.But the move was one of those postponed for at least two weeks by  Boris Johnson.Receptions can now take place of up to  people in the form of a sit-down meal. Live entertainment venues will be allowed to reopen for performances for the first time in months - but thereaposs still a few catches. The maximum capacity of some venues will have to be reduced to ensure social distancing rules can be observed. And theyaposll have to deep clean regularly - including between performancesthereaposs more than one a day. The guidance says people should be seated, not standing - and recommends using booths, barriers and screens between performers and audience where possible. It also says venues with balconies should keep the first m worth of seats empty, so anyone coughing and spluttering in the cheap seats doesnapost infect the entire theatre. The biggest issue, particularly for live music performances, is going to be the ban on singing. Thataposs right, venues are asked to ensure audiences donapost need to unduly raise their voices to each other and discourage singing along to music or cheering, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that encourage shouting. The actorsapos union Equity said: “While we welcome this news, the majority of live performance can’t reopen with socially distanced audiences. “Our members are still out of work and in urgent need of income support.” Have brow and facial treatments  Salons were banned from restarting close-contact beauty treatments such as eyebrow waxing and facials with just a dayaposs notice, leaving customers disappointed. That is despite salons having opened from July . The dference is because thereaposs more risk of Covid-youaposre face-to-face with someone. From Saturday, these treatments can resume, including brows, eyelash treatments, make up applications and botox. New rules mean hairdressers and salon staff will have to wear surgical masks as well as clear visors, following a change in the scientic advice. This also applies to workers who visit people at home, such as massage therapists.  About  fans will be allowed into Sheffieldaposs Crucible Theatre to watch the World Championship Snooker final which begins on Saturday. The Championship became the first indoor live sports event in England to have crowds since lockdown, allowing some supporters in for the three sessions on July .However, they were kicked out the next day when a spike in coronavirus cases led the Government to halt its gradual lockdown relaxations.World Snooker said: “We are delighted to announce that a reduced crowd will be welcomed to all sessions of the final of the World Championship on Saturday and Sunday.” The snooker was among pilot matches where fans were admitted to test the safeof spectators at sports events. Ministers hope to allow a wider , with social distancing rules in force, from October. But getting back to normal with cheering supporters packed into stadiums is a long way off. Kids canto soft play centres - but not ball pits  Soft play centres will be allowed to re-open from this weekend. But theyaposll have to comply with a strict new set of rules. They include having hand sanitiser stations, one-way systems, reduced capacity, online booking, increased cleaning and antibacterial fogging. Visitors over the age of  will have to wear face coverings - and children must stay socially distanced and be supervised at all times. And crucially, the ball pit is out. Loose play items like the balls in ball pits will have to be removed because theyaposre hard to clean.  Punters can stick or twist at casino blackjack tables, claim a strike at ten-pin bowling alleys and glide on skates around ice rinks. The venues had been due to reopen two weeks ago but the lting of restrictions was axed at the last minute as infections crept up. British Ice Skating tweeted today: “Ice Rinks in England can open from tomorrow. “Yes! Letaposs get our athletes #backontheice. Thank you to everyone for their support.” Hollywood Bowl said: “Following the latest directive from the UK Government we are pleased to announce the reopening of our English bowling centres on Saturday th August. “Ten pin bowling is great all round fun whether you’re with family, friends or work colleagues. “With state-of-the-art bowling alleys, delicious food and drink and awesome arcades, we promise to keep everyone entertained.” ...and which parts of the country will remain more restricted for now  The latest lockdown relaxations do not apply in “specic areas where local restrictions are in place”. They include parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire. And a small section of businesses across the country must still remain closed, despite this weekendaposs fresh easing of curbs.

Boris Johnson finally introduced the rule more than three weeks after his experts said wearing a clear plastic visor wasnapost enough to stop Covid-.The only compulsory thing hairdressers have had to wear since they reopened on July  has been a face visor. A covering hasnapost ever been needed over their nose and mouth - despite becoming compulsory in nearly all indoor public spaces and on public transport.In a meeting on July , a sub-group of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesruled visors alone are unlikely to be an effective control for aerosol transmission.SAGE added: We recommend that guidance for UK hairdressers and barbers should be strengthened to include wearing of face coverings. Yet the government dawdled over the findings for weeks, leading experts to speak out in protest. Now the guidance has finally been updated - and goes even further than what SAGE said on July . Instead of wearing a face covering, which can include a scarf or piece of cloth, anyone working in close contact services must now wear a full type  surgical mask. This includes hairdressers and barbers, as well as nail and beauty salons, tattoo, tanning and massage parlours, and dress fitters and tailors. Each mask must be worn only once and then discarded safely, ideally into a non-touch and self-closing bin.  New guidance adds: A Type II face mask should be worn with the visor. Type II face masks are not PPE but will provide a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the mouth and nose when used correctly. Ensure you are hydrated before putting a mask on. Face masks must also not be touched once on the face, and must be changedthey become moist or damaged, or dficult to breathe through. Downing Street said the move was taking into account new evidence provided by SAGE and consultation with industry. A statement added: This will help protect the customer and staff from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing, or speaking.  The original guidance to hairdressers, when they opened on July , said wearing a face covering may only be marginally beneficial, and the evidence it would protect customers is weak and the effect is likely to be small. Those phrases were removed on July , the day after the expertsapos meeting, and replaced with the words: There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect iniduals and those around them from COVID-. However, face coverings are not an alternative for employees who wear a visor in close contact services. The guidance has now been updated yet again. The scientists made their recommendation after a US study found two COVID- infected hairdressers, who wore face coverings, did not pass on the disease to  clients.

However it warned this is based on factors including deaths and hospital admissions which can take a few weeks to show up in the data. The ONS surveillance testing of , people revealed new infections had surged by % in the week up to July  before dropping slightly in the week ending August . Katherine Kent, head of the ONS Covid- Infection Survey, said: “This week’s estimate suggests that the increase in infections in England seen in July has now levelled off. “Regional analysis of antibody data for England, published for the first time this week, show that a higher percentage of people in London have ever tested positive for antibodies to the virus than in Yorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands, the South East and the South West.”  Another Covid- spike could have big implications for the country with children due toto schools in a few weeks. The R number is the average number of people infected by each Covid- case. A separate “growth rate” measures the percentage that the UK outbreak is shrinking each day.

As the video begins, the driver is seen parked up on the street in Portsmouth. He jumps out and pops the boot, to reveal a load of parcels bearing the Amazon smile logo. He then walks over to Sarahaposs garage, unzips his trousers and begins to urinate. He looks around quickly before fastening his trousers and heading back to the car, treading in the puddle of urine as he goes. Without washing or sanitising his hands, he then picks up and removes several parcels from his boot ready to deliver. A horried Sarah took to social media to complain to Amazon, sharing the video and saying: Can you please explain to me why your driver is taking a p*** against my garage  Is this acceptable behaviour, I suggest you trace him and send him back to clean my garage. If he is not available then I suggest you send professional cleaners. Before I send this video to the police.

Natalie Reynolds added: Jesus especially in the current situation we canapost even cough or sneeze let alone urinate on someoneaposs property! Gross. And Stephen Morgan said: That is disgusting.

Shopper Eve Whitty was left fuming with Asdaaposs response to her complaints regarding face masks in her local store. She said she couldnapost believe how many people werenapost wearing masks at the supermarket and went to raise her concerns with a member of staff. Eve also approached a group of men who she described as being in their twenties to ask why they were not wearing face masks and the following day she emailed a complaint to Asda, reports the Liverpool Echo. Eve has said she just wanted to highlight her concerns and was frustrated with Asdaaposs response that they are encouraging customers to wear a face covering. Asda said they are doing all they can to remind customers to follow the rules but ultimately it is up to police to enforce them. Eve visited the Huyton store on July  for one of the first times in months after she had been shopping online for herself and for her elderly relatives. She said: I said to a member of staff excuse me could I smoke in the store and she said you canapost do that in the store. I said  I was smoking in here you would stop me so why isnapost it the same for face masks and they said there was nothing they could do about it. I was absolutely fuming. Out of curiosity, Eve then approached three men and askedmasks were mandatory and they said yes, so she questioned why they werenapost wearing them. One shopper allegedly said they had breathing dficulties, so Eve asked why their friends werenapost wearing them, before deciding to walk away. The following day, Eve emailed Asda to complain as she has visited other shops were customers have been turned away unless they are exempt. But she said her biggest issue was the use of the word encouraging in part of Asdaaposs response.  In the email, Asda said: We are strongly encouraging all customers to wear a face covering when they visit our stores. We also have signs at the entrance to the store and on the shelf edges to encourage customers to wear a face covering and are using Asda FMto further remind customers. While we will do all we can to strongly encourage customers to respect the new guidelines, the responsibility for policing and enforcing them does lie with the relevant authorities. Eve said she wants to see Asda become more stricter and doesnapost want bigger stores or customers to get complacent.  She said her relatives are worried to go shopping as a result and that now she is only going to shop in stores when itaposs extremely necessary. Eve said: They’re [my relatives] frightened to go out. The thought of what I told them about Asda has made them worried to go in there. The word that cuts me up is encourage. It’s mandatory. Itaposs fine for young people - I know some have medical issues - butthey donapost it may not be a big thing for them. But for older people itaposs not fair. There are people whoaposve had to shield for four months. It’s gotten me down. Some people aren’t taking it that seriously. Guidelines say that people working in shops do not have to wear a face covering, but that customers should do so.

The UK government announced late last night that all travellers ing from France must now self isolate for  days from am Saturday. The Foreign Office also advised against all non-essential travel to France It sparked a mad rush to get back to the UK before tomorrow with big queues forming at the ferry port this morning as Brits tried to rush home. Are you on holiday in France at the moment or due to fly out  Email us at webtravel@trinitymirror Eurotunnel and Brittany Ferries have warned people not to turn up at terminals unless they have a booking. But savvy Julia Burnett, , and husband Craig, , had already cut short their camping holiday fearing the worst and were just  miles from Calais when the announcement was made. They drove yesterday for an incredible  hours from the South of France to Calais with their three children Rory, seven, Isabella, five and Finley, one.  They were due to come back next Wednesday but yesterday decided to set off from Biarritz, after reading rumours about a potential quarantine. The family, from Taunton in Somerset, managed to book onto a ferry less than an hour before the government announcement. When they were  miles from Calais they discovered their gamble had paid off when they saw news of the rule change. They were in the queue for the ferry crossing feeling “tired but relieved” this morning.  Julia said: “We’d been trying to book onto the Channel tunnel but we eventually booked on the ferry instead. “Then I checked back on the tunnel website straight after the announcement and I was ,th in the queue - it was crazy. “Quarantine would have really affected Craig’s work as he runs a dental services business and can’t do it from home.” The Burnett family were among half a million Brits said to be on holiday in France, with around , expected toto the UK before the summer holidays end.  Lucky Brits who were already due totoday or who managed to get a last minute booking arrived back in Londonaposs St Pancras station this morning. But many others scrambling to get home face paying hundreds of pounds and blasted the government’s decision. Lewis Kitson, , was desperately trying to book a ticket at the ferry port in Calais this morning. The IT manager, of Putney, south west London, said: “This is just a complete shambles. They’re making it up as they go along now. It’s chaos.  “They can’t justy this. It’s guess work. I’m not bothered about quarantineI’m too late. I’ve just come through France on a road trip. “They’ll have to put me in prison before I comply with quarantine. “The whole thing is ridiculous. It’s still not enough time. I’m really trying to get a ferry booked.” Michael Smallwood, , booked eight days’ camping in Calais with four pals. He was due to travel back on Monday but was today frantically trying to transfer his tickets after his we this morning called him from their home in New Ash Green, Kent, to tell him of the new rules.  Michael, who owns a cleaning business, said: “I’ve got lots of work planned in the next two weeks and soI don’t get back today, this could severely affect me financially. “It was announced late at night and I wish we had been given more time to get out. “PO’s response has been pretty disappointing so far. I haven’t been able to get through on the phone and I’m struggling to change our tickets.” British businessman Charlie Varley – who owns holiday homes in northern France - launched a scathing attack on Boris Johnsonaposs decision to impose quarantine. He said: “Itaposs a bloody nightmare. “Weaposve been hit all season because of the Brit government’s indecisive bulls**t.  “We have already had several cancellations we have had to refund earlier in the season and here we go again. “Ourselves and countless other gîteowners have lost a large part of our customer base. “And then the insurance companies refuse to pay out those customers who took out insurance because the British government just gave them a get out clause. “If the government imposed a quarantine, most people’s holiday insurance is null and void because technically they can still take the holiday. It’s not a valid reason to cancel and for the insurance to pay out. “One of our guests who cancelled earlier said it left her children in tears. “They were so looking forward to their visit and the kids, just youngsters couldn’t understand why mum and dad had to cancel their holidays. “And this was before the quarantine. “They cancelled because of the uncertainty. “And let’s not forget it was ok for Boris’ dad to sneak off to Greece to check on his rental properties and for Cummings to take trips to stay with mum and dad. “Itaposs hard to keep up with the hypocrisy, indecision and buck passing of the British government these days.” People trying to get back to the UK face sky high prices.British Airways is charging £ for the cheapest tickets to fly direct from Paris to London Heathrow. The same journey on Saturday can be made with the airline for just £. The cheapest ticket on a Eurostar train from Paris to London is £, compared with £ on Saturday.

Areas around the market town of Halax now have infection rates higher than key hotspots such as Leicester, Blackburn and Darwen and Luton, she said. Government data shows the ward of Pellon East has seen a stark rise in cases, with  recorded between August  and . Pellon West and Highroad Well had  cases of coronavirus recorded across the same week. Debs Harkins has now appealed to the people of Calderdale to in a desperate bid to get help from residents to bring the rate back down again.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereYorkshire, along with other major northern hubs such as Manchester and Leeds were placed back on lockdown meaning two households were no longer allowed to meet. The rules means families and friends could only socialise with those who they lived with or one other person living alone who had already formed a bubble with another houehold. The rules applied to both indoor and outdoor socialising.In her statement, Debs Harkins said it is clear that too many restrictions were lted too quickly and said she cannot stress how serious the situation is, reports Yorkshire Live. She said: The first of August was four months to the day since I started working in Calderdale. I began my work here at the beginning of April, a couple of weeks into the national lockdown. I marked my four-month anniversary with the introduction of local restrictions, brought in because the borough has one of the highest COVID- infection rates in the country. I have to say, these four months have been some of the hardest times in my  years working in public health. Just to give you some perspective, the only time that compares to this for me was the  months when I worked from a hospital isolation room as I underwent treatment for an aggressive form of Leukaemia, which I only had a % chance of recovering from.  Being the voice of doom doesn’t come naturally to me. I try to find the positives in every situation, even being treated with a le-threatening illness! But I’m sorry to say that I’m writing this today to stress how serious the situation in Calderdale is, and to ask for your help to tackle COVID-. I have been out and about in the borough, talking and listening to people in our communities, and I have heard from many people how shocked they are that COVID- is still here with us. I heard that people made enormous sacrices to keep infection rates low, and when the restrictions were lted in June, they believed that things would start toto normal and we could all start to enjoy the things we used to take for granted. People in high incidence areas told me they feel stigmatised and blamed for the situation we now find ourselves in. When we look at the trends in confirmed cases in Calderdale, it’s clear that too many restrictions were lted too quickly.  In parts of Halax particularly, the infection rates are among the very highest in the country. The situation can change rapidly, and at the time I’m writing this, there are no areas in Leicester, Blackburn with Darwen or Luton, where the infection rates are higher than those we can see in some parts of Halax. Infection rates in Calderdale are currently increasing faster than in any other borough in the Yorkshire and Humber region. She continued: I’m asking for your help today to bring the infection rate down. This is important to us all for many reasons. We all want to get our freedoms back so we can visit family and friends outside our households. Many of us will know people who are medically vulnerable to the serious effects of COVID- and will want to ensure that the infection rate remains low to protect them, as the national shielding programme ends and we prepare for the winter demands on health and care services.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are believed to have taken out a £.million mortgage to buy their palatial nine-bedroom Calornian estate. The seller of the -built property was a limited liability company tied to controversial Russian investor Sergey Grishin. The billionaire is the former owner of another nearby home, known as the Scarface mansion after it appeared in the  Al Pacino movie. Grishin and his ex-we Anna Fedoseeva are currently embroiled in an intense legal battle. He denies her claims that he held a gun to her head and knocked her teeth out. In court documents it is alleged that he sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images to his we andSulkess in text and video messages, the Sun reported.It is alleged he texted Fedoseeva claiming he had a Glock for her. The same documents include allegations that he pointed a gun with a silencer at her head and forced her to strip. Grishin denies the claims.A spokesperson for the Russian said he was the aposvictim of a fraudapos and claimed his ex-we planned to defraud him of millions of dollars to fund her le with her new partner, MailOnline reported.Grishin later claimed, in a lawsuit filed in Calornia, that his we and her new partner Sulkess were lovers and they were trying to trick him out of millions of dollars. When that failed she Fedoseeva began making aposapos claims against Grishin, the spokesperson added.  Fedoseeva told MailOnline: I keep reading articles which say that Harry and Meghan have aposquietlyapos bought this house. I would try and keep it quiet tooI bought a house from a Russian oligarch who was…in court for terrorising his we with a gun. He is a monster. Regardless of the homeaposs former owners, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will now need to find almost £, per month over the next  years to cover the repayments, property taxes and insurances.The couple managed to secure a mortgage despite still owing the British taxpayer £.million for the renovation of Frogmore Cottage, their former home near Windsor Castle.It was previously agreed the former senior royals would pay £, a month to repay the cost of refurbishing the cottage which they left when they fled the UK in November last year. A source said: All combined, Harry and Meghan need to find around £, per month to meet their financial commitments. It is a staggering amount. No wonder they want to get working.  The couple had faced paying much more for their new home, but after haggling over the price for the ,-square-foot house, they managed to knock more than £. million of the asking price. Harry, , and Meghan, , eventually landed the mansion which boasts a rose garden, pool, theatre, arcade, childrenaposs play area and guest house,for £. million after putting down a £. million deposit. It also has a stripper pole installed in its gym. Tax records for the seven-acre property, which took five years to complete, match limited liability companies previously created by the Duchess. Documents seen by the Mirror show the Suessexaposs house was bought by a company called the Residential Real Estate Trust on June . Although there are no names attached to the secretive trust, it matches that of a previous LLC created up by Meghan called Frim Fram Inc. Pictures previously taken inside the home show high beamed ceilings, mock real fires, a library, ten-seater dining room, spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, theatre and a wine cellar. Guests can be entertained in the games room complete with poker table,pinball machines, bar and pool table. Photographs of the interior found in old listings show one of the bedrooms has a childrenaposs bedroom shaped like a pink princess castle. Outside, the sprawling estate is hedged and gated from the street and reached by a winding drive paved with hand-cut, locally sourced stone. Beyond the entrance are tiered English rose gardens, -year-old olive trees and tall Italian cypress trees, five-car garage manicured laws and large swimming pool.  Other features include a tennis court, a childrenaposs cottage, a tea house,and on the south end of the grounds sits a two bed two bath guest house should they invite any of the royals to visit. According to US reports, Meghanaposs mother, Doria Ragland, who is helping to look after the coupleaposs one-year-old son Archie, has already been to the house. A source told the Mirror: Meghan has been desperate to find a home her and Harry can raise their family in. It no secret they would like a little brother or sister for Archie. They think they have found the perfect home in which they and their children can thrive. It wouldnapost be a surprisethey were still there when their children go on to have kids. Sources say the couple left their temporary home on Vancouver Island,Canada, in March to begin house hunting in earnest.  When they first arrived in Los Angeles, they lived in a £ million Beverly Hills mansion loaned to them by American star Tyler Perry. Real estate agent Elham Anders told the Mirror the Sussexes will have paid a premium for their privacy, not just a home. She said: People like Oprah and other stars leave Hollywood behind because Montecito and Santa Barbara provide them with the peace and quiet they want. Because it is a celebrity enclave stars come and go as they pretty much please without being bothered. Houses here are expensive, but itaposs not just bricks and mortar people are paying for - its privacy. When I speak to a lot of my clients, many place that at the top of their list in terms of what they want from a property. Harry and Meghan could live there for months without anyone seeing them.  The property is located on a private road in a luxury and secluded estate in Montecito. The home is around a two-hour drive from downtown Los Angeles, and almost every house in the multi-million-pound neighbourhood is designed for privacy, with long driveways and large gates. Neighbours include Orpah, Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Cruise, Jenner Lopez, Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg and Kevin Costner who all live close by. Some social media users have speculated Harryaposs father Prince Charles has helped the couple fund their move although sources in the States say they have paid for it themselves.

Geoff Cunlfeaposs three bed semi-detached house has a leaking roof, damp floors, peeling wallpaper, collapsed ceilings and black mould in every single room after he was preyed on by callous cold callers who offered to fit new insulation into his roof. The widowed pensioner handed over a total of £. to Eco Energy Advice Limited four years ago but only discovered the shoddy workmanship early this year when huge amounts of rainwater - which had been collecting in the loft - begin to seep into the house. A closer inspection revealed the work wasnapost completed properly meaning over time almost all of the tiles on the roof have lted. Now every time it rains Geoff is faced with more water seeping into the house causing ceilings to collapse and leaving every room damp and covered in black mould. Geoff, who has lived in the house in St Albans, Herts, for  years, was initially forced to sleep downstairs in a chair before kind neighbours used tarpaulin to temporarily make his bedroom safe again. He has also had numerous falls due to the damp, slippery floors, one of which left him needing hospital treatment. Geoff told : Iaposve lived in this house since  and have a lot of fond memories here. My we passed away in  and my son is retired now but it was a family home and we have always worked hard to look after it. When I noticed the damp coming through I borrowed a pasting table from a neighbour and was going to try and clean it up and wallpaper it myself but then it got worse and worse. A builder also advised not to touch it myself as the mould spores could be bad for my health. I have tried going through my insurance, and every other option available but Iaposm getting no help. I donapost want to live like this anymore, itaposs quite upsetting really.  The boss of Eco Energy Advice Limited, Adam Craig Roberts, was jailed for three years in June last year after a prosecution by Trading Standards. He pleaded guilty to fraudulently misleading people - often the elderly - and encouraging them to buy home insulation all to fund his own extravagant lestyle. In a bid to help repair Geoffaposs roof and bring his home back to its former glory, his neighbour, Barbara Meszaros, has set up a Go Fund Me Page to cover the cost of the damage - which builders estimate to be up to £,. Barbara said: Itaposs honestly heartbreaking. The whole house is damp and mouldy and he is living in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.  All the tiles on his roof are lted which means more water seeps in every time it rains and as we live in the UK thataposs very often. This has already resulted in two dangerous accidents. He fell down the stairs due to the damp on the floor and parts of the ceiling caving in. There is not a single room in his home that is not affected by water damage and black mould including his own bedroom, which resulted in him having to sleep in a chair downstairs. We have managed to put some tarpaulin up for now to get him back into his bed but who knows how long that will last and it is continuing to get worse day by day.He has been so upset about this and itaposs heartbreaking to see. No one, especially no one of his age, should be living like this. He has always done his best to look after the house and itaposs such a shame itaposs come to this. He is the last person to ask for charity but we have tried other avenues and nothing has worked.

Footage of Bill Morris smashing the window of the VW Golf went viral when it was posted online earlier this week. Dog enthusiasts praised the Thames Valley Police firearms dealer for coming to the houndaposs aid. At the time of his dramatic intervention Bill was visiting Newbury AE in Berkshire. As he waited to be seen by a doctor he walked to a nearby Curryaposs to buy a vacuum cleaner, only to spot the pooch in a hot car. He contacted the police having noticed that the Yorkshire Terrier was panting and leaning against the window. After being put through to  and waiting for minutes on the end of the phone, Bill realised time was running out.“The dog was minutes away from dying and I just thought ‘I need to do something here’, he told The Sun.Realising that no one  was going to step in, Bill decided to act. He went to his car and grabbed his axe - something he keeps with him as a registered firearms dealer. Bill asked fellow bystander Samantha Harvey to film his intervention and then swung the weapon eight times into the car window.  Once the dog was liberated he told some officers having lunch in MS what he had done, before ing to the vehicle. There he came face to face with the animalaposs owner. “I looked at herand asked hershe would leave her child in the car for an hour like that, and she said aposno I’m really sorry I don’t know what I’m thinkingapos, Bill said. He added: In that moment I knew thatI didn’t act then the dog was going to die.  Bill has urged anyone moved by his actions to donate to Battersea Dogaposs home. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: “A member of the public did smash a car window to get a dog out of a car.

She feels it is a bid to drive her off the app because she aposdoes not fit TikTokaposs idea of perfectapos and because cruel trolls have complained about the birthmark at the top of her thigh. And despite being told by sickos on the app to aposkill herselfapos she claims TikTok has done nothing to help her and instead apospunished herapos. TikTok denies it moderates content according to a useraposs looks and said some of Milanaaposs videos were aposremoved in errorapos. But Milana feels she has been discriminated against for posting videos wearing a bikini and shorts - when other users wear less and have not had action taken on their accounts. She was also horried when alerts allegedly flashed up on her screen saying she was aposvulgarapos as she was recording a video. Heartbroken is an understatement, she told . Iaposm strong, but I donapost want to sit back and do nothing in case this is happening to other users more vulnerable than me. Itaposs already being banned in the US and England needs to take it more seriously and people know what is really going on.The former law student joined the popular video sharing  - then known as Musical.ly - in  after being approached by a scout who praised her dance and makeup videos on Instagram. After following the instructions, she saw her followers and video views rocket. Her first video quickly gained , views and she went on to build up a following of more than , by frequently posting dance tutorials, comedy videos and beauty tutorials. I felt a bit guilty my videos were being pushed in front of other people working really hard, admitted Milana, who arranges the events for her family-run restaurant Il Padrino. She then took a break from the app, owned by ByteDance, a Beijing-based Internet technology company, before getting back in the swing of things and quickly gained another , followers. However she first noticed something was amiss when she posted a clip about a friend going into coronavirus lockdown in China - which she says got deleted.Maybe because TikTok is owned by a company in China then maybe they didnapost like it. But then it got deleted which was really crazy, she said. Milana then went on to post a clip bravely opening up about the birthmark at the top of her thigh while dressed in shorts and a jumper. She claims she was told she was breaking community guidelines but it wasnapost clear why.  I would understandI had been showing a lot of skin - but I wasnapost, she said. There are other TikTok users who show a lot more in tiny bikinis. How can they treat someone dferent because they have a birthmark or are fat or ugly  She continued: Not going to lie I have put weight on in lockdown - I have been indulging. So what ! If you canapost now, when can you  From then on she claims she would lose followers for aposviolating community guidelinesapos each time she posted a video showing her birthmark.  Milana also started to notice the source of her video views had been aposrestrictedapos to just her followers, rather than in the algorithm and through hashtags which it had been previously. Whereas other accounts who had started at the same time as her had grown to have millions of followers - she was losing fans each day with some approaching her askingshe had removed them as they were equally as baffled. Recalling how she was called aposvulgarapos, Milana said: One day I was on live on TikTok and I had an alert flash up that I was vulgar, then within  seconds I had another alert flash up that I was vulgar. Then another one said aposyour account will be suspended.apos At the time I had no viewers watching, so it was  per cent TikTok doing that. Why was it telling me I was vulgar  I came off there heartbroken.  Milana continued: I then started getting comments saying I should stop TikTok and no brands would want to work with me because of the s*** stain on my leg. My videos stopped being shown to people, but I was still getting cruel comments from people telling me to kill myself. I was asking myself aposam I overweight apos aposam I ugly apos I felt like I was being discriminated against because of my birthmark whereas other creators were showing a lot more skin. To be told by one of the biggest apps out there youaposre aposvulgarapos because of my birthmark does make you feel very low.  Milana complained to TikTok about the issues she was having with losing followers and sent screenshots of the sick messages trolls had sent her. But she claims she was fobbed off with generic responses before being told they would fix this. Whatit had been a vulnerable -year-old  she said. I was told because I have a birthmark that I was ugly and fat. Milana then set up a new account on a dferent iPhone which rapidly gained , followers.  But the same thing happened again, she said, adding she also tried to set up a third account but cruel trolls would report her appearance on that again. I feel because Iaposve got a birthmark Iaposve not been able to grow. I feel itaposs really unfair. Bullying is bullying whether itaposs by a person or an app. In worst case scenarios a lot of people end up killing themselves because people have tried to force them to commit suicide or because theyaposve been bullied online.  Itaposs really harsh when a giant app calls you vulgar for the way you look, for your birthmark. It is a bit painful. She claims people have come to her alleging the same thing has happened. Milana now uses app Triller as an online space to share her creativeness through videos. Just last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order officially banning TikTok to protect our national security.Trump claimed the app may be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok denies accusations it is controlled by or shares data with the Chinese government. Meanwhile it was also claimed earlier this year that TikTok moderators were told to suppress videos from users who appeared apostoo ugly, poor or disabledapos.It was alleged to be part of the company’s efforts to curate an aspirational air in the videos it promotes, according to  documents published by the Intercept.Users with an “abnormal body shape ,” who are “chubby … obese or too thin” or who have “ugly facial looks or facial deformities” should be removed, one document said, since “ the character’s appearance is not good, the video will be much less attractive, not worthing [sic] to be recommended to new users.” Videos were to be removed from the feed“the shooting environment is shabby and dilapidated”, since “this kind of environment is … less fancy and appealing”.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously warned that ministers would be “absolutely ruthless” in deciding on whether to impose the self-isolation requirement.Mr Johnson said the Government could not allow the UK’s population to be “reinfected or the disease to come back in”. Last night, it was announced that France, The Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks  Caicos and Aruba will added to the quarantine list from am on Saturday. Today, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed the threshold for putting countries on the quarantine list. The Tory minister said it is  cases per , on a seven-day rolling average.Email us about your holiday experiences  webtravel@trinitymirrorMr Shapps told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “With France and these other countries, the Netherlands and where, the numbers have now just got above the threshold - which is about  cases per , measured on a -day rolling average. “That’s what the Joint Biosecurity Centre will be looking at.” The government has previously refused to say exactly how countries are added to the quarantine list. Downing Street this week warned experts look not only at the infection rate per , people, but also at the testing rate and reliability of data which each country produces. The decision to add France to the list brought chaos for holidaymakers as they tried to rush home before the deadline.  The Foreign Office also now advises against all but essential travel to those destinations - in a blow for holidaymakers still planning on visiting as many travel insurance policies will be invalid. France is the latest popular holiday destination to be removed since Spain was removed on July , just five hours after it was announced.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab previously warned the government couldnapost give a guarantee that more countries wouldnapost have restrictions imposed.In an interview with Skyaposs Sophie Ridge Mr Raab said: “As we found with Spain we can’t give a guarantee.  All we can say is we’ve got this joint bio-security centre - you can see we monitor the risk in real-time. We take decisive, swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summer to people who go abroad and thataposs why our advice is to follow the Foreign Office travel advice which will also link in with the quarantine principle, look very carefully at doing that. Following Shappaposs revelation, all eyes are now on countries with rising rates. Weaposve taken a look at the data to see where is safest to travel, and where the number of infections is rising, which includes Brit holiday hotspots Croatia and Greece. Even Turkey may not be safe as the number of infections continues to rise.  Between August  - , new cases in Croatia rose to . per ,, up from . for the previous seven days. Thousands of holidaymakers have jetted off to Greece after Spain was removed from the apossafeapos list - but the rate of infection has risen rapidly.The number of new cases surged to . per ,, a figure that will have alarm bells ringing in Westminster as it jumped up from . for the previous seven days. The government has imposed strict restrictions, including orders that all bars and restaurants in Mykonos, Santorini, Corfu, Rhodes, Zante and Crete close at midnight. Gkikas Magiorkinis, assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology at Athens University, said on August : “We can say that Greece has formally entered a second wave of the epidemic. This is the point that we could win or lose the battle.The number of new cases in Denmark is also high, with officials watching as it jumped to ., from . per , for the previous seven days. And in the Czech Republic and Switzerland , the rate of infection rose to ., from . and . respectively.It has been speculated that holiday favourite Portugal could soon be added to the apossafeapos list, but officials may wait a little longer as the rate of cases jumped from  to . per , residents.The rate of infection in Poland remained at a similar rate, with the number of cases rising from . to . per ,."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d149c218a13f9.14875372-716x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc steven boyack jocky scott ivano bonetti","story":"Steven Boyack’s time wearing the dark blue of Dundee was a tale of two managers – with loyalty at the heart of the story.Going from Jocky Scott to Ivano Bonetti was never going to be straightforward and one phone call from the outgoing Dens Park legend laid bare the complexities facing a dressing room that’s lost a likeable boss.He said: “I remember when it was pretty certain Jocky Scott was leaving, I got a phone call from a journalist asking about it.“Me being young, loyal and inexperienced I said there was no way he should be leaving the club as manager.“After that Jocky said it was nice of me to do that but, ‘Don’t do it again! Remember there’s another manager coming in after’.“Maybe that didn’t help!”He joined from Rangers a -year-old, for a reported £,, in  and his arrival coincided with a spark in form that led Scott’s Dundee to equal the best top-flight finish since the league-winning side of  .But less than  months later, when Boyack wasn’t given a squad number by incoming boss Bonetti, he knew it was all over.A former Scotland U  international, the midfielder had been on the fringes of Walter Smith’s Rangers squad during the Nine in a Row era.Despite making his debut in  alongside the likes of Andy Goram, Richard Gough, Jorg Albertz, Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup – and up against Ray Wilkins in the Hibs team – he eventually moved on in search of first-team football.Step forward Dundee, with family ties making it the perfect move.“I had been at Rangers a while and it was time to move on,” he said.“I had family connections to Dundee, my dad was a big fan and was always talking about ducking school so he could go watch the AC Milan European Cup semi-final.“I think that local connection helped and I was quite happy people knew that. Dundee is a small place and I remember my granny from Broughty Ferry getting on the bus with me and saying to everyone, ‘This is my grandson, he plays for Dundee!’“It was the right move and it was great, for the most part anyway – it ended really badly.“Things started off great and I loved it at Dens. As much I was on the fringes of the first team at Rangers and playing in the reserves, Dundee was my first real club where I played consistent first-team football.“It was exciting times and completely dferent to reserve football – it’s just not the same pressure as a young guy at Rangers.“That was boy’s football – I was playing the men’s game at Dundee.“Suddenly it was a relegation battle and there’s all these experienced guys who are playing for a contract or to avoid a wage cut by being relegated.“The pressure was much more, suddenly everything was about  o’clock on a Saturday. Nothing  mattered.”The news was out that fans’ favourite Dariusz Adamczuk was leaving for Ibrox in the summer after three years at the club.Boyack said: “I remember there was a story at the time I was being brought in to replace Adamczuk because he was leaving on a Bosman, going to Rangers funnily enough.“I think it might have been right after I signed when Dariusz got sent off at Dunfermline and got a six-game ban. That gave me my start in the team.“We went on a run after that and won five on the bounce near the end of the season.“We had a good hard-working team with youth and experience mixed well, with some good players in there as well.“It was lucky how it started for me but brilliant as well.”Boyack made his first start the following week in a - win over Hearts before playing the final seven matches of the season, winning five, drawing one and losing the final match against third-placed St Johnstone.He also notched his first senior goal in a win at Pittodrie and followed up with another at home to Dunfermline as Jocky’s side romped up the ision and into a fth-placed finish.Boyack added: “I think at that time Dunfermline were at the bottom but they weren’t a million miles away from us so we needed those wins.“Jocky Scott andJimmy Bone made things very easy for us players, they were pretty old school and they built a good team. There were no favourites, they picked the best team.“We had guys like Gavin Rae in midfield, Iain Anderson, Eddie Annand, Willie Falconer, James Grady then there was Rab Douglas who wasn’t far off the best keeper in the league, he was brilliant.“Really dependable guys like Barry Smith and Brian Irvine, then there was Willie Miller who helped me a lot – anyone who kicked me, he’d kick them back twice as hard!“I think we must have had snot s of Premier League games of experience in that team but young players as well.”The following season, Boyack was a regular in the Dark Blues midfield with only Rae, Douglas and Steven Tweed featuring more for Scott’s men.The Dark Blues would finish seventh, just one point off repeating their fth place of the campaign before.However, that signalled the end of Jocky’s spell in charge and he made way for the flamboyant Bonetti regime.It was clear early on that there were going to be huge changes at Dundee and, unsurprisingly, the new manager didn’t fancy some of the stars he had inherited.But Boyack, who had played  times in the Premier League the previous season, wasn’t too concerned despite several warning signs.“We went on a pre-season trip to Italy and they didn’t seem to know who any of the Scottish players were!” he said.“Some of the older guys were saying the writing was on the wall but I didn’t listen. I said, ‘I’ve got a contract for another year andthey don’t want me, I’ll go somewhere .’”Boyack soon realised the experienced members of the Dark Blues squad were spot on and he was eventually put on the transfer list.It was too late, however, to go anywhere – a problem for a club needing to recoup some of the money they had already spent on new players.At the time, a frustrated Boyack told the Courier: “The managersaid I would remain here until another club met Dundee’s valuation but he spoke to me while watching a football video and I only got  seconds of his time.“No one has told me I am not good enough to play for Dundee and I’ve not become a bad player overnight but it’s now best I move on.”Twenty years on, Boyack is philosophical about his Dens dream turning into a nightmare under Ivano and his brother Dario.He said: “I didn’t play a minute under them but the club had a problem because they’d signed a lot of players but they’d done that before getting rid of the players they didn’t fancy.“I didn’t even get a squad number. They were bringing in good players and they gave my number to Fabian Caballero. He was brilliant so at least they gave it to somebody pretty decent.“ThenCaniggia came in#had somebody said when I signed a year before he’d be there I’d have said they were mad.“They told me really late in the summer that I could go but, at that point, a lot of teams already had their squads signed up.“There was a chance to go to Hibs but they brought in Didier Agathe from Raith Rovers and it ended up being too late for me. It felt like the goalposts had moved.“I eventually dropped down a ision on loan to Ayr in October because I couldn’t go on loan to another Premier League team.“I imagineI had dug my heels in about it all, I maybe wouldn’t have played for a whole year.“Ideally I wanted to continue playing at Dundee and play in semi-finals or finals because I knew what it would mean for the club and the fans.”He added: “For a while I was maybe not quite bitter but disappointed at the way things went. With a bit more time and experience you start to understand clubs do certain things.“I enjoyed it at Dundee, people always ask about the way things ended but it’s blown out of proportion really.“I bump into Peter Marr quite a lot actually and it all doesn’t matter now. I would have loved to have played another ,  games but it wasn’t to be.”Boyack would only play  times for Ayr before Craig Levein snapped him up for Hearts in a £, deal.He made  appearances in three years at Tynecastle. His most consistent football, however, was played at Dens Park under Jocky Scott.Now working in the construction and engineering trade, he says some of his best moments in the game came during his stint in the City of Discovery.“My best memories include my first derby. I remember walking across the road to Tannadice, I’d never done anything like that before.“It’s funny, you always remember the games you did better in! Big Brian Irvine scored, that was great for the big man, then I played in James Grady to get the winner and we won -.“I also remember going to Ibrox and winning. Rangers were flying at that point, seriously flying.“They’d just beaten Dortmund a few days before. My mates were saying we were in for a hiding and I didn’t disagree.“But they didn’t turn up and Gav Rae popped up in the last minute. I don’t know how many times Dundee have won at Ibrox but that was a great time.“And we were at a supporter’s do that night too. On the road down some of the boys were saying it was the worst time to have that, coming back from a game at Ibroxwe got stuffed.“Turns out it wasn’t a bad night after all!”Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans\" title\"#Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kane-hemmings-says-decision embed # secretqvAoqpAp\" data-secret\"qvAoqpAp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They spoke highly of the league and said they think I could come and do well.“Man City hold Scotland in high regard, as they should. City are very good, they’re in contact a lot.“They spoke to me at the weekend after the game and are always looking come and visit.”Of potentially facing Frimpong at Tannadice when Celtic call in a week on Saturday, Bolton continued: “It should be good.“If I’m picked and he plays on my side then it’ll be a good battle.“He’s a year below me so we’ve kind of grown up together, we were at the same school with all the City lads.“I’ve seen him grow up and have played with him over the years. He’s a good lad.“There’s no fakeness with him, he’s just a down to earth lad. He’s done really well.“Fair play to him because he’s taken his opportunity and, obviously, I’m hoping to do the same here.“Patrick Roberts is another who did well in Scotland and, like I said, City are keen to use the league as a playground for their loan stars.“Long may it continue. It’s brought people on that have previously done it.”Although they had no prior relationship, Bolton insists Tangerines boss Micky Mellon was also a major factor in him joining the club.“My agent had spoken to the manager before me and said he spoke really well,” the City kid added.“I’ve also had a few people I know tell me he’s a great manager and, after speaking to him, I got along with him and believed in what he wanted to do.“I’m really enjoying it, to be fair.“The lads are great with me and I’m enjoying working with the manager and being in a new league.“There’s a lot of exposure to the league, which is good for my personal profile, but obviously I spoke to the manager about his plans, too.“We’ve shown so far that we’re an established Premiership team and we back ourselves.“I couldn’t turn it down. He spoke well of the club and the city so it was easy.”Bolton has no in-depth knowledge of Scottish football but insists he is learning every week.After a spell on loan at Luton Town last term, he believes the Premiership is somewhat comparable to the English second tier.Bolton commented: “Obviously I’d watched Scottish football for years, all the Old Firm games and cup matches on Sky but knowing the actual league in and out, not too much.“I’m learning week in, week out the dferences and stuff like that.“It’s very similar to the Championship down south but what I would say is here it’s mph.“It’s end to end, and the Championship in England is known for that, but I think it’s even more so here.“All the teams you go up against are fit and will run constantly. It’s about adapting to that and I think I’m doing so.“I feel like we play some good football and mix it up at times but, obviously, in every league you come up against teams that want to go long and some teams that want to play the ball.“They’re very similar in that sense.”Dundee United manager Micky Mellon says Hibs# goal at Tannadice last night was offside as he delivers injury update on Lawrence Shankland\" title\"#Dundee United manager Micky Mellon says Hibs# goal at Tannadice last night was offside as he delivers injury update on Lawrence Shankland# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-micky-mellon-hibs-offside-lawrence-shankland embed # secretFLLuDSKvL\" data-secret\"FLLuDSKvL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

To the best of my knowledge, he#s not a member of the SNP.#I can#t interrogate how people vote and nor should I interrogate how people vote. It#s a personal choice.#Nicola Sturgeon added that recent polls, which predict an SNP landslide at the next Holyrood election, could create an #issue#these iniduals are barred from holding appointments based on their qualications.She said: #On the basis of current opinion polls, more than half of all the Scottish population intend to vote SNP so there would obviously be an issuewe started to exclude people who have qualications to do things from doing these things because they might vote SNP.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#I don#t think it should be relevant in terms of somebody#s ability to do a particular job that needs a particular specialism, which I don#t think anybody doubts Mark Priestley has.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#First Minister Nicola SturgeonThe academic came under fire after the Daily Record revealed tweets he posted ahead of the last general election, in December, one of which stated that the #clear# message in some seats was #vote SNP or get a Tory#.He also tweeted that supporting Neale Hanvey, a candidate who was suspended by the SNP amid an anti-Semitism row, before being readmitted to sit as an SNP MP in June, was perhaps a #lesser of two evils#.Education Secretary John Swinney announced Prof Priestley#s appointment during a statement in which he also apologised to pupils directly affected by the downgrading of awards. Mr Swinney said that it was #deeply regrettable we got this wrong# and announced all downgraded results would be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates.He also told parliament that the government hoped to learn lessons for the future and said the review led by Prof Priestley would provide initial findings within five weeks.Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said Scottish parents and pupils demand a #truly neutral and fully independent review# into the exams debacle.#If the SNP are serious about righting their wrongs over the fiasco, andthe public are to have any faith in this review, they must consider removing Mr Priestley#, he added.Prof Priestley has been approached for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

If you#re going to one pub where there is a transmission risk and immediately going to another, you are quickly spreading that risk and making that greater than it would otherwise be.#Visiting lots of pubs in a single day or evening massively increases the workload of test and protect, so please think about that # it makes a really big dferenceyou stay in one pub.#There will be further restrictions on hospitality venues, banning queuing both inside and out except for takeaway products and for #unavoidable# safety reasons.Speaking during Friday#s Scottish Government briefing, Prof Leitch said Melbourne provides the #best recent example#, citing that it took four weeks of a six-week lockdown in order to #bend the curve# of infection.He added that while the curve has #slowed# in Grampian, the rate of infection has not yet begun to fall in terms of an overall trend.Scotland#s national clinical director added: #I am not surprised we are still seeing numbers related to this Aberdeen cluster and I#m hopeful as we see that de-acceleration we will then see that curve bend in the next week to  days but I cannot guarantee it so that#s why we continue with lockdown restrictions.#A total of  cases have been identied in Grampian since July  and  cases have so far been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak associated with pubs and other nearby venues, with , close contacts being identied so far.The NHS Grampian area accounted for  of the  new confirmed cases in Scotland overnight, taking the total to , across Scotland, with a further two cases attributed to an outbreak in Orkney.The First Minister also confirmed that nine cases were recorded in Glasgow and a further  in North Lanarkshire, related to a cluster in north-east Glasgow.When askedAberdeen could see its lockdown measures extended for a third week, the First Minister said: #All I can say is, I can#t rule that out but I hope we#ll be able to lt these restrictions as soon as possible.#We will formally review them next Wednesday and give the outcome of that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

If you#re going to one pub where there is a transmission risk and immediately going to another, you are quickly spreading that risk and making that greater than it would otherwise be.#Visiting lots of pubs in a single day or evening massively increases the workload of test and protect, so please think about that # it makes a really big dferenceyou stay in one pub.#There will be further restrictions on hospitality venues, banning queuing both inside and out except for takeaway products and for #unavoidable# safety reasons.Speaking during Friday#s Scottish Government briefing, Prof Leitch said Melbourne provides the #best recent example#, citing that it took four weeks of a six-week lockdown in order to #bend the curve# of infection.He added that while the curve has #slowed# in Grampian, the rate of infection has not yet begun to fall in terms of an overall trend.Scotland#s national clinical director added: #I am not surprised we are still seeing numbers related to this Aberdeen cluster and I#m hopeful as we see that de-acceleration we will then see that curve bend in the next week to  days but I cannot guarantee it so that#s why we continue with lockdown restrictions.#A total of  cases have been identied in Grampian since July  and  cases have so far been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak associated with pubs and other nearby venues, with , close contacts being identied so far.The NHS Grampian area accounted for  of the  new confirmed cases in Scotland overnight, taking the total to , across Scotland, with a further two cases attributed to an outbreak in Orkney.The First Minister also confirmed that nine cases were recorded in Glasgow and a further  in North Lanarkshire, related to a cluster in north-east Glasgow.When askedAberdeen could see its lockdown measures extended for a third week, the First Minister said: #All I can say is, I can#t rule that out but I hope we#ll be able to lt these restrictions as soon as possible.#We will formally review them next Wednesday and give the outcome of that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business.

But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

He lost consciousness.When Taylor awoke, disorientated and with a throbbing headache, the objects were gone.His trousers were ripped in peculiar fashion, and there were grazes on his legs and chin.Robert Taylor witnessed a huge flying dome near Dechmont Law in West Lothian on November , Police who accompanied Taylor back to the site found \"ladder-shaped marks\" in the soil where the craft was said to have hovered, and further marks following the path of the mine-like objects.While it would later be suggested that he had suffered an epileptic seizure, mini-stroke or hallucinated after ingesting deadly nightshade berries, Taylor, who died in , never sought publicity or financial gain ndash and always stood by every word of his account.The case remains unique in British history as the only example of a UFO sighting becoming the subject of a criminal investigation.The Falkirk Triangle: Scotlands UFO capitalThe phenomenon known as the \"Falkirk Triangle\" ndash which includes Bonnybridge and Camelon ndash first began to gain attention in  with the area laying claim to around  sightings a year.A family out for a walk on a March evening in  spoke of witnessing a basketball-sized blue light hovering on the back road from Hallglen to Bonnybridge and claimed to hear a sound similar to a \"door opening\" followed by a \"howl\" .A video of an orange oval light above Falkirk, changing shape to becoming a white disc ndash the classic \"flying saucer\" shape ndash then disappearing suddenly was captured in October .

And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change. We dont want you to be hopeful on our behalf, we want you to be active on our behalfrsquo.He concludes: \"Would you not be annoyedyou were a young person who was suddenly confronted by the reality of climate change ldquoOnly to hear politicians say, Well, its dficult to address this, I think this is a challenge for future generations.\"It makes me feel pretty mad even at the advanced age of , when I hear politicians talking like that ndash its so complacent, its so self-indulgent, its so contemptuous of the interests of young people today.\"To see in Jonathon Porritt in conversation with journalist and broadcaster Sheena McDonald, go to bordersbookfestival.org online-event jonathon-porritt-hope-in-hellThe Borders Book Festival is sponsored by Baillie Gford."},{"url":null,"title":"craig-lowrie-completes-fundraiser-memory-late-sister","story":"GALASHIELS man Craig Lowrie has completed his fundraising challenge ndash and he says the donations total is ldquounbelievable.Mr Lowrie has now run a dozen km runs during the Border summer festival season, having completed his final event in Coldstream on Friday .\"It was always going to be an emotional run as it was the last one,\" said Mr Lowrie, of Selkirk, whose son Robbie was last yearrsquos Braw Lad in Galashiels.The challenge was created after this yearrsquos festivals were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.Around pound, has been raised, according to Mr Lowrie, with the money going to the festival committees, as well as the Borders General Hospital.However, Mr Lowrie dedicated his efforts to his late sister, Donna Cameron, of Innerleithen, who died in a road collision last year, just two weeks before her nephews appearance as Braw Lad.Following the completion of the runs, Mr Lowrie said: \"It was good to get them finished ndash the running was the easy bit.Reflecting on Fridayrsquos event, he added: \"My sisters kids and husband were coming down, and apart from Innerleithen they had not been to any of the other runs.\"Mr Lowrie was due to be joined by his son in Coldstream, but Robbie had an injury which left him on crutches.But Mr Lowrie didnt run his last challenge alone ndash former Selkirk Standard Bearer Rory Monks joined in.\"Rory stepped forward to run with me,\" said Mr Lowrie. \"I was glad to have the company as on my own it would have been gruelling.\"At the time of going to print, Mr Lowrie estimated that his fundraiser had reached a total of around pound, - with just over pound, being raised through his online Go Fund Me page.\"Its phenomenal, said Mr Lowrie. \"I sat with Robbie at the beginning of the summer to talk about it.\"I didnt expect anything near what weve done ndash its unbelievable.\"Once he had completed his mammoth task, racking up more  kilometres across the summer, Mr Lowrie gave a speech to supporters through a Facebook livestream.In his speech, Mr Lowrie said: \"Especially in these uncertain times we live in, you made the dference ndash I only ran.\"The comments you guys have posted each week ndash some heartfelt, some really encouraging, some quite funny ndash all really did mean a lot to me and gave me a great sense of pride.\"To support Craig Lowries fundraiser, visit his Go Fund Me page."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-pavilion-cinema-reveals-date-reopening","story":"THE Pavilion Cinema in Galashiels will reopen to the public next week.The Market Street venue has been closed for the last five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.But film lovers will be able tonext Friday .Cinema manager Andrew Poole said: ldquoThe past few months have been the longest and hardest in our familyrsquos  years in running cinemas.\"But we have survived and we are ready to reopen, albeit under extraordinarily dficult conditions.\"When we reopen, we will have a range of measures in place to protect our customers including fewer performances to allow deeper cleaning of halls between shows, one-way systems at the concessions stand, perspex screens, hand sanitiser stations throughout the building and we will be adhering to the physical distancing rules in place at that time.\"We are able to ensure our customers are sat two metres apart in the cinema hall using our booking system.\"All customers are encouraged to book in advance, but tickets will be available at the cinema.\"Classic films will be shown at first, before Christopher Nolans Tenetis screened on August .Mr Poole added: \"Films such as Peter Rabbit, Jumanji, The Greatest Showmanand Harry Potterwill play alongside Disneyrsquos Onwardwhich had only been showing for a week before we closed.\"We will also be showing Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, currently celebrating its th anniversary.\"We havenrsquot been idle during lockdown.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.There are right and wrong ways to store your food. For example, some food must be refrigerated while other types need to be kept at room temperature.Some cooking oils are fine on the countertop, and others should be stored in the fridge.Even some of your expired foods arenrsquot really expired, and you might be using the wrong containers. With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket.. Youre using plastic wrap to save your leftoversBees Wrap can be used to store anything from biscuits to sandwiches. But not soup... yet.

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Eerie comparisons with Covid asideJulias observations on the odds pregnant women in poverty already face, and the havoc wreaked on their bodies from having too many children, too young, is devastating - and fascinating - to read.Donoghue deftly weaves in politics, policy, the impact of war, feminism, violence and the minutiae of changing bed pans and sterilising instruments, while dealing with dismissive male doctors and birthing babies.

Gravel gardens can make it look like a beach,\" says Cha Gold medallist Perkins, whose  Facebook show garden Growing The Future will be displayed at next years show.\"You could do worse than put down four or five inches of gravel, and many seaside plants would be happy growing in it. If you have poor drainage or heavy soil, build up a gravel layer, adding sand or soil to add nutrients.:Letters: When it comes to language, lets live and let live\"A lot of coastal plants will be perfectly happy growing into that layer and many of them dont need much soil, andthey do, like sea kale, they will have a deep tap root which theyll send down to stabilise themselves.\"\"Treat your seaside garden like an alpine garden,\" says Talbot. \"You want free-draining soil, which you can build up like a rockery or clf face, incorporating shorter grasses like carex or small miscanthus, to give you the feel of the wispy grasses along the edge of the shoreline.\"Pick suitable plants\"If you like the spartan look, you could make a gravel garden planted with rivers of thyme, dwarf myrtle bushes and some evening primrose coming through it.\"Stock up on free-draining species\"Other good plants to create a sea feel would include santolinas, lavenders, silver-leaf plants and some sea poppies, which need to be planted in a very free-draining, gritty soil, with a good sand and compost mix because they dont like being in a very fertile garden. Known as the horned poppy, these perennials have lemon flowers and large, bean-like seed heads,\" continues Talbot.:Herald Diary: Getting to grips with a Titanic struggle\"Thrtis another good choice and comes in colours from white to darkish red. You can buy any of the Ballerina Series in the alpine section of a local nursery.\" She also recommends sea holly , sedums, artemisia and mallows.For border colour, you could go with acanthus, euphorbias, Phlomis russelianaand valerian , erigeronand low-growing herbs such as thyme, lavender and rosemary, Perkins suggests.Add seaside accessories\"Create a small area with some shingle and put some posts on the side, with a rope link between them or some firemens buckets or tyres or rings which could be painted red to resemble lebuoys, or get some glass fishermens jars. You might be able to get hold of some crayfish or lobster baskets, which give an area a nice seaside feel,\" Talbot advises.\"Thick ropes, which you often see tying a boat to a mooring, are a great accessory. You can get a garden-sized boat and plant that up, putting it on a small shingle bed, with alpine grit over the top to finish.\"Display beach finds carefullyPerkins says you have to be careful when putting shells or drtwood youve found on beach-combing walks on display at random points in the garden. \"Instead of dotting things around, make a display cabinet of perhaps a series of shells, which makes sense of them being there.\"Create a beach-inspired social spot\"For me, being on the beach is about getting together in the evening and relaxed social gatherings, so I would think about fire pits, deck chairs and that sort of low-slung seating you can really relax into. Fire pits are great, whether you choose gas or wood fire,\" Perkins observes.Hammocks and outdoor bean bags could also be added to create that beach feel, he suggests."},{"url":null,"title":"travel-royal-family-retreats-scotland-every-year","story":"Travel: This is why the Royal Family retreats to Scotland every yearUndated Handout Photo of the Morrone Birkwood trail.

WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature TRAVEL Braemar.The Aberdeen-born poet and writer, whose face now adorns the Scottish pound note, made it her les quest to find the \"essential nature\" of the Cairngorms. In the process of exploring its graceful, gleaming rivers and high plateaus \"as delectable as honey\", she discovered a lot about herself too.Twice the size of the Lake District, East Scotlands Cairngorms National Park is a wilderness area of crisp, clear lochs, ancient forests and glens bristling with vibrant purple heather. Promising calm, quiet and the freedom of space, it seemed an obvious choice for a post-lockdown adventure with my mum, Gabriella.Aged over  and recovering from heart surgery, my mum had been shielding since March. Im not a fan of Zoom or FaceTime, so when we met at Heathrow airport to catch our flight to Aberdeen, it was the first time Id seen her in four months.In a world where every move seems to be dominated by Covid-, the decision to travel isnt an easy one to make at any age. But as days disappear and months march on, theres an urgency to get moving. Ive never really understood why time accelerates with age. The harder we grip, the more it slips away. Maybe its the realisation that everything is finite, including us.Then there was the risk of being indefinitely confined by anxiety.\"If I dont go out soon, Ill never have the confidence,\" my mum confessed.So, armed with face masks, sanitiser and a sensible degree of caution, we refused to be beaten by fear.Nan chose to camp her way around the Cairngorms. But weve opted for a greater degree of comfort at the Fe Arms, a regal Victorian property in the village of Braemar on the banks of the River Clunie, matched in magnicence to its surrounding mountain landscape.After having our temperatures checked, were ushered inside by the hotels welcoming ghillies who apologise profusely for the impersonality of Perspex  on reception, visors and the absence of Fes bespoke tartan blankets in rooms.Scotland only recently emerged from lockdown on July , and the hotel Is quickly adapting to a new and unfamiliar way of working. Rooms are deep cleaned between guests, breakfast buffets have been ditched in favour of timed sittings, and a one-way system is in place throughout the property.Otherwise, it all feels refreshingly normal.Owned by art dealers Iwan and Manuela Wirth , who breathed new le into its rundown shell and re-opened in , the Fe is filled with , artworks, antiques and collectables.When youve been indoors for so long, everything has a new and shiny appeal. But here in this Disneyland of culture and creativity, my mum has the wide-eyed wonder of a child embracing infinity and beyond.Paying homage to Braemars Victorian roots, furnishings reflect the grandeur of that time: an ornately carved walnut wood fireplace depicting works by Scottish poet Robert Burns dominates the reception chairs upholstered in Liberty fabrics decorate the drawing room and natural history specimens are displayed in curiosity cabinets, or used to create whimsical tableaux in bell jars. Not to everyones modern PC tastes, one corridor alone has  pieces of taxidermy, upstaged only by an eery waxwork model of Queen Victoria in the library, purchased from Madame Tussauds.If a wall of stags heads is isive, modern artworks incorporating antlers are pleasingly palatable: hanging above the main staircase, Richard Jacksons Red Deer Chandelier is a tangle of neon bagpipe drones and glass antlers.From outspoken sculptures to understated sketches, every corner of the Fe is covered in conversation-provoking art.Works by Picasso, Brueghel The Younger and Man Ray hang on walls one of Louise Bourgeois bronze spiders straddles the courtyard. But an even more impressive find are some watercolours of royal estates painted by Prince Charles and a sketch by Queen Victoria of a stag shot by her close confidant John Brown.Braemars relationship with royalty reaches back to  when Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Estate for his sovereign we. \"She was passionate about this place,\" Katy Fennema of Braemar Highland Experience tells me. The former musician, whose family have  years of history in the area, now runs local history, wilderness and wildle tours with her husband, Julian.During a morning driving tour, she shares tales of brigands hung from tree boughs, and delights in stories of Chanels fashion rival Elsa Schiaparelli, who became fascinated with Braemar when her friend, Vogue editor Frances Lovell Oldham, married a laird. The two ladies would literally go on to paint parts of the town shocking pink, and an art deco bar at the Fe is named after Elsa.Much of the land here has been shaped by aristocracy. Patchworks of charred heather on the hillside are the remnants of controlled burns, used to boost a grouse population in time for shoots.Yet so much remains wild. Along the Queens Drive walking trail, trees are laden with tufty beards of lichen, an indicator of the airs purity.At .am one morning, mum and I ramble through the Morrone Birkwood, a relic of deciduous woodland that once covered the Cairngorms. On the way up, we watch hares and red squirrels scamper through a stadium used to host the Braemar Gathering, one of the most popular Highland Games. And we detour past the house where Robert Louis Stephenson spent a miserable, rainy three months in , emerging with the first  chapters of Treasure Island.Its a very dferent scene today. Sunlight splinters through gate pickets as we clamber onto a trail scattered with pinecones. Streams trickle melodically from the mountainside and the scent of honeysuckle is dizzying.Juniper, blaeberries, meadowsweet and yarrow - so many plants thrive in this healthy environment. Later in the day, herbalist and forager Natasha Lloyd introduces us to her open-air medicine cabinet. She recommends treatments for my mums liver, and I learn how to eat a raw nettle without getting stung. The common nettle is packed with Vitamin D, which may boost the immune system against respiratory viruses such as Covid-.Fortunately, there were no cases of coronavirus in Braemar. Although one famous figure down the road made headlines: Prince Charles self-isolated at Balmoral when he fell ill at the beginning of lockdown.Its easy to see why the royals come here to escape and recuperate. This month, the Queen will arrive for her annual summer holiday. We follow one of her favourite trails through the Ballochbuie Forest, a protected tract of -year-old pines saved from felling by Queen Victoria, leading to the Honka Hut - a simple cabin where Elizabeth II likes to picnic.In the past, hikers claim to have \"run-into\" Her Royal Highness walking the corgis, but blissfully, we dont see a soul.It was silence and solitude that guided Nan Shepherd into the mountains. Similarly, it helps my mum readjust to an outside world fraught with complications, but beautul at its core.How to plan your tripRooms at the Fe Arms start from poundin a Croft Room.

Everyone wins. And all shall have prizes.:IndyRef: New poll shows % would back independence as SNP set for record Holyrood majorityMind you, I dont think Mr Swinney will be interfering in many future examinations. I cant think of any ministerial U-turn that has been quite as humiliating as this one. Not least because Mr Swinney spent half of his statement defending the very moderation system that he had just discarded.No serious government can conduct its business in this way. Mr Swinney gave no principled explanation of why he was abandoning the work of the supposedly independent SQA ndash other than that a number young people felt that the system was unjust. That is undeniably true and we all felt for them.But this capitulation leaves the SQA in an impossible position, and brings the whole examination process into question. Indeed, I dont see how the SQA can continue in its present form. Certainly, it cannot conduct its normal moderation of exam results with any confidence in future years.And nor can Mr Swinney. He must surely go now, after this fiasco, and without delay. Someone must come in to restore respect for the standards in Scottish education and serve the last rites on the Qualications Authority.Indeed, standardised assessment through competitive examinations looks to have had its day. As Mr Swinney hinted, it has become increasingly unpopular in recent years. Though every country including Finland, the leading edge of pedagogical progressivism, uses objective testing.But after this fiasco, examinations like the Highers will surely lose their unique status and will likely be supplanted by teacher estimates of ability which, according to Mr Swinney, is the most reliable way to gauge academic achievement. This, even though he himself concedes that in the past teacher assessment has been no reliable guide to exam performance.The impact on grade inflation will be as the First Minister herself forecast last week ldquoincredible. A % increase in Highers grades means that this years students will forever be marked out as the year when exam credibility went out the window.Whoever called the process by which the Scottish Qualication Authority adjusts exam scores to reflect past school performance ldquomoderation had a dry sense of humour. It has caused fury amongst teachers, pupils, parents.The anger shows no sign of moderating even after Swinneys desperate attempt to put a lid on the worst exam crisis in  years. This was a statement that was as humiliating as it was self-contradictory.:UK falls into recession after lockdown sees record contractionHe began by explaining atwhy the moderation applied by the SQA did not disproportionately downgrade students from deprived areas, as has been widely claimed. This is because the grade inflation, against historic standards, was higher in schools in these areas, at %, than in schools in more prosperous areas, which inflated by only around %. Greater moderation was therefore applied out of fairness, not classism.He then commended the SQAs ldquoopen and transparent adjustment methodology and insisted that it was ldquoin use throughout the UK and across the world\". But, er, not in Scotland any more. Mr Swinney then let the algorithmic cat out of the bag by pointing out that exam moderation happens every year to some extent as the SQA, and its English equivalent Ofqual, manipulate grade boundaries. But not presumably in future.He even announced, solemnly, that the remit of the SQAwas to ensure that every student got ldquothe qualications they deserved. The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another. They may have got the grades they and their teachers wanted, but those grades will forever be tainted by the chaotic and unprincipled way in which they were awarded.

with lyrics perfectly capturing the feel of obsessive young relationships: Sometimes all I think about is you  Late nights in the middle of June.Big electronic drum beats feature throughout the album but a whimsical, nostalgic vibe creeps in through lighter synths and twanging guitar on the title track Dreamland, and Melon And The Coconut.A standout track is Your Love , released back in February, which pays tribute to the production styles of Justin Timberlake and Missy Elliot with its driving beat and dance-y melody.As well as being rammed with enormous tunes, the wistful, throwback lyrics make Dreamland an apt and strong contender for one of the major sounds of an unconventional summer.Mike BediganMADE OF RAINTHE PSYCHEDELIC FURSMade Of Rain, the first album from The Psychedelic Furs in  years, proves the new wave darlings havent lost their edge.In recent years the group have reformed on a semi-regular basis to play live dates.But they said they had begun to \"feel like a jukebox\" and set about writing new material to bolster their sets.The Furs sported a rotating line-up throughout the s, anchored by the presence of brothers Richard and Tim Butler.They released a cluster of seminal records including s Mirror Moves but towards the end of the decade the quality began to drop off.Made Of Rain recaptures some of the heady glamour of their early albums, and a fair dose of their swagger.It is also a markedly darker affair ndash and thats saying something for the band that inspired The Horrors and Interpol.Pounding drums, soaring synths and brooding vocals are all present, but most importantly, the songs are just excellent.Alex GreenWASHED OUTPURPLE NOONA decade on from the heyday of the microgenre known as chillwave, Atlantas Ernest Greene s with his fourth album as Washed Out.Opening track Too Late sounds instantly familiar, mid-tempo, muffled vocals conveying a vague sense of unease and regret, s drums, washes of synths.With the shock of the new long gone, this laid-back, tasteful sound seems more like yacht rock than the cutting edge, and can easily blend into the background.Chillwave always tends to be described as summertime music, hazy and shimmering, and, listening during a heatwave, Purple Noon ticks all those boxes - the title comes from the sunbaked Mediterranean  film based on The Talented Mr Ripley.The single Time To Walk Away isfaster and insidiously catchy, the sort of earworm that re-emerges days later with you wondering what it is, and how it got there.But too many of the tracks struggle to hold the attention, with Greenes -year journey from scratchy lo-fi to polished textures inspired by Sade and Phil Collins ending in a bland cul-de-sac.Matthew GeorgeJON ANDERSON, HANDSJon Andersons latest solo album,you can call it that, has been a long time in the making.Originally conceived  years ago during a songwriting retreat in Calornias Big Bear Mountain area, the original tapes were left to languish in Andersons garage.But two years ago the co-founder and former lead singer of progressive rock pioneers Yes was approached by producer Michael Franklin who had enough capital to complete the project.Anderson recruited a bevvy of friends, admirers and personal heroes to work on the tracks, including Jethro Tulls Ian Anderson and pianist Chick Corea .It also features archive recordings from Andersons former Yes bandmates - drummer Alan White and bassist Chris Squire, the latter having died in  from a rare form of leukaemia.Theres prog-rock wig-outs in Activate and Come Up, while First Born Leaders delivers reggae rhythms with a hallucinogenic edge.Andersons brand of prog-rock, psychedelia and world music may no longer be cool, hip or even groovy, but his magnetic charm and free-wheeling musicality is enough to lend , Hands some weight.Alex GreenLAYLA KAYLIFLOVERS DONT MEETBritish singer-songwriter Layla Kayl draws on Shakespeare, the work of th century Persian poet Rumi and US country music on her latest album.Sound like a lot, right  But at seven tracks, Lovers Dont Meet is short and sweet.Kayls voice is warm and graceful and the guitar work simple and direct.Its a heady mix and one that benefits from the pleasing production she secured during recording sessions in Nashville with producer Jason Hall.Lovers Dont Meet pays homage to a genre Kayl has always loved, but it fails to replicate the soul or substance of true country music.Instead, Kayl fills up the album with references - to the queen of country Dolly Parton on Dont You Know Me Yet  and th century Syrian writer Nizar Qabbani on As I Am.The result is a little messy, but enjoyable nonetheless.Alex Green"},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-business-needs-support-preventing-covid-spikes","story":"AS Aberdeen residents and businesses weather the cityrsquos second lockdown, itrsquos time for fresh thinking on how we manage the Covid- challenge to protect public health and prevent further damage to the economy.Further lockdowns are devastating to peoplersquos livelihoods, destroying businesses and adversely impacting on any hope for a short-term economic recovery, and must be avoided at all cost. While the Scottish Government, which is ultimately responsible for safeguarding public health, has a major role to play, I believe businesses are better placed to make things happen and to do so far more quickly.The best way forward should involve a new approach with business taking the lead to implement greater safety measures with the support of government and other public sector bodies.This will start with business owners and managers stepping up and being more proactive in ensuring they operate within a safer framework to stop the spread of this virus. As well as providing a clean and safe environment for their customers at all times, they will also need to consider implementing other creative measures and better utilising existing technology.We are already seeing a number of examples of this across the globe where businesses are driving forward on-the-ground initiatives to reduce the risk of a further lockdown. Restaurants in Kinsale, in County Cork, Ireland have, for example, begun testing the temperatures of all their customers upon entry. Meanwhile Tourism Portugal has introduced ldquoSafe  Clean certication which enables participating hotels to provide the reassurance they have undertaken the appropriate level of disinfecting and have made hand sanitiser available to guests throughout their stay. Even McDonaldrsquos has gone beyond government guidelines by making the wearing of masks mandatory for all customers entering any of their , US restaurants.While businesses in Aberdeen and throughout Scotland should be taking the lead in bringing new and effective measures to fruition, the support of the Scottish Government will be essential as well as beneficial. Agencies including Scottish Enterprise, where we have made initial representations on this issue, could provide grants and other support measures. This could help many hard-pressed businesses put temperature monitoring devices for both staff and customers as well as other facilities in place at a time when the strain on their finances may otherwise prevent such expenditure. This would put even more pressure on the public purse, but it would be a sensible investmentit prevents the economic carnage that comes from further lockdowns.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos leadership has been solid throughout much of this pandemic.

We await the Governmentrsquos response. This week Labour also called for the licensing of grouse shooting after a big increase in the illegal killing of birds during the lockdown.But in Scotland, Irsquom afraid, the signs of progress are not good. For a start, the Werritty report was based on the flawed premise that driven grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Werritty was explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors could continue to be a part of the economy instead of questioning whether Scotlandrsquos countryside should tolerate a business that harms the countryside ndash through the burning of heather, for example.The reportrsquos conclusion on licensing also ended up being rather limp because the group that led the report was ided, which meant the compromise of suggesting a licensing systemthere is no improvement in bird of prey populations. Which gives the Scottish Government a get-out: wersquore waiting, theyrsquoll say, to seetherersquos been an improvement hellip still waiting hellip still waiting. The Government has also shown a lack of urgency in responding to Werritty. It does not look good.There are also serious question marks over whether licensing will work. First off, the people who are illegally killing birds of prey are unlikely to be deterred by a licensing systemtheyrsquore not deterred by the law as it stands Scotland for more than  years.Therersquos also a danger thatan ineffective licensing system will be introduced and then everything will just carry on as normal. I spoke to the conservationist Mark Avery about this recently and his view was that the whole idea of licensing depended on how robust the system was a weak one would pretty much allow the wildle criminals to carry on regardless.Some people in the shooting community feel theyrsquore being unfairly singled out over this. I remember speaking to one guy who runs a training school for gundogs who said he was frustrated that certain ways of killing animals ndash fishing for example ndash were seen as socially acceptable whereas shooting had a stigma attached to it. A farrier also told me that at least shooting enthusiasts are being honest about killing animals ndash townies on the other hand will happily tuck into burgers and fish and chips and yet judge people for shooting birds or deer.In some ways, I can see where the country sports enthusiasts are coming from on that one ndash for most of us, grouse shooting is a weird and distant practice and maybe that makes it easier to support moves to control it. But fishing doesnrsquot involve killing every other species in the water, whereas the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one thatrsquos devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.That is the key to the problem: a model that is effectively based on the killing of birds of prey. Perhaps licensing can do something to improve it. I hope so. Perhaps the Government will support licensing. I hope for that too. But it may be that it all rests on a simple question. Mark Thomas of the RSPB said this week that most of the bird of prey deaths theyrsquod seen during lockdown were linked in some way to shooting. So the question is: will licensing change the behaviour of those people  Or do we have to go further and ban driven grouse shooting completely Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We are in a war. Not a war against another nation, or a terrorist entity, but a war against a virus. And just as when we emerged from great wars, we took the opportunity to do things dferently, we must do the same now.The impact of coronavirus has been so severe, the consequences so profound, that we have an obligation on behalf of our people to exploit any silver lining we can possibly find in the enormous cloud which hovers above us.This can be a time of total national renewal. A time to hit the reset button across public le.I am no longer a party political player, and I have written in these pages on many occasions that I have found the SNP in government to be reliable and competent.Since its election in , a relatively small group of talented people have managed the country perfectly well, however the key word in this sentence is \"managed\". This has not been a radical government, and given the inevitability of its continuation until at least , we are all invested in that changing.In Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney, the country has two people who, due to the formerrsquos historic popularity, are almost uniquely placed to take the country with them whatever they decide to do. Leaving aside the independence issue, to leave a legacy worth remembering, it is time to throw caution to the wind.The obvious first, and probably most important example, is uppermost in our thoughts this week: education. Our focus currently is on an acute issue in the form of the exam results, just as a few months ago it was on the acute question of when children wouldto school. But those are snapshots, stories, symptoms.:Jobs guarantee for young Scots backed by poundm fundingThe real issue here is not the acute but the chronic we have a state school system which is inadequately preparing our children for the world which greets them when they leave. I have now acquired direct experience of this, with four children in the state school system.It is not hyperbolic to say that I have encountered almost nothing which has genuinely impressed me. We are living a lie in this country, blindly accepting old tropes about Scotland having a world-leading education system. We do not. It is unambitious, with very little encouragement of the pursuit of excellence. It is secretive, with decisions iniably favouring councils and unions at the expense of pupils and parents, who are often treated as an inconvenience. And it is iniquitous, with thosewho have been able to pay for a house in a good catchment area effectively purchasing a chance for our children to emerge unscathed.Education leads to economic success. Education leads to high tax receipts. Education leads to good health and wellbeing. Education reduces welfare dependency. Education is everything. But we are sleepwalking into a national catastrophe because we are too afraid to admit that we are struggling.Today, the education secretary John Swinney faces a confidence vote a trap laid by opposition smelling political blood. Fine Irsquom certain the SNP would do the samethe shoe was on the other foot. But Irsquom not interested in that. As a citizen I recognise that the SNP will be in power for the next term of government and I believe that Mr Swinney has the skill, knowledge and respect to lead a rethink of everything. Starting age. Term times. Class sizes. Curriculum. Everything. We are all invested in his success.This is true not only of education. When the story of Covid  is told, Irsquod put the mortgage on the NHS emerging from that story as the hero. The NHS, as has often been said, is this countryrsquos national religion, and the hysteria which accompanies any sceptical comment about its quality ensures that the only political intervention it attracts is no-strings-attached increases in funding.:Letters: This is the final nail in the coffin of our education systemThat is no longer acceptable. As we try to analyse, in Scotland and the UK, whether we have coped well with Covid  relative to our peers, to leave the NHS out of that discussion would be an act of national self-harm.There are facts here, and they sit stubbornly in the way of the narrative. Our NHS has  percent fewer doctors per head than the OECD average. We have barely half the average number of hospital beds per head. We have less than half the number of MRI scanners, and one-third the number of CT scanners per head.We scrape into the OECD top- for survival rates for major cancers ndash colorectal, breast and cervical. We perform even worse ndash outside the top  ndash in mortality rates for heart attack, haemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. And all of this is despite comparable financing of the system. Readers, we are not the envy of the world.This is not OK. We should stop thinking this is OK. We should stop saying this is OK. It demeans us to do so. You can support taxpayer-funded healthcare, as I do, and support the people who work in it, as I do , whilst also advocating a renewal of the delivery mechanism.However the critical first hurdle in a national renewal ndash the part we in Scotland have always found ourselves unable to leap ndash is to admit that we have problems. That we too often bask in our own mediocrity. So herersquos one idea. The Scottish Government should create a small National Renewal Unit. Give them a big travel budget.

There remains a widening gap between high-level rhetoric and delivery on the ground. However, there are a number of statements which suggest the government is beginning to give the necessary prominence to the role that investment in our natural environment can play in addressing the climate, nature and economic crises.In accepting the recommendations of its own Advisory Group on Economic Recovery, the Scottish Government is taking a new ldquofour capitals approach which involves viewing the economy through four pillars of economic, natural, human and social capital. Just as importantly, it is accepting the advice of the group ldquoto treat each pillar as equally important.Government recognises that improving our wellbeing is dependent on our ability to conserve and grow our natural assets. It also appears to have accepted the radical advice of the Scottish Infrastructure Commission that the next Infrastructure Investment Plan should have natural infrastructure as a key component.In other aspects the plan lacks urgency and clear time commitments. Much of the detail seems to have been left to the update of the Climate Change Plan and the Infrastructure Investment Plan. Sadly, a clear timetable is also lacking and all we are told is that there will be ldquoregular updates to the plan.There is welcome acknowledgement that investing in our natural environment, nature-based solutions and green skills are vital to address the twin climate and bioersity crises. Nonetheless, to be genuinely transformational government will need to go further than existing commendable commitments to peatland restoration and vague pledges of ldquowoodland expansion.Government must ensure that we also maintain our peatland in good condition, prevent further damaging extraction and horticultural use and invest in native woodland. Nature-based solutions must also go further and include investment in greening our cities and enhancing the marine environment.With the Scottish Budget already under signicant pressure, providing the necessary funding for nature-based solutions is going to be even more of a challenge. This cannot, however, be an excuse for further delay. Investment in our natural assets must get a fair share of the poundbn earmarked for infrastructure plans. We also need to consider how to make better use of existing funding and instruments like the infrastructure levy. The UK Committee on Climate Change has advised that we must also consider changes in tax policy. The Scottish National Investment Bank also has a key role to play.One low cost and high impact measure that could unlock a whole range of new conservation opportunities would be for the next Scottish Budget to kick start a new Conservation Finance Fund with initial public seed investment to help lever in private finance. This would build on the collaborative work led by SEPA and the Scottish Wildle Trust on the ldquoRoute Map to pound Billionrsquo.If the necessary public and private funding is forthcoming, then the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed partnership approach and the desire to involve communities much more in decision making is also key to success.

We want to see flexibility from the Chancellor so people arenrsquot pushed into unsustainable financial insecurity.ldquoThe Citizens Advice network in Scotland has seen a huge increase in demand for redundancy advice during the pandemic and we can only see that demand increasing in the months the ahead.\"Which  says that while payment holidays are not a long-term solution and it is in the best interests for consumers to repay where possible, there is likely to be a rise in the number of consumers falling into financial distress as a result of the furlough scheme ending who will need to access this support.It said lenders should offer wider \"forbearance options\" such as payment rescheduling or freezing interest when another deferral is not in the consumers best interest.The consumer organisation said it was too early toto existing forbearance rules - designed for those facing financial hardship - raising concerns that firms will be unable to offer tailored support to struggling customers.It also suggests that normal credit reference agency reporting rules should not immediately be applied after the October  deadline has passed.Anyone who has already accessed a payment holiday due to the extraordinary circumstances created by the pandemic - or who accesses one between now and January ,  - must not have their long-term creditworthiness negatively impacted as a result, it said.The timescales of forbearance complaints should be reduced so consumers can get urgent support when they need it, the consumer organisation added.Gareth Shaw, Head of Money at Which , said: ldquoThe regulator has acted quickly and effectively to help those struggling financially due to the pandemic, but it must be prepared to take further bold action to prevent millions of people from being hit by a perfect storm of financial pressures in the coming months.ldquoThe huge number of payment holidays taken highlights the scale of financial dficulty people in this country are facing - a situation that is likely to become worse as support measures like the furlough scheme come to an end.ldquoThe regulator must treat all consumers fairly - ensuring financial support is still provided to those who need it and also available for those who may face financial problems for the first time after October .The number of people in work in Scotland fell by , between April and June as the impact of lockdown hit, according to the latest figures show.The proportion of people aged  to  in employment north of the border fell over the quarter to .% , data from the Office for National Statisticsindicates.The unemployment rate rose over that period to . per cent with , people out of work.

Meetings also donrsquot have to be registeredldquofactual information or views on a topic were requested by ministers or MSPs.Members of the Scottish Alliance for Lobbying Transparencywhich includes groups like Transparency International and the Electoral Reform Society ndash have made their concerns known to policy makers to mark two years since the Scottish Lobbying Register was introduced.So far this year the number of reported regulated lobbying engagements has slumped by a quarter from  last year to just  this year.With the numbers slumping in particular during the lockdown, the campaigners fear this is simply because lobbyists are moving from in-person meetings to \"undeclared phone calls and written materials\" in the run up to next yearrsquos elections.In February alone, before the coronavirus lockdown, the number of reported regulated lobbying engagements dropped by half from  last year to just  in .An analysis of the lobbying register between March, last year and July, this year found that most lobbying of Scottish ministers has been carried out by big businesses and farmers.Ten of the top  lobbyists over the last two years represented private vested interests. They included major companies, salmon farming multinationals, supermarkets, the whisky industry and landowners.The most frequent ministerial lobbyist by far was the Confederation of British Industryin Scotland, which says it speaks for , UK businesses. The second biggest was the National Farmers Union in Scotland , which represents over , farmers.Campaigners say Scotland is \"noticeably out of step with other major Western democracies\" such as the Republic of Ireland, Canada and even Westminster, which record oral and written communications as lobbying.And unlike lobbying transparency registers in the EU and US, Scotlandrsquos does not provide any information about the amount spent on relevant activities by those seeking to influence key decisions.The campaigners say that gives the impression that there is equal opportunity for organisations and groups to present their views to ministers and MSPs when there might be a substantial disparity in their resources.That comes against a background of growing concerns over the scale of oil and gas industry lobbying as Scotland tries to move towards a zero-carbon economy, SALT said.Steve Goodrich, senior research managerwith Transparency International UK said: \"Far too much remains unknown about access and potential influence at Holyrood.\"Although the current law as drafted is a welcome step, there is still a long way to go. This provides a critical opportunity to bring greater transparency to lobbying in Scotland and bring it closer to better practice where, like in Ireland.ldquoThe current rules fall well short of international standards, and provide an obvious loophole for those seeking to avoid transparency. The definition of lobbying should include all forms of communication with decision makers, not just face-to-face meetings.\"SALT is also concerned over what they have described as the lsquoZoom lobbying loopholersquo.Under the current rules, video-calls from lobbyists would have to be declared as lobbying. Butthey turn the camera off, it suddenly becomes unreportable, and \"entirely hidden from voters view\".With such a signicant information gap, it becomes dficult to identythere has been any wrongdoing in controversial situations, SALT says.ldquoA major and concerning loophole in the current rules is that only face-to-face or video call meetings count as regulated lobbying. Counter to good practice standards, this means all other forms of written and oral communicationare withheld from public view.\"Bizarrely, as drafted, the law means that at the click of button in a Zoom call a meeting with a minister, MSP or senior civil servant can avoid regulation and the details withheld from public view. While democracy campaigners welcomed the introduction of the lobbying register, they are warning it does not go far enough in a digital age.SALT is calling for written and oral forms of communication to be covered by regulated lobbying and says that commercial lobbyists should disclose or estimate spending on campaigns.It maintains there should be an increase in the frequency of reporting to provide more timely information on lobbying activities. At present lobbying activities only have to be reported twice a year.Willie Sullivan, director of Electoral Reform Society Scotland, which is a leading member of the SALT coalition, said: ldquoThere are major gaps in the lobbying laws which are leaving voters in the dark. The Zoom lobbying loophole is so glaringly obvious that it should be closed as a matter of urgency. Ordinary voters ndash who donrsquot have millions to splash out on corporate campaigning - need to know who is targeting their representatives, and how much theyrsquore spending.ldquoScotland can lead the way in democratic transparency, but as things stands our rules are in some ways more lax than Westminsterrsquos, and need tightening to create a level playing field. We know first-hand that it would not be burdensome to regularly report how much resources are put into lobbying. Letrsquos close the loopholes and give voters the transparency they deserve.Only four of the  top lobbyists in the last register analysis could be said to represent the public interest. They were the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Scottish Trades Union Congressand charities for the blind and cancer research.Analysis also revealed that the four most lobbied ministers since March  were the former finance secretary, Derek Mackay the energy minister, Paul Wheelhouse the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon and the rural economy minister, Fergus Ewing.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid: ldquoThe operation and review of the statutory framework for lobbyingis amatter for the Scottish Parliament.ldquoIt is the responsibility of those who lobby to consider whether any engagement they have with lobbyees should be registered. If there is any uncertainty concerning the need to register, definitive guidance should be sought directly from the Scottish Parliament Lobbying Register Team."},{"url":null,"title":"40-scots-say-english-tourists-not-allowed-scotland---poll","story":"The poll ndash which asked , Scots their view on tourists entering from other countries without needing to quarantine ndash reported % of Scots quizzed support English tourists being able to enter the country without a period of isolation.The research also revealed signicant discrepancy along political lines when Scots were asked whether they support or oppose allowing tourists into the country.More than halfof SNP voters surveyed said they do not want English tourists to be able cross the border, compared to % of Scottish Labour voters and % of those who voted for the Scottish Conservatives at the  election.Just over a thirdof SNP voters support the current system of allowing English tourists in without requiring them to quarantine as opposed to % of Labour voters and % of Tory voters.Independence-supporting Yes voters from  oppose letting in English tourists by % to % whileNo voters support allowing English tourists into Scotland by % to %.:The border skirmish that signals a new battle of the UnionThe pollwas carried out a week after Scottish independence campaigners staged a protest at the border calling for people from England to be banned from entering or to impose a mandatory quarantine period.Scots are less likely to object to visitors from other parts of the UK, with % opposed to people coming from Wales and % of respondents wanting to block tourists from Northern Ireland.

By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Three Northern Ireland school principals on the controversy surrounding a covid-hit results day.Amanda McNamee, principal of Lagan College: #We#re dismayed to see our young people unsure of future pathways#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmanda McNamee FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAmanda McNameeThis year, our school community, like all others, has experienced unprecedented levels of change and disruption since March , but throughout the Covid- pandemic, we have been extremely proud of how our Sixth Form students have coped with the situation that the education system found itself in.Students had their learning disrupted, were denied the opportunity to sit examinations and experienced serious uncertainty about their future, but throughout it all they held an unwavering confidence that their teachers, who knew their learning best, would not let them down.As a centre of learning, Lagan College agrees that statistical modelling has its place in a normal given year.However, we believe more passionately that a teacher#s knowledge of their student#s learning, continuous assessment and potential supersedes this and this has been anything but a normal school year.So, our school community feels extremely disheartened and disappointed that some of our students believe that the education system has let them down.This year, we have recorded a signicant disparity between teacher centre assessed gradesand the final grades awarded by the Northern Ireland examination board.Some % of all A-level grades awarded were reduced, % of AS-level grades awarded were reduced.Unfortunately, until we receive more information and transparency about the awarding process used for an inidual learner, we do not feel confident that grades awarded to every student were a fair reflection of their work to date and potentialthey had been able to sit examinations.We were dismayed to see some of our students upset and disarmed yesterday and uncertain of their onward pathways. However, teachers were on hand to reassure our young people and their families that all of this was simply beyond their control.Let#s now all redouble our efforts in the education system to reflect upon yesterday#s events and ensure that the wellbeing of our young people is not unnecessarily and further impacted upon this year.Alan Hutchinson, principal of Glastry College, Newtownards: #Students# hopes dashed by farce and systemic discrimination#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlan Hutchinson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlan HutchinsonYesterday Glastry College students arrived to collect results full of hope for their future many excited about fulfilling their dreams by accessing higher education courses that will shape their lives and the lives of their families for decades to come. Instead, they were graced with what, at best, can be described as a farce and at worst systemic discrimination.At A-level % of our candidates were downgraded in at least one subject, while % of all Centre Assessed Grades were adjusted downwards.The statistical modelling used by CCEA appears to have taken no account of any work completed, or progress made by students in the seven months they studied during this academic year up until lockdown.Over the last five years our internal tracking data has indicated that we have predicted the overall A-level outcome for students to within -% either way.However, based upon the grades awarded by the examining body this year, our predictions appear to be out by an incredulous %!The question arises, do we trust and value the expert judgment of teaching professionals who have many years# experience, know the students as iniduals and have access to multiple sources of reliable assessment and tracking data, or data scientists who are more interested in decidedly limited and dubious data than the devastation caused to students, parents and teachers Statistics aside, we are dealing here with young people, with human beings, all of whom have hopes and aspirations, many of which are now dashed on a system they were promised would not disadvantage them.Moreover, the policy to go into lockdown appears to have dealt a signicant blow to those deemed to be least in need of the protection afforded by it.On top of this, we must acknowledge the trauma this cohort of pupils has already suffered.The opportunity to showcase their ability, skills, and knowledge acquired and developed over the last seven years was stolen.Their school career abruptly ended with no time for farewells or celebrations.Further anxiety was added by the enforced separation from their peers due to lockdown.Now, instead of aiding and supporting these pupils, CCEA has compounded this emotional distress, predominantly it seems, in non-selective schools by permitting what is nothing short of an incongruous travesty.I sincerely hope that immediate and rectying action is taken in the interests of all the young people unjustly penalised this year by a very flawed system.Gary Kelly, principal of St Kevin#s College, Lisnaskea: #My excitement turned to upset when I saw the pupils# grades#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGary Kelly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGary KellyWith over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, yesterday was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils# grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin#s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year#s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no - approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA exam board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly.It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out -ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school, and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year.But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils# grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board.Pupils are saying you know me Sir or Miss - I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results.They say: I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write - what does this say about me. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today - normally we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it#s more like  to .I don#t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both hear and across the whole of Northern Ireland.

Dreams have been shattered, places at top universities have been scrapped and young people have fallen victim to this complete farce of a model that Mr Weir and Mr Edwards have been dodging questions on since Thursday.I should not be a victim of historical data. I should not be downgraded because I chose integrated education rather than a grammar school.Our school prides itself on every pupil achieving their personal best.Does your model take this into consideration I deserve to be treated as an inidual. The modelling that has been used must be open to question and scrutiny, because it does not seem to reflect the actual student.It is more of an exercise in statistics far too much about the modelling is hidden and too many young people have been let down.Had a fire alarm gone off during our exams we#d all have been awarded our predicted grades.We#re going through a global pandemic, which is much more distressing, and thousands of young people have suffered because of this mess, fuelled by the decisions taken by Mr Edwards and Mr Weir.I have % trust in my teachers. Why don#t you Your model should be withdrawn, just like thousands of Ucas offers were withdrawn on Friday.Justin Edwards and Peter Weir, you have failed so many of us and robbed us of the grades we deserved.I hope you both take a long, hard look at yourselves and perhaps just stop to think about this absolute shambles you have created and all those dreams you have shattered in the process.Think about it aswe were your children and it was their futures at stake.Jamie Harkin is head boy at Drumragh Integrated School in Omagh  Belfast   Most ReadBallymena cafe workerdies after contracting Covid-Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Death of womanconfirmed as new Covid- cases surge by Rise in Covid cases in NI pushes R number to a dangerous .Bridge still on, says PM Boris Johnson as he derides border down Irish SeaDeveloper withdraws £m Belfast apart-hotel proposal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

teachers’ prediction.The SDLP is seeking the support of other MLAs to secure the  signatures required to force the recall of the Assembly from summer recess.The education committee did sit during recess to question Mr Weir on Friday.During the y hearing, chairman Chris Lyttle urged the minister to intervene and ensure pupils were awarded A-level grades based on either their AS-level attainment or the estimated grade assessed by their teacher.“These are unprecedented times,” said the Alliance MLA.Mr Lyttle said he was aware of a school that had seen its A*-C attainment rate fall from % last year to % under the calculation model.He said the minister was “increasingly isolated” in refusing to use the teacher assessments to allocate the grades.Mr Weir responded by insisting thatteacher predictions were used without standardisation, the results would not have “any level of credibility” because the results would be so much higher than those achieved in previous years.He said that approach would also be unfair on pupils, as some teachers would have been “generous” in estimating grades while others had been “tough” on their students.“There would be no equality whatsoever,” said

that the system for calculating A-level results “did not work for everyone”.He said there was no way of creating a perfect replacement for sitting the exams which were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.“We were looking to create what was a least-worst solution,” said the minister.Mr Weir highlighted that a fast-tracked appeals process has been established for those students who believe they have been treated unfairly.The standardisation model was developed by Northern Ireland exam body the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment .CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within their class.The exams body then used other data to standardise the results.For A-levels, the data included pupils’ AS-level results, making adjustments for those who had applied to take resits.For AS results, the pupils’ GCSE results were also used, as was the performance by their school over the previous three years.Today, SDLP have tabled a petition to recall the Assembly, to urgently address the crisis over exam grading. Many students across Northern Ireland feel robbed of a fair chance. It is not good enough.The Minister for Education and Joint First Ministers must be held to account. pic qsiKOSGK— Social Democratic and Labour PartyAugust , Daniel McCrossan, whose SDLP has urged the Assembly recall, branded the situation a “debacle”.He expressed concern about the mental health impact on children, revealing that a GP had contacted him to alert him that three pupils who had missed out on university places had presented with suicidal thoughts.“This model failed, it failed our children and it failed our young people,” he told the minister.He added: “As the result of this pandemic, they should not pay the price.”Mr McCrossan demanded more transparency on the algorithm used to calculate the grades.In regard to the algorithm, Mr McCrossan said there was a need to “mark the minister’s homework”.Mr Weir said he would make information on the formula public, though he stressed some of it would be technical data.He rejected calls for an independent review of CCEA’s actions.“I think CCEA processes were sound,” he said.“I don’t intend at this stage to have an independent review.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee Chief executive of CCEA Justin Edwards also faced questions at the committee.He defended the model used, insisting a range of academics and other experts were involved in its development.Mr Edwards stressed the limited time his organisation had to deliver on the minister’s key objectives – to produce a set of results for the  cohort and to ensure standards were in line with previous years.“People have worked inordinate hours in my organisation to deliver a solution,” he said.Mr Edwards added: “I’ve always cited that the best solution was examinations and it was not available to us.“And,it was not available to us, then this alternative approach was the next best operation.”He claimed no better solution had been presented.“If there was a viable alternative to this situation, then let it be brought forward,” he said.PAMost ReadBallymena cafe workerdies after contracting Covid-Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Death of womanconfirmed as new Covid- cases surge by Rise in Covid cases in NI pushes R number to a dangerous .Bridge still on, says PM Boris Johnson as he derides border down Irish SeaDeveloper withdraws £m Belfast apart-hotel proposal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is unacceptable, has reducedthe future options for many school leavers and caused immense distress. Teachers’ assessments should have been trusted much more than they have been. Education minister Peter Weir must intervene and do so urgently.”SDLP Education Spokesperson Daniel McCrossan MLA also expressed his concern and disappointmentat reports from young people that their grades were unfair and inaccurate. He has urged Minister Weir to ensure a robust appeals process is in place.The West Tyrone MLA added:“This is a highly stressful time for pupils across the North and their families. The failure of CCEA to remove the contentiousstandardisation from the grading process and the subsequent failure of the Education Minister to act has compounded that stress. It is not good enough.“The SDLP first raised these issues with CCEA and the Department of Education many months ago. They have been aware of these issues since April and utterly failed to act, at the expense of our young people.It is unacceptable and frankly disgraceful that our children have been left subject to a postcode lottery in relation to their exam results.This is about the future of our children and there can beno room for inequalityor unfairness.“The grading systemsusedmust not be allowed to disadvantagehigh-achieving pupils fromareas of deprivation.Standardisation cannot be allowed to become a euphemism for discrimination against working class children - even unintentionally.It is a crude and ineffective tool and has no place in a modern, fair education system.“It is clear the Minister should never have let this situation escalate and thestandardisationtool should have been put in the bin many months ago. However, Minister Weir must now act urgently to ensure the appeals process is robust and allows young people the opportunity to challenge grades they are deeply disappointed with.“The Minister must also compel CCEA to publish themodelling and calculation process used to determine grades this year, to allow young people all the information they need to seetheir grade is fair, accurate and reflective of their ability.“I want toapologiseto school children right across the North, particularly those getting A-Level grades today and GCSE grades next week. You have been put in an intolerably dficult position and I am sorry thatthis failure was allowed to happen.This is not your fault and we have got your back.“The SDLP will continue to fight for grades to be restored, based onteachersjudgement, and without the crude bias of thestandardisationstool.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl.

She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place. Then with less than m nearly vertical metres to go, he surged past Cachard to move into thirrd place and crossed the line in  minutes and  seconds. The winner, Aymonod, was home in : with Magnini second in :. Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

We will work with a broad spectrum of people and voices, including those from the political parties, business, tourism and the voluntary and community sectors to deliver an ambitious and exciting programme of events. The Historical Advisory Panel will provide expert insight on the historical facts and themes of this period, encouraging wider engagement with, and reflection on, our shared history.Despite the many challenges it faced over the course of the twentieth century and a long and dficult journey to the peace and prosperity it enjoys today, Northern Ireland has a wonderful, rich and vibrant cultural and industrial heritage.Since my appointment over a year ago, I can personally attest to the warm welcome and hospitality which is offered all across Northern Ireland, no matter who you are or where you come from.We believe the centenary of Northern Ireland represents a huge opportunity for us to look towards a shared and more prosperous future for all of us, as one United Kingdom.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsPlan for  homes in Portadown gets green lightA controversial plan for a further  houses to be built near Lisnisky Lane, was approved at August’s meeting of Armagh, City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s planning and regulatory services committee.By The NewsroomThursday, th August , : am\"\"The outline application lodged by agent Alan Patterson Design Ltd, on behalf of applicant Sustar Ltd will see approximately  dwellings and a crèche built on lands to the east of Bracken Lodge Lisnisky Road and Lisnisky Lane.The development of this . acres site will be delivered in phases, each of which will require further planning approval.There are also conditions attached to phases withplanning officers wanting to ensure plans for the proposed crèche are submitted and approved by the Council by the time the th dwelling is approved.The crèche must also be completed and operated prior to the occupation of the th house.This is to ensure that the community facility approved within the application is provided.One of the conditions attached to this approval will ensure a two lane approach to roundabout  is submitted to and approved in writing by the Council and this work shall be completed prior to the occupation of  households.The outline proposal also includes a new access point to these lands to be created approximately m south of No  Lisnisky Lane.The application has receiveda total of  letters of objection from four separatepostal addresses and one letter of support.Speaking against the proposal on Wednesday afternoon, Councillor Margaret Tinsley said she was not against the application for new housing but was very concerned about “traffic congestion in the area at peak times”.“Prior to COVID, traffic was queuedback from roundabout  to roundabout  already so how will these roads cope with potentially another , cars,” said the DUP representative.“Any improvement the Department for Infrastructureare to make to the roads need to be in place now, not when the houses are built.“I am not against these new homes totally I just want to ensure these traffic problems do not escalate further.”Speaking on behalf of the application, SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson reminded the committee the lands are already zoned for housing.“These proposals are for very high quality development, there will becrèche facilities on site and homeowners will be able to walk to local places of employment.“This fits in with the singular concept of Craigavon and will be a great boost to the local economy with development costs of over £ million.“I understand the concerns around traffic but I trust the DfI engineers have done their job and I commend the developer and the team working on this proposal as they have clearly worked hard to come up with this excellent proposal.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson identied traffic congestion as the biggest bugbear with regards to this application and asked road service how they had got to the point where they are happy with the application.A member of Road Serviceinformed the committee that a transport assessment had been submitted as part of the application and was found to be acceptable.“A range of road improvements are being delivered with this application in a phased manner, including a link road to Old Lurgan Road and a two lane approach to roundabout ,” said the DfI representative.It was also revealed that traffic management modelling showed Craigavon’s roundabout’s worked in isolation but when joined together, the problems stemmed from the hospital roundabout junction.“This was passed on to my colleagues in development control and it was their decision to accept what was presented,” said another DfI representative.Following questioning about the condition of Lisnisky Lane from Councillor Peter Lavery, Council’s case officer in charge of the report advised this application was an outline application.“In future applications access will have to be considered and no development shall commence until work has been carried out at roundabout ,” said the case officer.“Proposals for a new access to the hospital have been submitted this week but that has to go through due process we can’t take for granted that will be approved when considering this application.”Alderman Sydney Anderson said he saw this development as an opportunity.“As the development is being built I would like to think Road Service would take on board the need to develop the road network as well,” said the DUP representative.Sinn Fein Councillor Paul Duffy describedthe area as “growing” while his party colleague Councillor Garath Keating said it was clear that traffic was a problem in the area but didn’t feel this was the developer’s fault.“I don’t think we can lay the blame for traffic problems on a new development,” said Cllr Keating.“If you are going to use traffic problems as a reason to refuse this application it would be very prejudicial on availabilityof new housing.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was in agreement with this assessment but was mindful of the need to continue to monitor road use as the dferent phases of this application were submitted.Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson said there was work to be done with this application.“The traffic problem is not a unique problem and I don’t think we can blame the developer for that, the onus is on the Department to future proof the road network,” said Councillor Nicholson.SDLP Councillor Mealla Campbell said she had been reassured by all she had heard and proposed accepting the outline application.This proposal was seconded by Councillor Paul Duffy and committee members voiced their agreement.Speaking on behalf of Sustar, development consultant Michael Hannath welcomed the positive decision for this application which he said will be very signicant for the local area. He said: “Demand for new homes in this location remains very healthy and our agents have already received direct expressions of interest from over  parties for future housing in the next phases since the first phase at Bracken Hall was completed.”Michael went on to point out that the application has already gone through a rigorous planning process and has been subject to a wider environmental impact assessment and subsequent comprehensive environmental statement. As part of that process, he said, there have been detailed traffic assessments carried out and important input from a multi-disciplinary team of competent experts led by planning consultants Oriel Planning. Detailed surveys and reports have been carried out in Traffic and Transport, Ecology, Hydrogeology, Geology and Soils, Drainage and Flood Risk, Noise and Vibration, Air Quality and Contaminated Land and Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment. In addition, community consultation events have taken place at which feedback has been received and taken on board. He said: “Some local residents have objected to the proposal because of concerns that they believe increased housing will add to an already congested stretch of road between the Lisnisky Lane roundabout and the hospital roundabout and heading into town. The main concerns appear to be around traffic congestion at peak am times particularly where we have the merging of traffic from the two-lane carriageway into a single lane coming from Craigavon direction and heading towards the hospital.”Michael pointed out: “Numerous consultations with Dfi roads over the past three years have informed the proposals and detailed design considerations have been integrated in order to address these concerns. The development team are confident that the development meets the design requirements and policy set out by Dfi Roads and this has been confirmed by Dfi roads in their final consultation responses. “The current proposal includes the widening of Lisnisky Lane at the approach to roundabout . There will be a flare lane added at the bottom of Lisnisky Lane for traffic turning left towards town which should reduce the traffic backing up in this area and permit traffic flow coming down Lisnisky Lane to go around the roundabout and head out of town.“In addition, the approval has a condition which requires the delivery of a second access to the lands before the occupation of the th house.“Sustar have been working with Dfi Roads and the Trust to assist with the delivery of a suitable option and a design for a new roundabout on Lisnisky Lane at the back entrance to hospital has now been finalised.“The developer has been working with Dfi roads and the Trust to facilitate the delivery of this for some time now and we understand a planning application is expected to be lodged imminently by the Trust. The proposed roundabout approved will provide a new well needed second access to the Hospital, a realignment of Lisnisky Lane heading to the old Lurgan Road and a connection into the development lands. This roundabout would greatly relieve the peak hour traffic congestion.”Michael was keen to point out that the positive economic impact of this development is “very signicant for the local economy. It will generate employment and jobs across a iety of disciplines, construction jobs, both skilled and unskilled as well as jobs in the materials supply and marketing sectors”. In total the development costs of this housing scheme are estimated to be in excess of £ million at present day costs “with a consequential inflow of benefits both financial and social into the local and wider economies”. He said the developers will now work with the council’s planning team and Dfi roads to bring forward detailed proposals for the final design stage of the development which is proposed to take place over phases and has an expected timeframe of - years.“This proposal will bring very signicant investment to our local economy at a time when it could do with an injection of positive new,” Michael concluded.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"vj day event welcomed dup and sf ","story":"Bridal suite opened by NI charity with new and pre-loved gownsTraffic disruption expected as two £k NI road schemes to startNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsVJ Day event welcomed by DUP and SFArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s event to celebrate the th anniversary of VJ Day has been welcomed by both the DUP and Sinn Fein.By The NewsroomThursday, th August , : pm\"\"Council has confirmed a shared history event to mark the occasion will take place this Saturday, August .Many local people were heldas Japanese prisoners of war and the stories of their experience still haunt the families to this day.The event will include a lecture from renowned historian Dr Eamon Phoenix, poetry reading by local historian Richard Edgar and a musical accompaniment from piper Ian Burrows.Speaking about the event, Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage said: “Shared history events are important for a ided society.“We hope that by embracing social media and digital technology we can attract wider audiences comprised of people who – for ious reasons – might not normally attend such an event in person.“With COVID- still very much a concern at the moment, we are hoping to run more online events like these to ensure we’re minimising the risk to our residents while still offering the excellent events we’re known for, albeit in a slightly dferent way.”DUP group whip Councillor Darryn Causby said it was important for Council to mark the occasion, widely regarded as the end of the second World War.“It is important for Council to mark this occasion,” he said.“We are obviously disappointed that it could not be marked in a more substantial way than what we are doing.“However, we welcome the fact all parties recognise the vital role the British Army played during the second World War and we welcome that across the piece.”Speaking about ABC Council’s shared history event SinnFein group leader, Councillor Liam Mackle said: “Many local people lost their lives in this conflict.“The Lord Mayor will pay special tribute to local man Jim Haughey.
