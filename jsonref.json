I think she is doing the best she can in the public eye\u0027 she told the Sunday Mirror.\u0027I\u0027ve always really looked up to her, like a big sister I never had. She took me shopping for kids books and clothes.\u0027She taught me how important it was to read books. She\u0027s kind, genuine, very thoughtful and warm\u0027 she added.Ms Rasmussen also said she was \u0027embarrassed\u0027 by the way her mother and other relatives had treated Meghan since the news of the engagement broke.   Samantha Grant, who shares a father with half-sister Meghan, said the former Suits actress should have invited several family members \u0027out of respect\u0027.\u0027At issue is not a matter of closeness as more than 1,000 complete strangers are invited,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027Family is family. I have an uncle I have only seen once by I would never say he is not family because we are not close. Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to family.\u0027  Ms Grant, who uses a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, later changed her profile picture to a snap of her and Meghan together when they were younger.          Meghan Markle has angered family members by not inviting them to the weddingHowever, according to a Palace source, the list of 600 guests does include several star names, including the celebrity vet who treated Meghan\u0027s dog. And all of Harry\u0027s aunts and uncles – Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne – will be there.Last night Michael, 78, who had a distinguished 19-year US government career, told The Mail on Sunday how he helped Meghan get a job at the American embassy in Argentina in 2001 when she was just 20 – a position she later boasted about in interviews.\u0027I knew the ambassador and I asked him if he could help, as her application was a little on the late side,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s why I don\u0027t understand why she has been so indifferent towards me. It\u0027s uncalled for. I helped her out and I didn\u0027t ask for anything in return.\u0027I\u0027m upset and surprised about not being selected but if they don\u0027t want me there, then I don\u0027t want to go.\u0027This whole invitation thing has not been played out very well. I never did anything to embarrass Meghan. It seems to me they handled the arrangements poorly.\u0027It was not well thought-out because no Markles I know are going to the wedding, although you\u0027d expect the bride\u0027s father to be there. I\u0027m disappointed, but I hope she has a good wedding.\u0027Michael\u0027s daughter Trish Gallop, 58, added: \u0027People usually invite their families to weddings, whether they are close or not. I would have loved to have given her my best wishes. We as a family are very saddened that we won\u0027t be there to witness her beautiful celebration.\u0027The comments came amid growing disquiet about the wedding plans and who is \u0027in\u0027 and \u0027out\u0027.Palestinian rocket scientist is assassinated by \u0027Mossad\u0027...\u0027She was beautiful till the day she died\u0027: Jeb Bush\u0027s...Share this articleAmong those The Mail on Sunday understands are attending are TV \u0027supervet\u0027 Noel Fitzpatrick, former England football captain David Beckham and his wife Victoria, and tennis legend Serena Williams.Victoria Beckham declined to confirm if she and her husband were going, while Prof Fitzpatrick, who treated Meghan\u0027s beloved beagle Guy when he broke his legs, said: \u0027No comment.\u0027 However, Palace insiders say he is on the list.The main cast members of Suits, the legal drama that propelled Meghan to fame, have been invited, a source close to the show said, adding: \u0027They are thrilled.

I want to give and receive true, heartfelt passion. But when I first fell in love, aged 18, I was struggling with a difficult home life: my mum, Sheree, was in a low phase and the fear that she would take her own life always haunted me.This was the early Seventies, and I\u0027d just started working as a pub DJ. People were into drinking and having fun, and when one thing led to another that frequently meant sex.I was doing what came naturally, shall we say, and discovered that I\u0027d fallen in love with two people at the same time — one called Caroline, and one named John.My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. But she was struggling with depression and I was walking on eggshells, trying to balance her ill health with my working life.Dale Winton ‘died of a broken heart after being dumped by US...The Bond Girl mum who gave me my love of the limelight: DALE...Share this articleReally, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsession. Boys at my school would be into the Stones or the Monkees, but all I cared about was Dusty.Put it this way, my favourite of all my mother\u0027s boyfriends, after she orced my dad, was a man called Aubrey who listened to Dusty singing Son Of A Preacher Man with me, and pronounced it \u0027a very strong song\u0027. That won my approval!The extraordinary thing is that, though I have met so many stars in my career, I only ever spoke once to Dusty. And that was by phone when I was a presenter at Radio Trent in Nottingham. I did see her once at a book signing, but I was too shy to go and say hello.Shortly after she died in 1999, I went to an exhibition of her memorabilia and a woman approached me to introduce herself as \u0027Barbara — Dusty\u0027s secretary\u0027. She told me a story that broke my heart.          My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. Really, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsessionA couple of years earlier, when Dusty was being driven around Soho by her chauffeur, she spotted me on the pavement and cried out: \u0027Oh look — there\u0027s Dale!\u0027At first, I was astonished at the very idea, then I realised I had mentioned her in just about every interview I had ever done. She probably knew what a huge fan I was.And here\u0027s the saddest part: her driver suggested stopping so she could get out to meet me and she said: \u0027No, I\u0027m too shy.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that awful? I was suddenly overcome with emotion at the thought, and collapsed on a chair, knocked off my feet by an incredible wave of grief.I was luckier with another musical heroine, the wonderful Cilla Black. We\u0027d been friends for years and she was a great fan of Supermarket Sweep — so much so that she invited me to come to push a shopping trolley on a Christmas edition of her top-rated show, Surprise Surprise.I wanted to repay the compliment, and when I was asked to stand in for Lorraine Kelly for a week on GMTV, Cilla was top of my guest wishlist. She couldn\u0027t make it because she and her husband Bobby were at their villa in Marbella. But when I told them I was due in Marbella for a TV shoot, they insisted I visit them.Sitting on their patio, chatting to Bobby while Cilla rustled up the most fantastic lunch, I couldn\u0027t have felt more at home. From that moment, we all became firm friends.After Bobby died in 1999, it would have been easy for her to fall to pieces but, heartbroken though she was, she said: \u0027I may have lost the love of my life, but I haven\u0027t lost my love of life.\u0027 That\u0027s so Cilla.Another of the grandes dames of showbusiness whose company I adore is Barbara Windsor. At her 60th birthday party I had a great time meeting almost the entire cast of EastEnders, before finding myself the centre of attention with some quite different East End characters.          Dale Winton is pictured leaving Scotts restaurant in London on July 26, 2016Tony Lambrianou, an infamous Sixties gangster who had served time for his part in a notorious murder, grabbed me and said in the gruffest of voices: \u0027Hello Dale, I\u0027m taking you to meet the guv\u0027nor.\u0027This was Freddie Foreman, a former associate of the Kray twins and the self-proclaimed \u0027godfather of British crime\u0027. \u0027Don\u0027t forget, Dale,\u0027 Mr Lambrianou growled, \u0027he\u0027s the guv\u0027nor. Show respect!\u0027I wasn\u0027t at all sure what to expect — but I have to speak as I find, and say the two of them could not have been more charming to me. Dusty, Cilla, Bar . . . I suppose I\u0027ve always been drawn to strong women, and that\u0027s my mother\u0027s legacy.My father was much less influential in my life, though I can\u0027t deny his death had an effect.He had always made it clear he felt little responsibility for me. When I was ten and my parents were orcing, he told me: \u0027Your mother will always look after you, Dale, so I\u0027m going to spend all my own money. I\u0027m leaving you nothing.\u0027He was true to his spiteful word — his will amounted to £284.Aged 13 and coming up to my bar mitzvah, the Jewish ceremony that marks a boy\u0027s transition to manhood, I was taken to Westminster Hospital to visit him.Though my mother had warned me he was not expected to live more than another day or two, she tried to keep his spirits up.\u0027You\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 she said to him, \u0027you\u0027re going to get better. You can come and recuperate at the house. We\u0027ll nurse you back to health.\u0027By now, Mum was living with another man (Aubrey, who shared my admiration for Dusty), but her kind words perked up Dad\u0027s morale. He began to make a miraculous recovery.          This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened outMum was in a state of panic. \u0027My God, what are we going to do?\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027I\u0027ve given him a reason to live and he\u0027s getting better by the minute. I\u0027ve made a promise to this man and he could be living with us within a week.\u0027More than that, he was planning to come to my bar mitzvah.I hadn\u0027t attended synagogue on a regular basis, and I was learning the Hebrew words of the ceremony phonetically, memorising the sounds without understanding their precise meaning. Dad would expect me to be word perfect. The big day was two weeks away, and it was all turning into a black farce.Then Dad had a relapse. Plans changed: he wasn\u0027t coming to the synagogue at all. Instead, I would do my bar mitzvah before the rabbi, with all my relatives watching, then take my tallis, capel and book to the hospital and read it to Dad.As I performed the ritual, speaking everything I had been taught, the congregation was in tears.It wasn\u0027t until afterwards that Mum took me to one side, kissed me, congratulated me and then put an arm around my shoulders. \u0027Dale,\u0027 she said, \u0027your father died this morning.\u0027She had to speak to the rabbi about Dad\u0027s funeral, and to deal with all the relatives. Aubrey the boyfriend took me to sit in his car.I asked him for a cigarette, and though I was only 13, he understood that I\u0027d been through enough. He let me sit in the passenger seat, blowing the smoke out of the window.I don\u0027t know what became of Aubrey. After a while, he just wasn\u0027t around any more. Maybe if he had still been there when I reached 18, I could have talked to Mum more easily about my love life. Because she really didn\u0027t want to know.I remember inviting her to look at a second-hand car at a garage on the Edgware Road. This was about 1972, the era of flared trousers and corduroy caps, and guys didn\u0027t have to be gay to carry a shoulder-bag.          I preferred to be ambiguous about my sexuality, but I\u0027m wise enough to realise that if you appear on the telly, there are certain things people think they have the right to knowFeeling very much the dedicated follower of fashion, I flounced into the garage with a bag swinging against my hip.I must have looked like a pastiche of Seventies camp, and Mum burst out laughing. \u0027Dale, if you could just see yourself,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re such a character. I wouldn\u0027t have you any other way.\u0027That wasn\u0027t really true. Soon after, I fell in love with John who was unmistakeably gay, and in the way of Seventies teens we used to natter for hours on the phone.One day, while we were chatting, Mum burst out of her bedroom in a rage. \u0027Are you talking to John again? You know he\u0027s gay, don\u0027t you? And if that doesn\u0027t bother you and you\u0027re hanging around with him, that probably means . . . you\u0027re going to be gay yourself!\u0027This tirade came out of the blue, and it got worse. \u0027I\u0027ve worked with gay people in the theatre and the movies,\u0027 Mum told me. \u0027They\u0027re great fun, but being gay makes for a very lonely old age.\u0027You don\u0027t have to be gay, Dale. There is an alternative. We can get help. This doesn\u0027t have to be the way for you.\u0027Shocked, I walked out . . . though I came back a week later.I\u0027ve never blamed Mum. It was the way most parents thought then. She wanted what she thought was best for me: marriage, a family — and grandchildren for herself.This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened out. Perhaps that\u0027s part of the reason why, when journalists asked if I was \u0027one of those\u0027, I preferred to say nothing.I never forgot that afternoon. I was stunned and filled with guilt at having caused Mum such terrible distress when she was already depressed. I loved my mother with all my heart and I didn\u0027t want to disappoint or offend her. But I knew I could never be the person she wanted me to be.Until the day she died, I was never able to tell her: \u0027Mum, I\u0027m gay — and I honestly think that\u0027s OK.\u0027Adapted from My Story by Dale Winton (Arrow Books, £9.99).

Scorching sun gives way to rain this week...Corbyn calls for St George\u0027s Day OFF! Labour leader will...Share this articleIt is claimed the Guernsey system could cut the amount of household waste sent for landfill or incineration by 20per cent.The Guernsey system will involve families buying stickers that are put on to black bags to certify they should be cleared by the binmen - much like putting a stamp on a letter.          The Taxpayers Alliance have argued that the scheme will encourage fly-tippersThe fee will be £2.50 per black bag of rubbish plus an annual fixed charge of £85 per household.Introducing ‘pay as you throw’ (PAYT) has been attacked by the Taxpayers’ Alliance and Big Brother Watch. They argue it would increase fly tipping, as people try to avoid charges, and allow local councils to spy on families’ bin habits.A new survey found that three in four people are ‘concerned’ or ‘very concerned’ that adopting a PAYT system would lead to a rise in fly-tipping and so-called bin dumping, with people trying to save money by putting their rubbish in someone else’s bin.People were also worried about the charges and six in ten of those against PAYT were concerned it would not be affordable for people on low incomes.The survey of 1,000 UK householders was undertaken for waste management and environmental communications consultancy Pelican Communications.          The scheme which will begin in Guernsey is seen as setting a template which could be adopted by BritainIt found that, despite the potential problems, one in three UK households were open to the idea of PAYT - rising to two in three when the details about how it would improve recycling were explained.Pelican’s managing director, Michael Bennett, said: ‘Unsurprisingly 86per cent of respondents hadn’t heard of PAYT, but once the system was explained to them 34per cent indicated they were in favour, with a further 37per cent saying that they might be in favour.’ When asked to consider which potential benefits of PAYT appealed to them, 79per cent said that the possibility it would encourage more recycling was the key factor, as well as being seen by 60per cent as a significant incentive to reduce waste production.Some 40per cent said that it would be fairer on small households, which produce less rubbish than families, particularly those with young children.Sixty per cent said they would be more supportive of PAYT if it was guaranteed to tackle increasing waste production and product consumption. This went up to 65per cent being more supportive if PAYT schemes were guaranteed to increase recycling and have a beneficial environmental impact.Mr Bennett said: ‘This research highlights the importance of winning the hearts and minds of residents for councils considering introducing PAYT.‘Councils need to ensure they make a convincing environmental case for the system, that they are able to demonstrate that such schemes deliver positive environmental results, and that they can be managed fairly and effectively.‘In addition, they need to be very sensitive to the concerns of the third of respondents who are worried about increased costs and the adverse effects on lower income households and ensure the system is equitable.’ He added: ‘PAYT has the potential to give household recycling in many local authority areas a much-needed shot in the arm.‘However, there are significant educational, legal and political challenges that will have to be overcome and only a very committed council would embark on its introduction at this time, without funding and political leadership from a city region, devolved administration or national government.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/08/4B724F3300000578-5645647-image-m-3_1524467761074.jpg","title":"S Korea halts border broadcasts ahead Kim summit","story":"      South Korea\u0027s military has turned off giant speaker arrays that it uses to broadcast propaganda into North Korea ahead of a summit between the countries\u0027 leaders          South Korea said turning off the speakers was designed to create \u0027an atmosphere of peace\u0027 ahead of a summit between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un on FridayThe speakers usually broadcast a mixture of K-Pop music, news reports critical of the North and messages urging soldiers to defect to the South.The messages can be heard by soldiers stationed along the border, and nearby villagers. North Korea has speaker arrays of its own which is uses to broadcast messages critical of the South.

I want to give and receive true, heartfelt passion. But when I first fell in love, aged 18, I was struggling with a difficult home life: my mum, Sheree, was in a low phase and the fear that she would take her own life always haunted me.This was the early Seventies, and I\u0027d just started working as a pub DJ. People were into drinking and having fun, and when one thing led to another that frequently meant sex.I was doing what came naturally, shall we say, and discovered that I\u0027d fallen in love with two people at the same time — one called Caroline, and one named John.My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. But she was struggling with depression and I was walking on eggshells, trying to balance her ill health with my working life.Dale Winton ‘died of a broken heart after being dumped by US...The Bond Girl mum who gave me my love of the limelight: DALE...Share this articleReally, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsession. Boys at my school would be into the Stones or the Monkees, but all I cared about was Dusty.Put it this way, my favourite of all my mother\u0027s boyfriends, after she orced my dad, was a man called Aubrey who listened to Dusty singing Son Of A Preacher Man with me, and pronounced it \u0027a very strong song\u0027. That won my approval!The extraordinary thing is that, though I have met so many stars in my career, I only ever spoke once to Dusty. And that was by phone when I was a presenter at Radio Trent in Nottingham. I did see her once at a book signing, but I was too shy to go and say hello.Shortly after she died in 1999, I went to an exhibition of her memorabilia and a woman approached me to introduce herself as \u0027Barbara — Dusty\u0027s secretary\u0027. She told me a story that broke my heart.          My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. Really, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsessionA couple of years earlier, when Dusty was being driven around Soho by her chauffeur, she spotted me on the pavement and cried out: \u0027Oh look — there\u0027s Dale!\u0027At first, I was astonished at the very idea, then I realised I had mentioned her in just about every interview I had ever done. She probably knew what a huge fan I was.And here\u0027s the saddest part: her driver suggested stopping so she could get out to meet me and she said: \u0027No, I\u0027m too shy.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that awful? I was suddenly overcome with emotion at the thought, and collapsed on a chair, knocked off my feet by an incredible wave of grief.I was luckier with another musical heroine, the wonderful Cilla Black. We\u0027d been friends for years and she was a great fan of Supermarket Sweep — so much so that she invited me to come to push a shopping trolley on a Christmas edition of her top-rated show, Surprise Surprise.I wanted to repay the compliment, and when I was asked to stand in for Lorraine Kelly for a week on GMTV, Cilla was top of my guest wishlist. She couldn\u0027t make it because she and her husband Bobby were at their villa in Marbella. But when I told them I was due in Marbella for a TV shoot, they insisted I visit them.Sitting on their patio, chatting to Bobby while Cilla rustled up the most fantastic lunch, I couldn\u0027t have felt more at home. From that moment, we all became firm friends.After Bobby died in 1999, it would have been easy for her to fall to pieces but, heartbroken though she was, she said: \u0027I may have lost the love of my life, but I haven\u0027t lost my love of life.\u0027 That\u0027s so Cilla.Another of the grandes dames of showbusiness whose company I adore is Barbara Windsor. At her 60th birthday party I had a great time meeting almost the entire cast of EastEnders, before finding myself the centre of attention with some quite different East End characters.          Dale Winton is pictured leaving Scotts restaurant in London on July 26, 2016Tony Lambrianou, an infamous Sixties gangster who had served time for his part in a notorious murder, grabbed me and said in the gruffest of voices: \u0027Hello Dale, I\u0027m taking you to meet the guv\u0027nor.\u0027This was Freddie Foreman, a former associate of the Kray twins and the self-proclaimed \u0027godfather of British crime\u0027. \u0027Don\u0027t forget, Dale,\u0027 Mr Lambrianou growled, \u0027he\u0027s the guv\u0027nor. Show respect!\u0027I wasn\u0027t at all sure what to expect — but I have to speak as I find, and say the two of them could not have been more charming to me. Dusty, Cilla, Bar . . . I suppose I\u0027ve always been drawn to strong women, and that\u0027s my mother\u0027s legacy.My father was much less influential in my life, though I can\u0027t deny his death had an effect.He had always made it clear he felt little responsibility for me. When I was ten and my parents were orcing, he told me: \u0027Your mother will always look after you, Dale, so I\u0027m going to spend all my own money. I\u0027m leaving you nothing.\u0027He was true to his spiteful word — his will amounted to £284.Aged 13 and coming up to my bar mitzvah, the Jewish ceremony that marks a boy\u0027s transition to manhood, I was taken to Westminster Hospital to visit him.Though my mother had warned me he was not expected to live more than another day or two, she tried to keep his spirits up.\u0027You\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 she said to him, \u0027you\u0027re going to get better. You can come and recuperate at the house. We\u0027ll nurse you back to health.\u0027By now, Mum was living with another man (Aubrey, who shared my admiration for Dusty), but her kind words perked up Dad\u0027s morale. He began to make a miraculous recovery.          This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened outMum was in a state of panic. \u0027My God, what are we going to do?\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027I\u0027ve given him a reason to live and he\u0027s getting better by the minute. I\u0027ve made a promise to this man and he could be living with us within a week.\u0027More than that, he was planning to come to my bar mitzvah.I hadn\u0027t attended synagogue on a regular basis, and I was learning the Hebrew words of the ceremony phonetically, memorising the sounds without understanding their precise meaning. Dad would expect me to be word perfect. The big day was two weeks away, and it was all turning into a black farce.Then Dad had a relapse. Plans changed: he wasn\u0027t coming to the synagogue at all. Instead, I would do my bar mitzvah before the rabbi, with all my relatives watching, then take my tallis, capel and book to the hospital and read it to Dad.As I performed the ritual, speaking everything I had been taught, the congregation was in tears.It wasn\u0027t until afterwards that Mum took me to one side, kissed me, congratulated me and then put an arm around my shoulders. \u0027Dale,\u0027 she said, \u0027your father died this morning.\u0027She had to speak to the rabbi about Dad\u0027s funeral, and to deal with all the relatives. Aubrey the boyfriend took me to sit in his car.I asked him for a cigarette, and though I was only 13, he understood that I\u0027d been through enough. He let me sit in the passenger seat, blowing the smoke out of the window.I don\u0027t know what became of Aubrey. After a while, he just wasn\u0027t around any more. Maybe if he had still been there when I reached 18, I could have talked to Mum more easily about my love life. Because she really didn\u0027t want to know.I remember inviting her to look at a second-hand car at a garage on the Edgware Road. This was about 1972, the era of flared trousers and corduroy caps, and guys didn\u0027t have to be gay to carry a shoulder-bag.          I preferred to be ambiguous about my sexuality, but I\u0027m wise enough to realise that if you appear on the telly, there are certain things people think they have the right to knowFeeling very much the dedicated follower of fashion, I flounced into the garage with a bag swinging against my hip.I must have looked like a pastiche of Seventies camp, and Mum burst out laughing. \u0027Dale, if you could just see yourself,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re such a character. I wouldn\u0027t have you any other way.\u0027That wasn\u0027t really true. Soon after, I fell in love with John who was unmistakeably gay, and in the way of Seventies teens we used to natter for hours on the phone.One day, while we were chatting, Mum burst out of her bedroom in a rage. \u0027Are you talking to John again? You know he\u0027s gay, don\u0027t you? And if that doesn\u0027t bother you and you\u0027re hanging around with him, that probably means . . . you\u0027re going to be gay yourself!\u0027This tirade came out of the blue, and it got worse. \u0027I\u0027ve worked with gay people in the theatre and the movies,\u0027 Mum told me. \u0027They\u0027re great fun, but being gay makes for a very lonely old age.\u0027You don\u0027t have to be gay, Dale. There is an alternative. We can get help. This doesn\u0027t have to be the way for you.\u0027Shocked, I walked out . . . though I came back a week later.I\u0027ve never blamed Mum. It was the way most parents thought then. She wanted what she thought was best for me: marriage, a family — and grandchildren for herself.This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened out. Perhaps that\u0027s part of the reason why, when journalists asked if I was \u0027one of those\u0027, I preferred to say nothing.I never forgot that afternoon. I was stunned and filled with guilt at having caused Mum such terrible distress when she was already depressed. I loved my mother with all my heart and I didn\u0027t want to disappoint or offend her. But I knew I could never be the person she wanted me to be.Until the day she died, I was never able to tell her: \u0027Mum, I\u0027m gay — and I honestly think that\u0027s OK.\u0027Adapted from My Story by Dale Winton (Arrow Books, £9.99).

Supreme is the first UK vaping company to go public.Supreme owns the KiK and 88vape brands and makes more than 130,000 bottles of vaping e-liquids a day. It also sells hardware kits and vaping accessories, along with lightbulbs and 200m batteries in the past year.The firm supplies retailers such as Asda, Halfords, B\u0026ampM, Poundland, Iceland, Home Bargains and wholesalers including Booker, Bestway, Costcutter and Nisa.Supreme made revenues of £70.7m in the past year and earnings before interest and tax of £7.2m in the year to the end of March.Chadha, who paid himself a idend of £4.5m last year, is expected to retain a majority stake after the firm goes public.The business was set up by his father in 1975 after the family moved to Britain from Delhi when he was two years old.

For some it’s A Tale of Two Cities, for others it’s Catch-22, and for a minority it’s that Frankie Goes to Hollywood video where Ronald Reagan is wrestling the leader of the Soviet Union. Up until this year, I probably would have said the last one (it’s the way Reagan gets Konstantin Chernenko into a chokeslam that does it for me). But recently I’ve discovered a new show that has made me reconsider my perception of the hyper-combative world that we live in. It’s not a satire, or a documentary. It’s the brilliant competitive baking show Nailed It!, and it is both the funniest thing on television and the most devastating, absurdist criticism of capitalism in modern times.I’m aware I sound like I’m a few fangs short of a shark cake here. From the outside, Nailed It! is just another in a long line of upsettingly stressful cooking shows, where members of the public have a nervous breakdown on TV because they used slightly too many eggs in a crème pâtissière. Even before the Great British Bake Off was added to Netflix, there was a surfeit of these shows on the service. In all of them – and, in fact, in any competitive reality show, whether the competitive element is sewing, being a drag queen, building a toilet or manually stimulating a pig – the key ingredient is tension. The stakes have to be real, and they have to be high: without tension, the GBBO is just a set of people putting stuff in ovens, and one time putting stuff in a bin.In some ways, competitive reality TV is a microcosm for the competitive nature of society: every contestant is pitted against each other, fighting to be recognised as the best bakerbutchercandlestick maker (Love Productions is probably already filming the Great British Candlestick Carving, hosted by Jo Whiley), and the panic and stress they go through is what makes it compelling viewing – that and the slight chance that at some point Gordon Ramsay will scream so hard, he’ll turn inside out.And yet Nailed It! breaks all the rules of competitive reality TV. Each episode, three wonderfully incompetent bakers – the kind who would put laundry detergent in a cake instead of baking soda – are made to take on distressingly complicated cakes (like a three-tiered wedding cake, or a princess tower complete with princess and dragon), with very few instructions and an unrealistically short amount of time. Unlike all other competitive reality shows, where failure is not an option, here it is the only option – the wedding cake will obviously collapse, the princess in the tower will look like a melting goblin, the bust of Donald Trump will look like Gollum with a coke habit.But unlike all other competitive reality shows, no one cares – there’s no Paul Hollywood savaging of soggy bottoms, no Gordon Ramsay hellshriek at a slightly overdone pastry. There’s just Nicole Byer (arguably the funniest host on TV right now, and definitely the best at saying “Oh God, do not eat that!” with her eyes) and the expert judges, who are forced to sit there, not saying anything as these amateur bakers mangle their recipes into doughy monstrosities. There’s something quite liberating about this – unlike other shows, where the aim is always to find the very best (and the stress, screaming and emotional trauma is just collateral damage), Nailed It! revels in disaster, accepting the bakers for what they are: good people, trying their best, but with their cakes ultimately ruined by the unrealistic expectations of reality TV (and melting fondant).The entire show, in fact, is beautiful anarchy: it is to Bake Off what Mario Kart is to Formula One. There are “weapons” bakers can use against their fellow competitors – one of which is the Nicole Nags button, where Byer will run over to the other bakers and start distracting them by singing loudly in their ear, while another weapon means that all the advice bakers get from head judge Jacques Torres is delivered to them in French.It’s a show that seems to be falling apart at the seams: in the first episode, one of the judges gets bored and starts looking for alcohol in the pantry, while in the last episode, another judge genuinely gets a phone call midway through and has to leave to pick up his children. Are these moments real? Are they staged? Does it matter? Does any of this matter? Why are professional chefs judging a plate of soggy fluorescent goo that’s supposed to be a cocktail cake? Like all great surrealist satire, it makes us look at our own lives – the pressure we put on ourselves, the terrifying competition we agree to be a part of professionally, socially and romantically – and question exactly why we put up with it all.Under it all, this is the central argument of Nailed It!. There’s a kinder world out there – one that isn’t only driven by results, that doesn’t pit people against each other in a brutal dog-eat-dog world, that doesn’t perceive misery as a necessary sacrifice for success – if only we can find a way to stop measuring our self-worth through competition. It’s just that sometimes it takes a melting fondant cake in the shape of a giant piece of sushi for us to see that.• Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and performer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13de7366df29fd43ffa985d8fad75870a4fa1fe7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491511f7e0d812d2a1bc0ea260440722","title":"propaganda brexit fish eu britain fishing rights","story":"British skippers weren’t denied fair quotas by the EU, Britain let them sell their fishing rights to foreign boatsStanding on the shingle of Hastings beach beside his fishing boat, Paul Joy says his family have fished these waters since before the time of William the Conqueror. He’s done the research, and the Joys have had boats here since records began. His boat had been out at dawn that morning, hugging the coastline with a skipper, two crew and the “boy” ashore, aged 80, who winches the Kaya up the pebbles with a rusty bulldozer. “My father, Will, born in 1906, made an adequate living with a smaller boat than mine. Now everyone subsidises fishing with other work. I earned the same as a carpenter, now you’re lucky to get a Tesco shelf-stacker’s pay.” Fishing quotas are killing the small fishermen, he says.Stand here to breathe in the heart of Brexit. Last week, in ports around the country, fishing boats protested – sending up flares to oppose the transition deal that leaves them in the common fisheries policy (CFP), but\u0026nbspwithout a seat at the EU table sharing out the fish. Protest organisers said: “We are sickened by remainers gleefully peddling the deliberate narrative that fishing doesn’t matter.”Here the referendum was lost, in the romance of the sea, the rugged cliffs and coasts of our island story among old salt spirits of a seafaring nation. This is the symbolism the remainers fatally forgot, tone deaf to the draw of John Masefield’s poem Sea Fever or Millais’s The Boyhood of Raleigh. Economics says fishing is of nugatory value, but politics says fishing is deep-dyed in national identity, down to the last fish and chip shop. That heart-versus-head error is why remain lost – and why its campaigners still fail to connect with unreasoning national sentiments. They forget those sentiments can be cashable too: Hastings’ 27 picturesque boats, huts and fish stalls bring the impoverished town £5m a year in tourism.Joy heads the small-fishers’ organisation, Nutfa. He is a sharp campaigner, steeped in the fiendishly conflicting complexities of international fishing policy. If “take back control” meant anything, it was Britannia ruling her own waves. But that’s not going to happen, because it can’t.Michael Gove, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, casually promised instant freedom from the fisheries policy, but backed down embarrassingly when our know-nothing negotiators were taken by surprise (again) to find other EU fishing nations just as adamant: those with their own fierce fishing traditions feel just as passionately. Who knew?There always were and always will be fishing treaties between countries, now more than ever to preserve precarious stocks. Unless navies are to go to war to defend their fishing fleets, there must always be agreements. Fishing treaties existed before Britain joined the EU. Quotas fixed long ago often don’t seem fair now, nor do they preserve stocks well enough. But the EU is only one element: ask Grimsby fishers about friction between English and Scottish rights, as global warming sends cod migrating north. Fish don’t obey treaties.Gove has the power to do it, says Thomas Appleby, associate law professor at the University of the West of England, a fisheries law specialist. Britain could and should have banned the sale of its quotas, but Gove could repair some of the damage: so long as UK quota is taken back proportionally from all, shares could be redistributed to the small boats. Why doesn’t he do it? Joy points to the power of the big companies: two-thirds of UK quotas are taken by three multinationals. And he talks of business influence over the Conservatives. Here’s an irony: the EU fisheries fund has given Joy’s small boats lobby a grant to set up its own producer organisation as a political counterweight to fight the big\u0026nbspboats.At sea, the Brexiteers are coming face to face with hard truths: we are not alone. No man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent. We trade, we exchange, we buy and sell. Fish was a bad emblem for the hard Brexiteers to choose because it’s an archetypal example of the need for cooperation – in fishing, conservation and sales. Trade-offs, haggling, deals and environmental necessity demand treaties between us and our neighbours, in or out of the EU. Except that outside it, our negotiators have a weak hand. The romance of the sea was good referendum propaganda now it stands as the best example of why standing alone is impossible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6b5dd70ce8ce3e7fc315bd9fb8704ce17a281a/0_191_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb2d5c3f7e8bdee1d419d85b9422900","title":"veggie sausage food france ban","story":"France is banning producers of meat-substitute food from using words like ‘burger’ as it’s ‘misleading’. As double-standards go, this is a whopperMycoprotein, fusarium venenatum, fermentation, albumen, cultures, coagulating, curdling – these aren’t tasty words. Some of them are quite disgusting, actually. But if you’re vegan or vegetarian and incorporate meat substitutes into your daily diet, you’ll recognise them as the words in tiny font on the side of the packaging, you might even know how some of them are made. If you think about them too much, they can conjure up disturbing images of unformed Soylent growing in the dark, festering away like dark sludge to form unnatural shapes … We don’t have to think about all this, of course, because more palatable descriptors are used for the purposes of marketing, such as “bean curd sausage”, “tofu steak”. The name-substitutes given instead of “gelatinous fungus” are like kind lies distancing what we put in our mouths from the reality of how it came into being. But these kind lies appear to be on the way out, following the vote by French MPs on Thursday to ban producers of vegetarian meat substitute from using meat-related phrasing in their descriptions. Products not partly or wholly composed of meat can’t be “steak”, “bacon”, or “sausage” any longer, just in case it’s “misleading” for consumers. This assumes, though, that no one has ever tasted both meat and meat substitute. Because anyone who has tasted, seen, or smelled them both  knows. You know the difference between the look and texture of a meat steak – ribbons of white fat running through deep, pink flesh – and a meat-substitute steak – an amorphous beige lump that looks like it’s travelled from an outer limits hellscape.  Fake bacon? Nothing like actual bacon it’s a chewy slab of something (we can’t call it cardboard – cardboard has a texture) that vaguely tastes of bacon crisps, and smells a bit like cinnamon when cooked. Soya mince – cut-up rubber bands mixed with a yeasty flavour. If you use substitutes, you know what they are, and that they can be enjoyed just fine as part of a full meal. Some of us love them.  However, associating these products with meat – even with meaty words – just isn’t right, according to the new regulation. “It is important to combat false claims, our products must be designated correctly,” said French MP Jean-Baptiste Moreau on the issue. But since when has food been described correctly or honestly? Is there going to be a change across the whole of the food industry? Dairy milk isn’t going to be described on the bottle as “mammary secretions” (thank goodness), even though that’s what it is. Beef is not yet “carcass” or “body part”, and offal is not “viscera”. Pork has not become “parts of pig”.  Pig, cow, and sheep are more easily orced in the mind from what arrives on plates when they’re called “pork”, “beef”, and “mutton” instead (just ask the children  who don’t know that bacon comes from pigs, or  what fish fingers are made of). You don’t have to think about it if you don’t want to. “Sausage”, “burger” and “steak” further remove the foodstuff from the animal they come from. They’re words that make the disconcerting worth eating – also lies, of a sort. They’re not as big as a  Soylent Green lie, but they’re not upfront honesty either. It turns out that the truth just isn’t tasty, whether you eat meat or not. I don’t want to eat a tofu tube, instead of a sausage. Or disks, or balls, spheres, slop, chunks – I’m running out of words that could be used to describe coagulated soy milk pressed into white blocks of matter. I like the shorthand of words like “sausage” and “steak” for substitutes, because I don’t want to eat something that sounds like it came out of a horror film. If meat producers can distance consumers from the reality of where their products come from, the substitute industry should be able to do the same. Otherwise, what will we all eat instead when confronted with the unvarnished truth of what our food is? An apple?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9537cbebecc9169cf6f1a4830fa6ad39005abf1/0_391_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54425e5d3967a9d0210b1ef85f7df937","title":"seven ways to avoid hair loss","story":"There are two clinically approved drugs for preventing further hair loss – finasteride and minoxidil. Finasteride works by inhibiting the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which causes the hair follicles to shrink and eventually fall out, while minoxidil increases blood flow and nutrient uptake to the follicles. Both treatments may result in some hair regrowth as well, but they include the risk of side-effects. Finasteride has been found to lead to erectile dysfunction and decreased libido in approximately 1 in 31 men, while minoxidil can result in skin irritation and allergic reactions.Apart from finasteride and minoxidil, laser combs are the only hair-loss treatment to have received FDA approval. (In the UK, the medication and the combs have to be paid for privately as they are not available on the NHS.) A 2014 study of 103 men with pattern hair loss found a significant increase in hair density after 26 weeks of applying a laser comb across the scalp three times a week. The exact way the combs work isn’t fully understood, but it has been suggested that low-power lasers have an antioxidant effect on hair follicles.There is some evidence that many gels and other styling products may contribute to hair loss, as the chemicals within these products stay on the scalp and become trapped in the follicles, preventing the hair from coming to the surface. Avoid excessive use of hair gels and try more natural styling products, which contain fewer chemicals.Overly hot showers can cause damage to the scalp by stripping it of the essential oils that help to protect it, causing dryness and inflammation. There is no direct evidence that hot showers lead to hair loss, but some believe that scalp inflammation can result in miniaturisation of the hair follicles and thinning hair.Some studies have suggested that scalp massage has the potential to increase hair density by improving blood circulation to the scalp and hair follicles, as well as increasing the activity of genes known to promote hair growth. An additional benefit is that massage helps to lower stress levels, another factor relating to hair loss.If you already have significant hair loss, a transplant may be your best bet. Before hair loss, we have about 100,000 hairs at least 25,000 are required to give the appearance of a relatively complete head of hair. The transplant process involves taking hair follicles from the DHT-resistant “donor” regions at the back and sides of the head, and grafting them on to the scalp. There are many different hair transplant techniques, but some of the newer methods use hair stem cells to stimulate regrowth in the donor area, allowing for repeated transplantations if necessary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d76d89edc88d7c902e5961f751cc848478c067e/678_209_2318_1391/master/2318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f6057a1a7f0a1aad5ede7a729ae8c9","title":"verne troyer life in pictures","story":"Verne Troyer, who at 2ft 8in was one of the world’s shortest men, racked up 30 film credits in a career ning 24 years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0217eb62c6bb14f360a9833d09a17cdfe15c7a8a/0_300_4585_2751/master/4585.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e455cece7a7fa7bb28149e5e886b5b58","title":"andres iniesta begins barcelona goodbye as an era draws to a close","story":"Departing legend belongs to us all – tears, applause and another moment of quiet awe marked a fitting cup final farewellThere were two minutes to go in the final, his final, when Andrés Iniesta began the long walk goodbye.Slowly, swallowing hard, eyes red, he made his way across the pitch, team-mates coming to embrace him as he went, and all around the Metropolitano supporters got to their feet, applauding. They stood in the Barcelona end and they stood in the Sevilla end too. Iniesta’s name rolled around, accompanying him until he ducked out of sight, taking a seat on the bench. He sat there for a little while, tears forcing their way through, and then he got up again and went to collect the Copa del Rey, alone.It was the 34th title of his career and a 35th will follow, but it was this one that felt like it marked the end: the last waltz. As he climbed up to collect the trophy, down on the grass Barcelona’s players waited for him, much as they had waited for him when, 51 minutes into his 670th game for Barcelona, he scored the fourth goal, ensuring that this would always be his night: the Iniesta Final.Collecting Lionel Messi’s pass, with a gentle shift of the hips, just a hint of a pause, he stepped past David Soria and rolled the ball in. He jumped into the air and at some point in that leap, sadness crept into the celebration, nostalgia flooding the stadium. They knew what this meant.Any doubt disappeared when they saw the Barcelona’s players’ reaction, more eloquent than anything they could have said. “There were a lot of emotions in that goal,” Iniesta admitted afterwards. “Lots of emotions, lots of feelings, lots of years. I really wanted this final to go well and I’m happy.” The normal huddle broke up and then, almost one by one, they waited for Iniesta, a moment each. Eyes closed, Messi held him in an embrace that may become the image of the final, maybe even a generation he held on just that little bit longer, like he didn’t want to let go.There was something in that. In good times and bad Messi looks for Iniesta, and in bad times above all. It is in those moments when he seeks security, assurance, that he most wants the Spaniard at his side. “I know how difficult it is to do what he does,” Messi says in Iniesta’s book, The Artist.“On the pitch I like him to be near me, especially when the game takes a turn for the worse, when things are difficult. That’s when I say to him: ‘come closer’. He takes control and responsibility.”It is a simple solution, successful for well over a decade and expressed on Saturday night, like a portrait of their era, Barcelona producing a performance that may have been as good as any since Wembley 2011. And yet time waits for no man, not even the man who sometimes seemed able to control it. You can slow the clock, but not stop it and when Messi looks for Iniesta next season, he will no longer be there he’ll be 5,000 miles away. 22 years after arriving, 18 after meeting Messi, 16 since his debut, Iniesta is leaving Barcelona he’s leaving Spain too, for China. An announcement is expected this week.At 33, a starter in 24 of 33 league games and eight of 10 in the Champions League, on course to win a league and cup double, it may have come to soon. That, certainly, was the conclusion drawn after Saturday night. China looks incongruous. The headline on the front of AS on Sunday morning said it all: “Iniesta, don’t go!” But the appeals for him to stay, while they express that hope that he might yet change his mind, will also reinforce his belief that this is the right time to go. The right way, too: remember me like this.Although Iniesta wouldn’t say so, something broke last year, and while a momentary fix was found, a “lifetime” contract signed and his role renewed, he didn’t want to leave too late, a long goodbye from the bench. Nor did he ever want to face the club he joined aged 12.Iniesta described that day in September 1996 when he arrived at La Masia as the worst of his life. José Bermúdez, another resident, remembered him as “pale, tiny and sad, delicate and sensitive”. Iniesta couldn’t stop crying. A few hundred metres away in the Hotel Rallye, nor could his parents. His father, José Antonio, couldn’t sleep and the same went for Andrés’s grandfather. Together, they planned to go and get him, take him home. Mari, Iniesta’s mum, stopped them. “Let him try,” she insisted. So, they did.They took him to school the next morning and then headed home to La Mancha. Iniesta felt abandoned when they weren’t there to pick him up that afternoon. Victor Valdés was there at the start. “His success was forged through silent tears,” Valdés says. It is some success: 34 titles, soon to be 35, his departure accompanied by another double. There have been two trebles as well, and the World Cup and the European Championship, twice in a row. Which makes it sound almost as easy as his football makes it look, but it hasn’t been.Iniesta does not use the word depression but he has spoken eloquently about the “dark place” he was in after the 2010 World Cup, how he felt in “freefall”. He went into the 2009 Champions League final with a hole in his thigh, ordered not to shoot. He reached the World Cup struggling with injury, running around hotel corridors in the middle of the night, unseen by team-mates, trying to prove his fitness to himself. It says something that Vicente Del Bosque said he would wait for him, as long as it took it says something too that when he suffered an injury 17 days before the 2009 final, Pep Guardiola insisted: “He plays.”He played, the way only Iniesta could, the way that became symbolic of a generation: arguably the best that football in Spain, maybe anywhere, has seen. “An era departs with him,” said AS’s match report. “A style, too. A way of playing and a way of life.” After Rome, Alex Ferguson talked about how “he and Xavi get you on that carrousel” and he experienced that again at Wembley in 2011, an era-defining display revived on Saturday.In South Africa, he scored the winning goal, 116 minutes into the final, peeling off his shirt to reveal a vest underneath. “Dani Jarque, always with us,” it said, written by the physio Hugo before kick-off for Iniesta to wear in honour of the Eyol captain, his friend, who had passed away after a sudden unexpected heart attack. Jarque’s wife Jessica watched the match on TV, her first in a year since his death. “Seconds before the goal, I knew it was coming. I started to cry before you scored,” she told Iniesta. As the ball sat up, he said he heard “the silence”.And then he scored. The goal.“Iniesta is leaving us,” ran one headline last week the key word was “us”.Iniesta is applauded at every stadium in Spain, but it is not just because of that goal and it is not just Spain. It happened in Turin and Lisbon too, and at the Santiago Bernabéu. On Saturday, it happened again it was not the first time but it felt like the last, a touch of melancholy. It is not just him, it is what he represents. “The last emperor,” Marca called him. “How happy he made us. Something in your soul dies when a friend goes nothing will ever be the same,” one editorial read last week – and that too was in Madrid.Iniesta belongs to everybody, like some shared treasure, held close but enjoyed together. Luis Enrique called him “world heritage”. When the goal went in on Saturday, on Cadena Ser radio the commentator joined those chanting his name. “The scriptwriter has done it this final needed this moment,” Lluis Flaquer said. “Iniesta! Iniesta! Iniesta! We can’t leave here without joining in the chant, which is the chant of all football lovers, dedicated to a universal manchego.”It is the player and the person, the way he is, that helps explain that. He is every man’s in part because he is everyman: there’s a normality about him which is not entirely normal in football, and he is universally admired. “He’s an amazingly good person someone kicks him and he’s the one who says sorry,” Samuel Eto’o insists. Sergio Ramos disagrees: “You can’t kick him it’s Andrés,” he says.After Spain defeated Croatia at Euro 2012, Ivan Rakitic, still not the club-mate he would become said: “We can play against all of them, but against Iniesta it is different. He is another level again. He has everything: he’s so fast, he thinks so quickly, he’s in control.” That day, Fernando Torres noted: “When he has the ball, it’s like everything else stops, like the camera is going in slow motion. I’ve known him for 15 years and he’s never, ever had a bad game.” On Saturday, Vicenzo Montella described him as an “extra-terrestrial”.Sometimes, though, it’s more than words. Some years ago now, Iniesta was recording a video, explaining to the camera as he walked through the move where he shifts the ball from one foot to another and back again. He came to the defender, a fellow Barcelona player, and went past him. Swish, swish, and he was gone. He was “walking” everyone through it but it still happened so fast as to be almost imperceptible. There was something of that in Saturday’s goal the ball doesn’t even change direction much the defender does, as if Iniesta is controlling him too. That day, there were only five or six people there but there was an audible gasp – from professional players.“Bloody hell,” one spat out.There is work behind it but Iniesta believes it’s intuitive. “What I did at 12, I still do now,” he says. What he does delights it also creates a sense of quiet awe, even among those for whom football holds fewer secrets. Vicente Del Bosque says it is like he is watching the game from the stands while still on the pitch, a player of “uncommon intelligence and awareness”. Paco Seirulo, fitness coach at Barcelona, talked about his “mastery of the relationship between space and time.” When Louis Van Gaal gave him his debut, he said: “There’s the pitch. It’s yours. Play.” He played. And play is the word.The day that Iniesta was first invited to train, Luis Enrique was sent to pick him up at the gate because otherwise the security guard, Antonio, wouldn’t have let him past. Luis Enrique later called him “Harry Potter” but doesn’t recall it, despite Pep Guardiola urging team-mates: “Remember this day, the day you first played with Andrés.” Guardiola knew he’d been encouraged by his brother Pere to see Iniesta a few years before. As he left, he came across a friend. “I’ve just seen something incredible,” he said. That day, Guardiola also famously told Xavi: “You’re going to retire me. This lad is going to retire us all.” Now, after 670 games, Iniesta is going too. He goes like this, playing his way.“He’s a phenomenon, a force of nature: no one plays like him and no one can compare to him,” wrote Xavi, the man who was closer to him than any other, who with Iniesta defined a generation. “Sometimes I get the feeling that Andrés doesn’t realise how important he is: one day he’ll retire and we’ll see the magnitude of what he has done.” He surely knows now, as that day draws closer: he saw it on Saturday. “It’s emotional to see the affection and respect people have for me,” he said.There is not long left, they know. Soon, maybe too soon, Lionel Messi will look across and see an empty space. They all will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7c23cc671fb220dcebd630eb973b53fb3dd3b5/1224_600_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3267e83ea1f68b136cb95e016f216389","title":"brexit makes no sense and britain should vote again says jurgen klopp","story":"Jürgen Klopp, the manager of Liverpool, has told the  that Brexit “makes no sense at all” and that he believes British people should have the chance to vote again on their future either in or outside the European Union. “The two leaders of the leave campaign then stepped aside. It was a pure sign they were surprised themselves by the vote. OK, that can happen. But then, come on, let’s sit together again. Let’s think about it again and let’s vote again with the right information – not with the information you’ve got around the Brexit campaign. They were obviously not right, not all of them. It makes no sense at all.”In the  interview Klopp reveals how he has embraced life in Liverpool and stresses he is proud that his squad, unlike most Premier League clubs, has a strong core of English players. He stresses that, “the English guys lead the group. Tottenham and us we are pretty much the English national team and I like that.”“But it’s only because the pound is not that strong anymore. The EU is not perfect but it was the best idea we had. History has always shown that when we stay together we can sort out problems. When we split then we start fighting.

That’s less holiday than I have which means that’s absolutely not my target.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4924510338c7a9309733af42528994edfca6d66/0_121_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c57cfb7fec5f4b16c98e43f4e04c21b4","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool champions league roma mo salah brexit","story":"Exclusive: Liverpool’s manager discusses the Champions League semi-final against Roma, a three-hour chat with Mo Salah, his health scare ... and BrexitJürgen Klopp is calm and serene. His face lights up, of course, at the prospect of “the mighty battle” which awaits Liverpool on Tuesday when Roma arrive at Anfield for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final. He also leans forward animatedly when assessing the intriguing challenge the Italians will pose. Yet, beyond the cliche of Klopp as a madly gurning cheerleader on the touchline, the 50-year-old German proved, again, his tactical nous and inspirational management while guiding Liverpool to three victories this season over the feted Premier League champions Manchester City. The 5-1 aggregate defeat of City in the quarter-finals was exhilarating and resilient.It is striking how, at Liverpool’s training ground, Klopp is also stimulated when discussing real life and tangled politics, Brexit and Angela Merkel. There are moments in a free-wheeling conversation when the hilarity feels unstoppable as Klopp considers a claim that he would win an election to become German chancellor because of his attention to detail, communication skills and empathy. But there are many more thoughtful moments – particularly when Klopp addresses the vexed issue of Brexit and his belief that British people should have the chance to vote again on their future in or outside the EU.We start, however, with Klopp reminiscing about his youthful desire to become a doctor. That teenage ambition chimes with his persistent interest in helping people “get better every day” and his work with players, from Mo Salah to Dejan Lovren, who improve in contrasting ways. “I was young when I thought about becoming a doctor,” Klopp says with a smile as he remembers growing up in the Black Forest village of Glatten. “I had the idea three years before my A-level. But to study medicine your A-level results had to be fantastic. So it was good for all the people who would have been under my knife that I didn’t make it. But it was close to be honest.”That wistful sentence is swamped by his laughter. But the idea of Dr Klopp is not outlandish. He exudes a warmth and intelligence we would all want to see in a doctor. “I have this helping syndrome,” Klopp says. “I really care about people and I feel responsible for pretty much everything.”Klopp’s inclusive leadership, ensuring everyone feels nurtured and needed, is at the root of his success. Is he also becoming a scouser as his immersion in Liverpool runs so deep? Klopp grins, brandishing his cup: “There’s this tea, for example. When we come somewhere new my family like to adapt. We want to live like people here. I’m not a guy who says: ‘By the way, I want to tell you in Germany we do it like this or that.’ We look so similar but we are very different too. It’s really interesting. My boys both work in Germany but they are football maniacs so they’re very often here. They tell me about the nightlife and I experience the country in the daytime.”Does life on this small island seem insular, particularly when the political landscape has shifted dramatically since he arrived? “I’ve heard it said that English people are not looking outwards but I don’t see it. I live in Formby and work in Liverpool. I drive from here to there and sometimes I’m in different cities for games. So I don’t know enough about the country but many people come to Britain because English is the language the world speaks.“The two leaders of the Leave campaign then stepped aside. It was a pure sign they were surprised themselves by the vote. OK, that can happen. But then, come on, let’s sit together again. Let’s think about it again and let’s vote again with the right information – not with the information you’ve got around the Brexit campaign. They were obviously not right, not all of them. It makes no sense at all.This embrace of Europe does not mean Klopp is disparaging towards British footballers. More than most Premier League clubs he has an English core to his squad. Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Nathaniel Clyne, Dominic Solanke and Danny Ings are joined by other bright young talents such as Scotland’s Andrew Robertson and Wales’ Ben Woodburn.“They are here because they’re really good – not because they’re English or British. But if you have two players at the same level and one is English and the other is from somewhere else I always go for the English guy. They keep the mood good and for them it’s easy to feel the club’s history. But we have fantastic boys from all over the world and they love the club. Roberto Firmino has such a Liverpool heart. But the English guys lead the group. Tottenham and us we are pretty much the English national team and I like that.”Did he spend much time assessing Salah’s character before signing him? “I always meet the player before we sign. That’s when I decide because I have a good feeling for people. It was a fantastic talk. He’s open, smiling all the time. He has crazy curls but he’s a really nice boy. He also looked much more mature than it says on his passport. Twenty-four? I was: ‘Wow, really?’ We talked for three hours about everything from his family to my family and at the end we had a deal to work together. I like to remind players from time to time of that agreement. It’s working really well with Mo.”Lovren has had a more testing season and mistakes against Spurs and Manchester United meant that many Liverpool fans denounced him. But his resurgence has been marked and, against City, he was a clear leader. “There are some really difficult things in Liverpool,” Klopp says. “The whole Liverpool family is not happy with not winning big trophies since whenever – so you always find a reason. ‘The problem is we don’t spend enough.’ Or, ‘The players make mistakes’. So, really, it’s a difficult job to be Liverpool’s goalkeeper. I’m not sure who was the last goalkeeper everybody was happy with here. It would be a while ago. And if you are not Sami Hyypia then your life as a defender is also difficult.“I don’t exactly know about Dejan’s start at Liverpool but he made a few mistakes. People always have that in mind: ‘Oh, Lovren again!’ But I’m long in the business. I said to Dejan: ‘If somebody told me, come on, you have the chance, create a centre-half. We found a way to do it, genetically, bam, bam, bam.’ That’s him, strong, quick, both feet, can head like crazy, jumps through the roof. He’s all you need. Yes, a few things you can improve – his concentration. But these are human beings.“Other centre-halves make mistakes. Against City, Virgil van Dijk, an outstanding person and fantastic player, should have cleared the ball before they scored. Virgil knows that. But nobody spoke about it because we won. It doesn’t look like it but I’m really relaxed in judging these things. When I see talent, and I’m convinced, I am calm.”It helps that Klopp has been here before although, when we remember our previous interview, before Dortmund lost to Bayern Munich in the 2013 Champions League final, he grimaces. “I’ve never watched it back. It’s too painful.”Manchester City felt Champions League pain against Liverpool – but soothed themselves by winning the league with five games to spare. How close are Liverpool to a concerted tilt at City’s title next season? “It’s an interesting question because while we improved a lot they do the same. You can’t imagine that City, after a brilliant season, will say: ‘Oh, that’s so good we’ll keep the same squad.’ They will find new players. I also noticed an interesting thing. Their club has more money than every club in the world but I saw the City boys celebrating in a really nice way in the pub. It showed a real team.”It has been another draining season but Klopp looks fit and well. He was said to have suffered a minor health scare in November when he went to hospital. “We all go for a check now and then but nobody knows. It was actually a funny situation. They tried to bring me in through the back door but the security guy has a walkie-talkie and he says: ‘Klopp is in the house!’ But, really, I’m fine. I love the job but if somebody told me: ‘If you carry on you will die much earlier’ then I’d say immediately: ‘Thank you. I’m on the road home.’”He looks intrigued when I point out that, after spending seven years each at Mainz and Dortmund as manager, his Liverpool contract runs until 2022. He will then have completed a third seven-year stint at a club with whom he has fallen in love. “The seven years is a coincidence. When you have a marriage and if you’re past your seventh year then you’re OK. But, actually, I don’t need this kind of settling. It’s not in my nature. But when I am in a club I am in it totally.”Liverpool are lucky to have him but, thinking of that seven-year cycle, I joke with Klopp that some people have another job in mind for him. Martin Quast, a German sportswriter, said: “If Klopp wanted to run for German president, he would get elected. He would bring people together, lead the way, make people happy.”After Klopp has stopped laughing he explains that Quast is from Mainz. “Maybe in 2004 I could have been chancellor of Mainz. But I have absolutely no skills apart from being interested in politics. I would enjoy it if a politician spoke like a normal person but the job is complex. So we should care about our good people in politics because there’re not many of them. It’s like being a football manager. Many people are interested in football but only a few combine all the skills. Politics is even more difficult. I could never do it – or want to do it.”Klopp as German chancellor would still be fun and maybe he could find a way to help Brexit Britain. “Hmmm,” Klopp says with mock seriousness. “Angela Merkel has two weeks off a year. That’s less holiday than I have which means that’s absolutely not my target. On holiday everybody is following her. She’s in the mountains having a nice hike and every year the same picture of Angela and her husband. I really like her and she’s doing an unbelievable job. But it’s a very difficult job – which is not as well paid as a football manager either. I will stick with Liverpool.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab399a313b82737925e2d060dffb682d2a7a78d9/0_30_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=211515e463470702fb6fa99399b88235","title":"napoli juventus maradona serie a title race","story":"‘Mamma miaaaa!!!’ described this 1-0 win best. Not since Maradona wore the shirt have Napoli known times like theseTell a story in two words. Diego Maradona did his best in the moments that followed Napoli’s stunning 1-0 victory over Juventus in Turin on Sunday night, logging in to Facebook and hammering in a phrase screamed everywhere from a Mediaset Premium commentary box to the bars and piazze of Naples (in the latter case: with a few extra expletives laced in). “Mamma miaaaa!!!”Not since Maradona himself wore the shirt have Napoli known times like these. By the time the Partenopei touched down back at Capodichino airport, the crowd awaiting them was reported to have swelled to as many as 10,000 people.Their flight had been delayed by 90 minutes to allow local authorities to get a grip on the situation from a security standpoint. Napoli landed at 1.30am, but it was past 4am before their team bus started to pull clear of the throng. Even then, an informal convoy of mopeds and cars trailing scarves and flags accompanied them on the drive back toward their Castel Volturno training ground. Similar scenes had played out in reverse a day earlier, thousands gathering outside Napoli’s Stadio San Paolo to lend the team a proper send-off before it travelled north. All this for a game that could not change their position in the league standings. Win or lose, Napoli would end the day in second place.And yet, when Kalidou Koulibaly rose to break the deadlock with a 90-minute header, everything really did seem to change. Four days earlier, Napoli had been losing at home to Udinese while Juventus led away at Crotone. If those results had held, the gap at the top would have widened to nine points. Instead, by the end of Sunday, it was down to just one.Juventus still lead the way, still have control of their own destiny. But their remaining four games include away trips to face Inter and Roma: both fighting tooth and nail for a Champions League berth. Napoli’s schedule is not exactly soft, with visits to Fiorentina and Sampdoria still to come, as well as home fixtures against Torino and Crotone. If offered the chance, though, would they really trade places?It is not simply a question of the fixture list, either. The impact of this win went beyond what you could read in the standings. A month earlier, following a win over Genoa, manager Maurizio Sarri responded to a question about whether his team could win the title by saying that “if it was up to me we would go to the palace and seize power.”The Allianz Stadium has not so much been a palace as a fortress for Juventus, a place where they previously lost just seven games in as many years. The Bianconeri had faced Napoli six times here in the league, winning on every occasion. To break such a run could hardly fail to leave a psychological impact.Reminded of his words on Sunday, Sarri initially tried to turn them back on journalists, saying “that supposes Juventus are the power. That’s you saying that.” But he extended the thought by agreeing. “They are a team who have won the Scudetto for six years in a row, they represent the technical power, and in my opinion some other power too, so they are the team everybody wants to beat.” Napoli never gave Juventus a moment to settle. Lorenzo Insigne could have put them in front in the very first minute, darting between two defenders to reach a deflected cross but getting his shot all wrong under pressure for Giorgio Chiellini. The defender hyper-extended his knee in the challenge and limped out of the game 10 minutes later. His departure was a blow for the hosts, but it can hardly explain their failure to register a shot on target for the first time ever in this venue.Napoli were imperfect, even ragged at times, yet they fought to sustain an active high press, routinely sending as many as three players to smother the opponent in possession. You got the impression that they were enjoying their status as underdogs, after appearing in some recent games to be weighed down by the expectation that they must always win against lesser opponents.The goal hardly felt inevitable – if anything, we are more accustomed to seeing Juventus find a way to steal a decisive moment in games such as this – yet it was a just reward for the only team that truly tried to win. There was something poetic about the fact that it should be scored by Koulibaly, a towering giant in a team most famous for its trio of “marvellous smurfs” up front.“Juventus are still in front and so almost nothing changes,” insisted Sarri afterwards. “We just need to think about the match in Florence, Juventus are in front and our chances are very slim.”He was not fooling anyone. The fireworks continued long into the night in Naples, fans flooding the streets and squares far away from the airport, too, while delirious pizzaioli served up free dinners.The night had started on a rather less edifying note, Sarri caught showing a middle finger to Juventus fans as Napoli’s team bus arrived at the stadium. Rather than apologise afterwards, he clarified that his gesture was not aimed at the club’s fans in general, but merely those who “were spitting at us and insulting us because we are Neapolitan”.His unrefined manner is not always appreciated outside of Naples but then, wasn’t the same true of Maradona? If he and his players can see this dream through to its conclusion, they will earn a place every bit as indelible in club lore.• A quietly very impressive win for Roma, as they geared up for their Champions League semi-final against Liverpool. Spal were unbeaten in eight, yet Eusebio Di Francesco still dared to rest a number of starters. Roma even got a goal from Patrik Schick, the striker finally breaking his duck.• And in case you hadn’t spotted it, I had the chance to sit down with Di Francesco over the weekend for a one-on-one – talking about that semi-final, but also the importance of having fun in football, the psychological impact of a three-man defence and the differences between this Roma team and the one that lifted the Scudetto in 2001. • The race for those last two Champions League places, though, remains as tight as ever. Lazio thrashed Sampdoria, with Ciro Immobile becoming the first Italian since Antonio Di Natale to score 29 goals in a Serie A season. Inter were less impressive but they stepped up a gear in the second half and remain one point behind the two Rome clubs.• What a mess at Udinese, who were pushing for Europe in February but find themselves at risk of relegation now after an 11th consecutive defeat – this one at home to Crotone. Gino Pozzo, who in recent times has devoted more of his time and energy to Watford, flew back to Italy last week to attempt to get a handle on the situation, and now faces a delicate decision over whether to stick by manager Massimo Oddo with only four games left.• Crotone’s win spelled the end for Benevento, mathematically relegated just a day after they had beaten Milan at San Siro. It will go down as one of calcio’s more peculiar footnotes that the Witches were unbeaten in two games against the Rossoneri in this, their first-ever top-flight season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f586379d540da2815618f62728aa8fa78218f7/0_0_620_372/master/620.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757e889fcf245cd905e9e8a23f0a470d","title":"fa cup and premier league talking points from the weekend","story":"Harry Kane is out of sorts, Joe Hart soars before being floored, and Stoke must choose between youth and experience up frontWhile Southampton will take something from getting this far in the world’s most celebrated domestic cup competition there are other, more pressing priorities, such as making a late dash for safety in the Premier League. Can they take any hope from their performance? Not from the first half. Olivier Giroud’s goal at the beginning of the second period forced Mark Hughes to change things, however, and it was to his team’s benefit. A 3-5-2 became a 3-4-3 and suddenly Charlie Austin was getting service. Southampton will feel they could and should have had an equaliser before Chelsea settled the game, with Austin the likely outlet. The substitutes Dusan Tadic and Nathan Redmond, meanwhile, were assertive and threatening. Southampton need that level of performance again, from the first whistle, against Bournemouth next weekend. Paul MacInnes• Pochettino: ‘Maybe next season we play the FA Cup with kids’When José Mourinho arrived at Chelsea he ensured he had a solid foundation at the back on which to build, bringing the trusted Paulo Ferreira and Ricardo Carvalho from Porto. On Saturday Manchester United’s back five comprised players purchased by Sir Alex Ferguson, who stepped down five years ago. The ageing Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young have both been successfully redeployed from attacking roles but their longevity is unknown. David De Gea is now one of the best Premier League goalkeepers but the much-maligned Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are still the most trusted defenders as David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho have all failed to acquire a consistent centre-back to oust them, forcing Mourinho to rely on the old guard, who thoroughly justified their selection at Wembley even if they have faltered this season. This summer’s defensive transfer movements will be critical. Will UnwinThe Arsenal players continued to talk of winning the Europa League for Arsène Wenger – in order to afford him the send-off he deserves – and it was difficult not to view this Premier League win through the prism of Thursday’s semi-final first leg against Atlético Madrid. Mohamed Elneny’s nasty-looking injury will deprive Wenger of a midfield option if he goes with a 4-3-3 formation while the manager will hope that Petr Cech, Mesut Özil, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Jack Wilshere can return. The biggest positive here was Alexandre Lacazette, who scored twice. It is now six goals in six appearances for the striker since his return from knee surgery and the way that he took his second, in particular – a drop of the shoulder, burst and low finish – pointed to a level of ruthlessness and confidence that will be needed against Atlético. David HytnerJoe Hart was left forlorn, not for the first time this season, but he will be especially frustrated by the fact he briefly proved why he is a Premier League champion and the owner of 75 England caps. With the scores at 1-1 he made two world class saves. Hart first denied a powerful Granit Xhaka drive, which forced him to e full stretch to his left, the side many see as his main weakness, with his fingers flicking the ball beyond the post. He replicated the acrobatics minutes later when Danny Welbeck curled a shot from 18 yards with the same impressive result. Unfortunately for Hart, he was the victim of Declan Rice ducking out of a header to help Arsenal regain the lead and then the goalkeeper’s confidence dropped as he failed to deal with two Alexandre Lacazette shots, leaving the scoreline flattering and Hart, once again, flattened. Will UnwinTwo January signings excelled for Stoke here. Badou Ndiaye gave the central midfield solidity and thrust, as well as scoring his first goal since his £14m arrival from Galatasaray. Moritz Bauer, a right-back, did well as a makeshift left winger. His cross should have led to a goal that might have secured a precious win, but Mame Birame Diouf fluffed it. Which brings us to the signing that Stoke did not make in January or at any other time in the last three years: a regular goalscorer, which despite the arrivals of Saido Berahino, Joselu and Wilfried Bony, has been a big factor in Stoke’s decline. Paul Lambert says his team must win all three of their remaining matches to survive. His choice is whether to put his faith in Tyrese Campbell, an 18-year-old who has been scoring prolifically for the club’s Under-23s, or continue hoping that Peter Crouch can fire Stoke to safety. Paul Doyle If Roy Hodgson is right and Wilfried Zaha’s reputation is costing him dearly, then the Crystal Palace forward has a real problem. His reaction to the harsh yellow card for simulation in the second half against Watford at Vicarage Road on Saturday was an indication of how frustrated Zaha is becoming with the perceived lack of protection he receives from referees. The Ivory Coast international certainly splits opinion among supporters as well. Given his ability, however, most would probably still welcome him at their club and Hodgson will know that without their talisman Palace’s season could have turned out very differently. The challenge will be to retain him this summer in the face of serious interest from several bigger sides, while Zaha must decide if he needs to leave Selhurst Park to fulfil his true potential. Ed AaronsA big part of West Bromwich Albion’s mini-revival under the stewardship of Darren Moore has been the togetherness the first-team coach has been preaching. But on Saturday, with 20 minutes to play, Jonny Evans was roundly booed after replacing James McClean, who was nursing a stomach bug. Was it a combination of his role in Taxigate, his underwhelming performances since speculation over a January move, or a combination of both? Either way, it was hardly helpful, even if Moore insisted it was a managerial masterstroke given Evans’s role in the set piece that kickstarted the comeback. “It worked an absolute treat, so tactically it was absolutely spot on,” Moore said. With Ahmed Hegazi likely to face retrospective action by the Football Association for appearing to punch Danny Ings in the chest, Evans may yet be promoted to the starting XI at Newcastle on Saturday. Ben FisherDanny Ings’s move to Liverpool was a dream one for a man who spent time on loan at Dorchester Town in 2010. Five years later he headed to Anfield in the hope of making his mark at a top Premier League club after a fine four years with Burnley. But his time in Liverpool has been a nightmare, mainly because of injury. Under Jürgen Klopp, Ings has endured constant misfortune, sustaining an anterior cruciate injury in his first training session with the German in October 2016, missing nine months, then a year later damaging cartilage in his right knee, forcing him out for 11 months. Klopp has shown great faith in him recently and his first goal in two-and-a-half years could be the boost he needs to show he can be a key squad player next season or give him the confidence required to restart his career elsewhere after three tough years.

There are on average about 250 babies born every minute – more than 130 million in a year. It is projected that there will be 11 billion people by 2100. New UN figures are due out in June. Most national governments make their own population projections. The United Nations and the World Bank figures are the most widely used globally. Since the 1960s, more boys than girls have been born every year. About 117 million women are believed to be “missing” in Asia and eastern Europe – due to discriminatory son preference and gender-biased sex selection.Where is the population rising fastest – and slowest?Broadly speaking, the fastest population rises are being recorded in Africa and Asia, which will have 15 of the 20 most populous nations by 2050. By that year, there will be more Nigerians than Americans. By 2100, it is projected that as many as one-third of all people – almost 4 billion – will be African.At the other end of the scale, population growth has stalled – or even gone into reverse – in parts of western Europe, Japan and Russia. Are these numbers sustainable?A nuanced question. Experts like Paul Ehrlich argue that the population of the world has long since surpassed optimal levels, though critics counter that consumption is as important as population levels.Some believe the very argument about overpopulation is controversial as it tends to point the finger at poorer parts of the world with large growth rates, and not at richer regions, which use disproportionately high amounts of resources.The fertility rate is the number of children born for every woman of childbearing age in a population. The things that tend to affect it include female empowerment, wellbeing and the status of children, technological and economic changes, and opportunities for family planning.The level of education in a society – of women in particular – is one of the most important predictors for the number of children families have.The global average fertility rate is just below 2.5 children per woman today. Over the last 50 years the global fertility rate has halved, as some of these factors bore down on family sizes. In the pre-modern era, fertility rates of 4.5 to 7 children per woman were common. At that time high mortality rates of young people kept population growth low. As health improved, the population growth rate began to soar, only flattening out as the fertility rate declined towards 2 children per woman.Africa has the lowest percentage of women using contraceptives, and the highest unmet need in the world. Despite this, some African countries have made the biggest leaps in contraception use over the past 40 years and are projected to make the greatest gains in the next 15.If birthrates have fallen so far, why is the population still rising fast?Of course, fertility rates are just half the story. People are living longer – far longer in some parts of the world. About 55m people die every year, which is less than half the number who are born. The number of children who die before reaching their fifth birthday has fallen to an all-time low: it is currently less than half what it was in 1990.A child’s chance of survival is still vastly different depending on where they are born. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest under-five mortality rate – 79 deaths for every 1,000 births, which means that one child in 13 die before their fifth birthday. This compares with six for every 1,000 in Europe and northern America and four for every 1,000 in Australia and New Zealand.At the same time, life expectancy is higher than 80 in 30 countries and higher than 70 in more than 100 countries.So what is the demographic idend?Countries that do succeed in reducing fertility rates can benefit from a demographic idend, where there are more people in work than children to support.Where you have a rapid decline in fertility, the younger population is no longer growing as fast and the economy should receive a boost because the number of workers per child increases, and that should provide a period of rapid economic growth. This was the experience in the east Asian “tiger” countries like South Korea and Taiwan in the 70s. Now countries such as China and India are benefiting from a demographic idend.A young population offers a lot of potential for the development of a country, but only if their talents are realised through investment. If there is little support given to young people to develop the skills they need as they enter the labour market, then the economy misses out. Isn’t it problematic that western populations are declining?Another global demographic shift is ageing populations in developed countries such as Japan and Germany, and also in advanced developing countries. In nations as erse as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia and Vietnam, the population aged over 60 will triple by 2050. This year, the number of people worldwide who are over 60 will rise above 1 billion for the first time. By 2050, it is forecast to be 2 billion. This raises the question: who will pay for them?Falling birth rates can mean fewer young workers entering the labour force at a time when the healthcare and social support costs associated with ageing are likely to rise.But ageing populations can be a cause for celebration. It means development has taken place.If countries plan for the shift they can see gains. In Japan, for example, the introduction of universal health coverage meant more treatment for high blood pressure, and therefore fewer strokes, extending worker productivity. If countries consider redesigning pension systems and offering flexible work in retirement, seeing older volunteers as a potential resource, then many more mature members of society can have not just greater life expectancy but also be healthier for longer. Later retirement does not have to mean fewer jobs for the young. More older people working can increase GDP and generate more demand for young workers. The funding battles over international family planning are ongoing. US Congress rejected the 2018 budget. The debates will continue in 2019.Family planning organisations are learning that to survive political shifts and budget cuts, they need to ersify their sources of funding. This means seeing family planning as not just a public health concern but also about development and a clear return on investment. Where women have control over their own fertility, there are gains well beyond their own families.Population.io: the world population project by World Data LabFamily Planning 2020 (FP2020): a global partnership that supports the rights of women and girls to decide whether, when, and how many children they want to have.Population matters: on working towards a sustainable future.IUCN red list: on threatened species.She decides: a global movement to promote, provide and protect the fundamental rights of woman and girls.Kaiser Family Foundation: on global health policy, especially their research on the impact of the “global gag rule”.The Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a7a658b89ae5e48109f347af944e49e9b8aa119/609_3031_5879_3527/master/5879.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6756f70df7aff26b633c26c00a8cf8a7","title":"nigel slater vegetarian recipes spring vegan asparagus lasagne","story":"Spring green lasagne, a crunchy asparagus salad and a comforting root vegetable stewThis time of year can feel like winter, spring or even early summer.

This month’s collection offers a sample of each, something for a season that can freeze, rain or shine as the mood take it.A new potato will roast to a fudgy texture, like a little ball of gnocchi. Score them deeply, toast-rack style, and they will crisp nicely too. Quick note: parmesan must be made with animal rennet in order to be called parmesan, so, strict vegetarians might like to seek out one of the many substitutes on sale.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Wash the potatoes, place each one flat on a chopping board, then score them deeply with a knife at 0.5cm intervals, taking care not to cut right through to the chopping board. Toss them in the olive oil, making sure it gets between the slices, then place the potatoes in a roasting tin in a single layer. Bake for 45 minutes until they are golden and fudgy. (I like to turn them over halfway through.)Wash the spinach, put the leaves and a thin film of water into a large saucepan, cover tightly with a lid, and place over a moderate heat until they start to relax and turn bright green. Remove, refresh in a colander under cold running water then squeeze the leaves with your hands, pressing out most of the water. Roughly chop the spinach then return to the empty pan, add the cream and grated parmesan, and salt and pepper. Warm gently.Peel and finely slice the garlic. Melt the butter in a shallow pan, add the garlic and cook until golden and lightly crisp. Remove and set aside. Toast the almonds in a dry pan till fragrant and lightly browned.Spoon the sauce onto plates, add the roast potatoes, almonds and crisp garlic. Scatter a few pea shoots over the top if you wish.At first glance, this recipe might seem daunting. Much of it, however, involves little more than the chopping and blanching of vegetables. There is a white sauce to make, a couple of cheeses to grate and slice and the rest is an assembly job. It’s a full hour’s work. The result is a creamy, herb-flecked main course that will generously feed six. Note that parmesan is made with animal rennet. There are many vegetarian substitutes available.

Warm the oil in a shallow pan, add the sliced mushrooms and cook for five minutes or so till soft and golden. Stir the mushrooms, broad beans, chopped tarragon and parsley into the sauce, season generously with salt and pepper.Slice the ricotta thinly. Trickle a little oil in the bottom of the dish. Place two or three of the cabbage and chard leaves in the bottom of the dish, then spoon in a third of the sauce. Cover the surface with three more leaves then some of the sliced ricotta, followed by more sauce, ricotta and leaves until you have used them all, finishing with the leaves. Mix together the chopped chard stalks, grated parmesan and breadcrumbs, scatter over the surface, then trickle with the olive oil. Bake for 25 minutes till the surface is crisp and golden.I pounce on the bunches of cime di rapa, also known as cima di rapa or broccoletti, when they turn up at my greengrocers, knowing that their season is even shorter than asparagus. The small broccoli-like florets and spiky leaves are particularly good raw or lightly steamed in a salad. This time, I tossed them into a spring salad with lightly pickled radishes.I love this salad with its crunchy texture, and hot, peppery, sour and salty notes. The asparagus is lightly pickled alongside the radishes, then tossed with samphire and the mustardy greens. (Use broccoli if the cime di rapa proves elusive, which it probably will.)Serves 4 as light main courseoranges 2lemon juice 100mlsherry vinegar 2 tbspradishes 400gasparagus 300gsamphire 75gcime di rapa a small bunchFinely grate the zest from one of the oranges. Cut the oranges in half, then squeeze the juice into a mixing bowl. Add a half-teaspoon of sea salt flakes, then stir in the lemon juice and sherry vinegar.Trim the radishes, removing their leaves and roots. Wash then cut each radish into four, and drop them into the dressing. Shave the asparagus into long, fine strips with a vegetable peeler then put them into the dressing and toss with the radishes. Set aside for two hours, turning the vegetables over every 20 minutes or so.Put a pot of water on for the cime di rapa or broccoli. Salt the water as it comes to the boil then cook for 4 minutes until it is bright green and crisp. Drain and place on kitchen paper. Trim and wash the samphire then fold into the radishes and asparagus together with the cime di rapa. Pile onto plates and serve.A stew to cosset. Small root vegetables, ones that come in packs rather than sacks, are what you need for this. My suggestion of two teaspoons of mustard will leave the seasoning on the mild side. Stir in as much as you like. The dumplings are the real point of it all, especially the undersides, where the oaty pillows soak up the thyme and mustard sauce.For the dumplingsplain flour 70gfine oatmeal 70gbutter 80gbaking powder 1 tspparsley 4 tbsp, choppedthyme leaves 1 tbsp, choppedwater 6-8 tbspPeel the shallots and halve them lengthways. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, add the shallots and let them soften and colour to a pale gold, turning them over from time to time. Put the stock in a saucepan and warm over a moderate heat.Trim the root vegetables, peeling where necessary, then add them to the pan, letting them cook for 5-6 minutes and allowing them to colour lightly. Scatter the flour over the vegetables, and continue cooking for a couple of minutes, then pour in the cider and then the stock.Stir in the grain mustard and the leaves from the thyme sprigs, season thoughtfully with salt and black pepper and continue to simmer, partially covered with a lid, for 20-25 minutes, adding a little more stock or cider as necessary, until you have a sauce of medium thickness.To make the dumplings, put the flour and oatmeal in the bowl of a food processor, add the butter, a half-teaspoon of salt and the baking powder then process to fine crumbs. If you wish, you could rub the butter into the flour by hand. Add the parsley and thyme leaves. Introduce enough of the water to produce a soft but rollable dough. Shape into 8 balls, rolling them in lightly floured hands.Lower the dumplings into the stew, cover tightly with a lid and leave to bubble away for 15 minutes or until the dumplings are cooked. Ladle into bowls and serve.When purple sprouting is in fine fettle, with firm stems and perfect, tight heads, I am happy to give it as much respect as asparagus. That is, served as a course by itself, the deep green spears laid out on a white plate for all to admire. We need something in which to dip them, melted butter spiked with lemon perhaps, or a hollandaise sauce into which you have a grated a little grated orange zest.

Finely slice the fresh chilli and add it to the dip together with enough of the water to make a sauce liquid enough to trickle over the shoots of broccoli. Drain the sprouting broccoli, lay the shoots on a serving dish and pour the satay sauce into a small dish or jug.

Each symphony was prefaced by a shorter work: the Tenth by Michael Tippett’s The Rose Lake the Ninth by the premiere of Helen Grime’s Woven Space, the opening movement of which, Fanfares, had already been heard at Rattle’s first concert as the LSO’s music director last September.Woven Space takes its inspiration and title from a site-specific sculpture by Laura Ellen Bacon, woven from willow twigs and installed in Chatsworth Garden in Derbyshire from 2010 to 2015. Grime echoes Bacon’s work by weaving sonic fragments and melodic shapes into tapestries of sound that coalesce, disperse and reform as the textures alternately thicken, lighten and glare through the score’s three movements. The outer sections have a brittle quality that is in danger of turning insubstantial, though the central slow movement-cum-scherzo, with its slowly shifting string writing, carries deeper emotional resonance. With a Mahler-sized orchestra at her disposal, Grime’s scoring is at times extravagant, and marked by a fondness for tintinnabulatory effects supplied by an array of tuned percussion. It arouses mixed feelings, but Rattle conducted it with considerable energy and drive, and the playing was dexterous, elegant and crystal clear.Woven Space, in many respects, stood apart from the three remaining works, all of which were written towards the end of their respective composers’ lives and confront mortality. Mahler’s Ninth, written after a diagnosis of what proved to be a fatal heart condition, is usually seen as a self-conscious farewell to to life, but in Rattle’s performance the leave-taking was as much angry as resigned. A jolting intensity characterised the shifting moods of the first movement, and the Ländler and Rondo-Burleske were all bitter irony and wit. The LSO sounded glorious in the finale, as its moments of noble assertion gave way to the uneasy calm of despairing acceptance.The second concert was the more remarkable of the two, partly because it fulfilled Rattle’s longstanding ambition to reintroduce The Rose Lake into the repertory of the LSO, who gave the world premiere in 1995. Tippett’s “song without words for orchestra”, completed in 1993 when he was 88, is quite simply astonishing. It is the work of a man contentedly aware of the beauty of the natural world even as the end approaches. Inspired by a trip to Lake Retba in Senegal in 1990, it depicts the sunlight turning the lake’s waters pink, in music at once complex and extraordinarily serene. The performance was well-nigh faultless, with Rattle and the LSO wonderfully alert to Tippett’s exquisite scoring throughout.Rattle likens The Rose Lake’s spiritual calm to the final pages of Mahler’s Tenth, which strive for and attain genuine peace after the terrible turmoil that precedes it. It is in part thanks to his advocacy that Cooke’s performing version has entered the symphonic repertory, and his interpretation remains outstanding. Tautly controlled, it traverses a tremendous emotional arc from despair to transcendence, while remaining aware of the innovations in harmony and structure that would have pointed new ways forward for Mahler had he lived. You can hear the performance, together with The Rose Lake, on the LSO’s YouTube channel until July. •There will be a repeat performance of Woven Space and Mahler’s Ninth Symphony at the Barbican, London, on 26 April.

Fucking travesty.”It’s clearly meant as a joke, but there’s a certain edge to it. The last six months have been a curious period in Gallagher’s career. He released Who Built the Moon?, by some considerable distance the most interesting album he’s made since the mid-90s, and the sort of record he’s been threatening to make ever since Oasis split up. A collaboration with dance producer, DJ and soundtrack composer David Holmes, it pushed Gallagher out of his comfort zone of mid-tempo anthems and Beatles references into more colourful and spacier territory: it touches on ambient electronica, New Order’s shimmering dance-rock hybrid, easy listening, and the sonically super-saturated glam of Roy Wood’s Wizzard. For his trouble, he’s been bested commercially by his brother’s debut solo album As You Were, on which pop songwriters-for-hire were drafted into the aforementioned comfort zone: mid-tempo anthems and Beatles references abound. Perhaps the problem is that Noel should have made Who Built the Moon? 20 years ago. If you spend decades dealing in more of the same, that’s what people come to expect of you – they’re bound to react coolly when you suddenly start breaking out the trombone and the French spoken-word interludes from Charlotte Marionneau (formerly of My Bloody Valentine-affiliated experimentalists Le Volume Courbe), who’s also spotted at one juncture using a pair of scissors as percussion. Still, better late than never, and there’s something pleasingly bullish both about the sound of High Flying Birds – simultaneously expansive and powerful, not least on the brass-assisted Keep on Reaching, which feels like the work of a band rather than backing musicians – and about the show’s implicit suggestion that his audience can very much like his new direction or lump it. While his brother comes onstage to Oasis’ old intro music and immediately starts clobbering them with the contents of Definitely Maybe, Gallagher Sr’s appearance is preceded by a lengthy passage of electronic drone, his set opens with the Screamadelica-ish near-instrumental Fort Knox and proceeds through four songs in a row from Who Built the Moon? Wonderwall and Don’t Look Back in Anger aside, it steps lightly around Oasis’ big hits, concentrating instead on previous moments from Gallagher’s solo oeuvre when he pushed more gently against his self-imposed boundaries: the sax-heavy Riverman, the house-influenced AKA… What a Life! Occasionally, when he does dip into the Oasis catalogue, it acts as an intriguing study in contrasts. Half the World Away is still fantastic, but a trudge through Little By Little serves to remind you of what you’re not missing. It goes down a storm, but it feels leaden next to She Taught Me How to Fly’s breezy sparkle or the propulsive honk of Holy Mountain. There’s the sense of a man slogging away trying to recapture the inspiration that propelled Oasis to the top in the first place, versus the sound of man who seems genuinely inspired once more, powered by something other than nostalgia for Oasis’ mid-90s moment in the sun.

But the political focus can easily obscure rather than illuminate more fundamental issues at stake.This is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over Europe. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.What does it matter?Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations, security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and Ireland would lead to delays which will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as carmaking could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised. Could the UK stay in a customs union?Britain will necessarily leave the existing EU customs union as a direct legal consequence of Brexit, but it could strike a new customs union deal that would replicate many of the advantages. Much like the deal Turkey has negotiated, this would, however, limit the freedom Britain would have to negotiate other trade deals independently of the EU. A future UK government could, in theory, erge from the common external tariff, but foreign importers would know that they could always fall back on EU ports of entry to access our market. At best, therefore, it would require close collaboration between the EU and UK when negotiating third-party trade deals. At worst, Britain would lose any new negotiating clout.What does the government propose instead?Whitehall civil servants have outlined two alternatives to preserve the freedom of life outside a customs union while limiting the disruption from leaving. The first, called “a highly streamlined customs arrangement”, relies on technology and goodwill to limit the impact of new checks. A “trusted trader” scheme and exemptions for small firms in Northern Ireland are intended to put the onus on European business to police itself but would do little to help with other international trade. The second proposal, a “new customs partnership with the EU”, is more ambitious and would see the UK continue to act as if it were in a customs union when dealing with imports from elsewhere. If they are bound for EU markets, the appropriate tariffs would be collected and passed on.What’s the problem?The snag with both of Theresa May’s plans is that no one else believes they are workable. The Irish government and UK business leaders fear that the “customs arrangement” could never be streamlined enough to make a difference. A full-blown “customs partnership” is viewed with even more scepticism in Brussels, where EU officials and MEPs are united in describing it as “magical thinking”. Now even some Brexit-supporting Tories have turned on the plan, fearing it is a “con trick” that could still end up shackling the UK to European rules.Is there a plan B?Without a convincing proposal for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, the UK risks seeing wider Brexit talks grind to a halt and giving business even more to fret about. Instead, the only other option would be to accept proposals by the Labour party and the CBI for the UK to enter into a limited customs union deal like Turkey. This would infuriate Brexiters like the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who might resign in protest. For now, Downing Street has been forced to quash rumours it is willing to take this risk and is ploughing ahead with plan A.When does it all come to a head?Since a vote in the House of Lords supporting a customs union option last week, opposition has been growing in Westminster. MPs are due to debate the issue again on Thursday, and will probably have a chance to vote on their own amendment after local government elections in May. A key cabinet sub-committee is due to discuss how to handle the potential rebellion on Wednesday amid rumours it could become an issue of confidence in the whole government. Either way, with the EU demanding answers to the Irish question by the time of its next summit in June and preparatory legislation backing up in Westminster, the time for kicking the can down the road is fast running out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b598977e875269ff1d96955a6be2f8763d30a949/0_419_6068_3641/master/6068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7157d6d6311317cb7150090a1f084c5","title":"dan jarvis labour sheffield city region mayor election","story":"Labour candidate seeks to overcome voter apathy toward city region vote with pledge to work for wider Yorkshire dealOn a grey weekday morning in Scawsby, Doncaster, the Labour MP Dan Jarvis is knocking on doors to garner support for his bid to be the first mayor for the Sheffield city region – a role that comes with no agreed powers, no agreed budget and no agreed salary. “Apart from that, what’s not to like about it?” he jokes.The government’s decision to push ahead with the election on 3 May, despite south Yorkshire’s local authorities – Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster – failing to agree a devolution settlement, has been criticised as strange and undemocratic.Barnsley and Doncaster pulled out of an initial deal agreed in 2015 last September, following disputes over the route HS2 would take through the region. The two authorities are now among 18 of 20 Yorkshire councils to back proposals for a devolution deal for the whole historic county area, while the government has insisted that the Sheffield city region mayoral election will take place as it was legislated to do so by parliament.The role of Sheffield city region mayor is, therefore, less about wielding power and more about trying to obtain some. “If I’m elected mayor then the very first thing that I will do on my first day is sit down with the four leaders and work out precisely how we are going to reach an agreement that satisfies all of the constituent parts of south Yorkshire,” says the MP for Barnsley Central. “We need an agreement that enables us to start drawing down on the maximum amount of power and the maximum amount of money.” As far as Jarvis is concerned, the Sheffield devolution deal is an interim step. He is one of an increasing number of politicians to have been converted by arguments for a Yorkshire-wide devolution deal and his eventual goal is to see the Sheffield city region join a settlement for the whole county, something Jeremy Corbyn endorsed last week.In what has been dubbed the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire, Jarvis’s win seems assured. All of the county’s 15 MPs are Labour, save for Jared O’Mara in Sheffield Hallam, who was suspended from the party following complaints about homophobic and sexist comments. Jarvis’s main opposition in the mayoral race is split, with pockets of strong Green and Liberal Democrat support in parts of Sheffield and some Tory support in Barnsley and Doncaster.He has six opponents, including candidates for the Yorkshire party, South Yorkshire Save Our NHS and the English Democrats. The Conservative candidate, Ian Geoffrey Walker, a local businessman, stood against Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam in the 2015 and 2017 general elections. The Lib Dem candidate, Hannah Ruth Kitching, runs a manufacturing business and is also standing to be a councillor in Barnsley. The Green party candidate is Robert Murphy, a heating engineer and councillor in Sheffield.Out canvassing with Jarvis is Kevin Rodgers, a Labour councillor in Doncaster. He says he would be astonished if Jarvis did not win, but adds: “Thinking back to 2009 in Doncaster, at the height of the expenses scandal, we got a real protest vote and we got an English Democrat mayor.” (Peter Davies served a four-year term in the role, resigning from his party in early 2013, citing a big influx of new members from the British National party.) “So, never say never,” Rodgers says. Unlike Sheffield and Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster are not holding council elections in May, meaning turnout in the towns could be low. A prominent campaign against tree-felling taking place in Sheffield could result in its Labour council losing some seats in the city’s comparatively affluent south-west, but it is not an issue Jarvis thinks will affect the mayoral race. He acknowledges voices on either side of the argument, but welcomes the council’s decision to pause the felling.Many people opening their doors to Labour activists in Doncaster seem unaware of the upcoming mayoral election. Rebecca Chambers, 20, is coming out of her newly built council house on her way to start her first day in a beauty therapist job, when she runs into the canvassers. “I’d vote if I understood it,” she says. Asked whether she identifies as being from the Sheffield city region, she says no. “Donny first, then Yorkshire.” Even if the four south Yorkshire councils reach a devolution agreement, the new mayor is unlikely to be rolling in cash. The offer on the table includes just £30m a year over 30 years. Jarvis, however, argues that the mayor’s power goes beyond that given to them by central government. “The greatest power that any mayor has is the power to bring people together,” he says. Jarvis is running on a Labour and Co-operative ticket and boasts that his manifesto has “co-op principles hardwired through it”, with plans to help set up more mutuals, cooperatives and community interest companies in south Yorkshire. “I think I’m possibly the only person who was simultaneously in the parachute regiment and the Co-op party,” he says. “And although there are many differences between those organisations, there is one very strong principle that underpins both and that is the need and importance of working alongside other people. At a point when resource is scarce, we have to think even more carefully about how we pool our resources.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a488916d9683ebf7c9c095cde826d6f4e251c64/180_120_2356_1414/master/2356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1f2939be610d6e4f54a770aab205755","title":"downing street rules out u turn on customs union pledge","story":"UK will leave single market and customs union, No 10 maintains, as MPs prepare for key debateDowning Street has insisted it will not back down on leaving the customs union, as pro-Brexit MPs signalled their resolve over the issue ahead of a key week for the future of the UK’s relations with Europe.Peers voted last week in favour of an amendment in favour of staying in the customs union but No 10 rejected the idea of any backsliding. “The position remains very clear: we don’t think staying in a customs union is the right thing to do and it isn’t government policy to do so,” a Downing Street source said.Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, reiterated the point on BBC1’s Breakfast on Monday. “Theresa May’s position on this has been very, very clear,” he said. “She has said that we are not going to be part of the customs union or any customs union. That position hasn’t changed and Downing Street have been clear about that this morning.”Government hopes of avoiding a hard border in Ireland either through technological innovation or regulatory alignment have been set back after they were rejected during preliminary negotiations in Brussels.That has led to speculation that May was preparing to concede on a customs union, which has been a red line since the prime minister’s conference speech in October 2016.John Redwood, the strongly pro-leave Conservative backbencher, said on Monday he did not feel that No 10’s reiteration of the plan to leave any form of customs union had been necessary.“I don’t think I needed reassuring,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I’ve heard many times the prime minister say that it is our policy to leave the single market and customs union.“More importantly, on a three-line whip, we have twice now had formal, important votes in the House of Commons on this, and the House of Commons voted on both occasions by a big margin that we should leave the single market and the customs union.”Asked if the prime minister might shift her policy, Redwood said: “Theresa May won’t change her mind, I assume, because she’s been crystal clear on this throughout, and the Conservative manifesto was quite clear on this, and we need to stick to our word.”The BBC later reported that No 10 could even decree that any vote on staying in the customs union via amendments tabled by Tory remainers would be seen as an issue of confidence in the government. However, a Downing Street source dismissed this.Kenneth Clarke, who has supported one of these amendments, told Today the issue had “suddenly become panic of the day among the apparatchiks in Downing Street”.He said: “Over the weekend I read briefings from Downing Street, allegedly, and others informed about what was going on, that they were going to move on the whole question of the customs arrangements. Today it’s all frightfully important, a matter of confidence, whatever that means.”Clarke said such an important matter must be left to parliament to decide, saying: “Nobody wants to just erect new barriers to trade between ourselves and Europe, with thousands of customs officers, lorry parks and so on. I think in the end, parliament has got to decide what is in the national interest. This is a big subject.”Reports over the weekend suggested a “wargaming” exercise into the consequences of a concession showed that not even leading Brexiters such as Michael Gove, the environment secretary, or Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, would resign.But a source close to Gove reiterated his opposition, saying: “Michael believes respecting the referendum result means taking back control of trade policy. He fully supports the prime minister’s position that this means leaving the customs union.”Although the dropping of other pledges in negotiations have been reluctantly accepted, such as the promise to reclaim control over fishing quotas from March 2019, accepting continued membership of a customs union would be of a different and much larger scale.Any customs union makes it effectively impossible to negotiate free trade deals with other countries – one of the government’s key ambitions and a central justification for leaving the EU. A meaningful vote on remaining in the customs union is likely in the next few months. At least 10 Conservative backbenchers have signed an amendment to the trade and customs bill supporting continued membership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36bd24e635702135cb8c7710ba63667c6ea8de74/0_193_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de0f6bdb31e4fed37ff618f72731c321","title":"labour promises four more bank holidays if it wins general election","story":"Jeremy Corbyn says workers deserve more time off after years of ‘damaging Tory austerity’ Labour will introduce new bank holidays to mark the patron saints of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland if it wins the next general election, Jeremy Corbyn is to announce.The party leader will tell a union conference on Monday, which is St George’s Day, that Britain’s workers deserve a day off after eight years of “damaging Tory austerity”.Labour will ask for the support of the devolved governments so that the same four holidays can be enjoyed across the United Kingdom.Under Labour’s proposals, UK-wide public holidays would be held on St David’s Day (1 March), St Patrick’s Day (17 March), St George’s Day (23 April) and St Andrew’s Day (30 November).With eight public holidays, the UK has the fewest of any G20 or EU country, Corbyn will tell the annual conference of the Communication Workers Union in Bournemouth.He will say: “If we win the next election, St George’s Day will become a national holiday for Britain’s workers. It will be a day where we can all show our pride and celebrate our country’s tradition of fairness, inclusivity and social justice.“Eight years of Tory austerity, which Labour will bring to an end, have had a disastrous effect on our vital public services and workers have paid a heavy price in the cost of living and their working lives.

With many young people eschewing alcohol, the beginning of the end of booze Britain is in sightA cool glass of sauvignon canalside in the summer. A soothing beer by a pub fire as the leaves turn red. Mulled wine with a Christmas mince pie. Alcohol is shot through British life like, well, shots on a night out. But recent trends suggest that might be changing. Could the British love of booze be drying up as surely as our passion for\u0026nbspcigarettes?The result was immediate: fag breaks at work were suddenly more frowned upon the huddle of people outside the pub failing to light a cigarette in the driving rain came to seem pitiful. All the incremental changes – the health warnings, legislation, the images of diseased lungs on fag packets, the association with impotence – led to a genuine cultural shift. If you wanted to keep smoking, you had to be really committed (addicted, maybe?). Social and fairweather smokers dropped away.Could the same trend be under way with our attitude to alcohol? Some experts believe so. It will be a huge shift, because drinking in the UK has a spirited history, stretching back thousands of years – jugs for fermenting alcohol go back to the stone age, past Hogarth’s Beer Street and Gin Lane in the 1700s through to the peak modern drinking period of the 90s and early 00s. This was the Britpop era: a wasted Jarvis Cocker mooning at Michael Jackson at the Brit awards in 1996 and the hideous proliferation of garish alcopops with brand names with no vowels. That period also saw\u0026nbspa breakdown in the social taboos around women’s drinking that led to\u0026nbspan explosion of alcohol being marketed to them. Witness the birth\u0026nbspof the ladette and girlfriends drinking boyfriends under the table. Witness a massive overall rise in consumption.As a society, we have always thought of drinking as a bit naughty. The language we use is telling. A “cheeky pint” after work a “swift half” “OK, but just one glass of merlot”. Everyone has feigned resistance at one time or another – but we don’t try very hard. And in recent decades, anyone who didn’t want to drink was considered an anomaly. You driving? You sick? You on antibiotics? You pregnant? You, you know … (whisper it) in recovery? An answer of none of the above would elicit raised eyebrows, a puzzled expression or, more likely, mirth. Possibly even anger or dislike. In years past, people who have chosen sobriety, or rarely had a drink, have been subject to intense peer pressure. Nondrinkers became isolated – not out of preference, but because British social life has been entirely organised around alcohol. Booze sat at the head of the table at dinner parties, dominated the dancefloor and landed deals at lunch meetings.But over the past decade, that culture has shifted. It has certainly been difficult to avoid the news that alcohol isn’t good for you. The most recent reminder came last week, care of a Lancet paper, reporting that every glass of wine or pint of beer over the daily recommended limit will cut half an hour from the expected life of a 40-year-old. And that recommended upper safe limit is lower than you might expect. The paper suggested five 175ml glasses of\u0026nbspwine or five pints a week – about 12.5 units in total. Overdo it, and you\u0026nbspare at greater risk of stroke, fatal\u0026nbspaneurysm, heart failure and early death.Then there’s the cancer risk. There was consternation in 2016 when Prof Dame Sally Davies, the government’s chief medical officer, told MPs just one glass of wine could increase the risk of breast cancer. This came just a few weeks after the recommended upper safe limit for men was revised down from 21 to 14 units a week, the same as for women.The quality newspapers interview health experts and sociologists about the problems with alcohol the popular press shames indulgent punters (usually northern, often women) on dark high streets, hitting the chip shops at 3am. That picture of the woman lying on her back on a bench, sozzled, gets wheeled out. And there have been all sorts of schemes and campaigns designed to curb our enthusiasm for drinking. There’s the Department of Transport’s road-safety Think! campaign, for instance, much of which has focused on drink driving. In 2012, Andrew Lansley and the Department for Health rolled out the Change4Life campaign, while Challenge 25, introduced in 2005 by the British Beer and Pub Association, encourages people who may look under 25 to carry ID when attempting to purchase alcohol, and encourages retailers to ask for it. This has made it harder for groups of teenagers to bulk buy supermarket-own tinnies. (Attempting to enter licensed premises to buy alcohol using a fake ID is a criminal offence, carrying a maximum £5,000 fine and up to 10 years imprisonment.)All of this legislation, campaigning and awareness raising has had an impact, just as they did on tobacco consumption. In particular, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) and the later Generation Z (those born after 1996), are surprisingly sober.“Alcohol is a strange concept,” says Ben Gartside, 19, a politics student at Hull University who is originally from Manchester. “Here’s a liquid you can drink and it can lead to you not remembering the night before and making bad decisions.” Ben is typical of many young people I speak to, in that he prefers to spend his money on food and travel rather than pub sessions.Another young person I speak to says his family are heavy drinkers and he wanted to avoid falling into that pattern. In a broader sense, says Dr James Nicholls, director of research and policy development at Alcohol Research UK, this is quite common among young people they are rebelling against older generations’ chosen methods of rebellion. According to a 2017 ONS study, more than a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds are teetotal, a four-fold increase on the rest of the population, with just one in 10 seeing drinking as “cool”. Nicholls says that drinking among young people has been declining for a decade.The millennials and Gen Zers I spoke to cited various reasons for their sobriety one of the most recurrent was that between university tuition fees, the axing of maintenance grants and the sixth form EMA grant, and the perilously high cost of housing, they are pretty much broke. But they also have concerns for their mental and physical health. Lauren Clapp, 23, says booze made her chronic fatigue syndrome worse. There is also a case to be made that young people, who suffer disproportionately with mental health issues (a third of 16- to 24-year-olds have experienced a mental health issue in the past 12 months, according to one survey), are more open to talk and seek support, relying less on substances as an emotional crutch.But not everyone is laying off, even with the growing awareness of alcohol’s negative side effects. There are plenty of people who hold out for those articles proposing that red wine is good for blood pressure and cling to the glamorous champagne habits of celebrities. Drinking among the middle-aged middle classes has not declined. In fact, while some of them might feel smug to have left their binge-drinking pasts behind, their regular daily consumption might be doing more damage to their bodies, not less. In 2015, Age Concern found that higher-income groups are “endangering” their health with their drinking habits. Figures show that mortality rates due to alcohol, among people aged 75 and over, have risen to their highest level since\u0026nbsprecords began in 1991.In fact, alcohol consumption is rising among the over-50s. This is a looming crisis for the NHS, health experts warn, as alcohol contributes to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, as well as a litany of cancers.But the fact is that those who are currently middle-aged may prove to\u0026nbspbe the last generation who of boozehounds. Just as young people are changing the worlds\u0026nbspof politics, technology and environmentalism, it is possible that this shift in the British attitude to alcohol will last the course. And further legislation and awareness is planned for the future. Next month, minimum alcohol unit pricing comes into force in Scotland.We are not alone in this cultural shift. While many countries, particularly our European cousins, have long had a mature attitude to drinking, Nicholls says that declining interest in alcohol, especially among\u0026nbspyoung people, is a worldwide trend. This is true even of countries that used to be big on the booze, such as Russia.We don’t know for sure, of course, that Britain will become a dry land in\u0026nbspyears to come – alcohol trends peak and trough, but it has never looked more likely than it does now. Drinks on me, then – it’s going to be a\u0026nbspcheap round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86ef60cf5bd52c21da806ab58c07680f0b23f304/6_167_3304_1983/master/3304.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57457eceff67ed447199c6148fbf708e","title":"leinster champions cup ready take seat european ruby top table","story":"It will take a monumental effort in the final from Racing 92 to deny Leinster victory in a Champions Cup that feels seminal, if certainly not vintageIt has not been a vintage Champions Cup by any stretch but after a weekend of deep intensity, if little in the way of edge‑of‑the‑seat excitement, it is hard to escape the sense it is a seminal one. Since Leinster last sat at the head of the European table, Toulon and Saracens have both taken their turns but they are marching back with a blend of power and precision that suggests they will take some shifting.It will require an almighty effort from Racing 92 to deny them in Bilbao next month and while the French side had too much in their armoury for a Munster team so uncharacteristically rattled, Leinster’s ability to sustain their excellence for 79 minutes against the Scarlets understandably installs them as favourites. The Scarlets’ scythe was simply no match for Leinster’s sledgehammer and had Racing not palpably taken the foot off the pedal in the second half on Sunday the scoreline would have been every bit as one-sided.It was not – and credit Munster’s second-half showing for that – but it can be said with some certainty that both matches were over by half-time. So no, not a vintage tournament, regardless of how much English involvement there was in the latter stages.Undoubtedly there have been pockets of excitement, but perhaps we were a little too easily seduced by the swashbuckling Scarlets or La Rochelle’s razzle dazzle. There are not many matches that will linger long in the memory and if the semi-finals told us anything it is that there is no substitute for the kind of physicality and accuracy served up by both Leinster and, for the first half at least, Racing.Leinster were imperious but, as with Racing, they could afford to be only because of the quick ball provided to them by their bulldozing forwards. The Scarlets selected a pair of breakdown experts in their back-row in James Davies and John Barclay but neither had a sniff with Cian Healy, James Ryan or Scott Fardy smashing every ruck or blasting over the gain-line with ball in hand. For Racing, read Yannick Nyanga, who at 34 was perhaps the most impressive performer across the weekend. Ably assisted by both props – Eddy Ben Arous and Cedate Gomes Sa – and the inidual brilliance of Teddy Thomas, Racing bullied a Munster side that had been developing a reputation for doing similar themselves.Racing have not quite crept up on the rails to reach the final – a second in three seasons – but they have spent less time in the spotlight, benefiting from an emphasis on the narrative of Irish dominance this season. Clermont may be enduring a torrid time but not many teams emerge from a knockout match at the Stade Marcel-Michelin victorious so perhaps we ought to have paid more attention to Racing’s quarter-final victory. For they have recast themselves as European heavyweights less reliant on their overseas stars. Rather, it is less heralded players – teak-tough forwards such as Bernard Le Roux, so influential at the breakdown, Wenceslas Lauret and, of course, Nyanga – who laid the platform on Sunday, all the while marshalled by the wonderful Maxime Machenaud.They, at least, may be equipped to handle Leinster’s power. Saracens were able to for 45 minutes or so before Leinster pressed the accelerator to the floor but anyone who makes Munster look so ordinary will be difficult opponents. It is hard to recall Conor Murray having such a poor afternoon and it will come as no consolation that his international halfback partner, Johnny Sexton, did not miss a beat against the Scarlets.Sexton was the star turn for Leinster, who like Saracens and Toulon before them, give off a certain air of invincibility. Before this season, the last time Ireland won the Six Nations grand slam was 2009 and a couple of months later Leinster clinched their first European title. Racing are worthy finalists but only a brave gambler would bet against a repeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93c69a907de00fed8cbe9d0fa1289391a4d70f86/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bddcc916b7b1dc80a5ed3d9d08a50646","title":"talking horses dans dream could represent spinal charity in guineas","story":"Filly could provide a “life-changing” moment for charity if connections decide to supplement her for NewmarketIt’s too early to be making actual predictions for the 1,000 Guineas but I know for sure which horse I’ll be cheering for, having been told by the owner-breeder that all prize money won by Dan’s Dream goes to a spinal injury research charity. Dan’s Dream won a notable trial race in the Fred Darling at Newbury on Saturday and the question now is whether she should be supplemented for the Newmarket Classic a week on Saturday, at a cost of £30,000.\u0026nbspThis filly was bred and is still owned by Steven Smith of Hunscote Stud in Warwickshire. Smith told us at Newbury that he broke his back some years earlier. He didn’t mention how it happened but I have since read reports of how he had to jump from a window to evade armed burglars while on holiday.\u0026nbspSince then, Smith has become a trustee of the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and this filly is evidently his latest contribution to the cause. While his stud still owns her, her prize money will go to the NSIF. As Smith put it: “If she won the Guineas, that is life-changing for the charity.” First prize for the race is over a quarter of a million.\u0026nbspDan’s Dream, a 20-1 shot for the Guineas, is named after the man whose injury caused the creation of NSIF, Dan Nicholls, who broke his neck while swimming on Bondi Beach at the age of 18. “Dan’s dream is to walk again,” Smith explained.“He probably hasn’t improved very much in the last five or six years. But the charity supports ground-breaking stem cell research, which, for him and even me, could change our lives.” NSIF has helped fund research carried out at University College London.\u0026nbspIt could be said that the 1,000 Guineas owes something to the victims of spinal injury. I was there eight years ago when Noel Martin, rendered quadriplegic by a racist assault some years before, saw his Jacqueline Quest disqualified from first place. Viewed purely in terms of what happened on the track, it was definitely the right decision to disqualify, but it was heartbreaking at the same time and Martin evidently had not realised he was going to lose the race until it was announced.Turning to today’s action, I see the market doesn’t fancy Marracudja (2.30) and that is understandable, as he has done his share of underperforming. But he won last time when Bryony Frost rode for the first time and she is back aboard today at Newton Abbot, where the horse is one from one.\u0026nbspToday involves a step up in distance to two and a half miles and Marracudja has not always looked a strong candidate for going further. But he kept going at Musselburgh last time and he’s by Martaline, a stallion who has not exactly made his name with two-milers, producing Dynaste, Agrapart, Terrefort and Ucello Conti among other slow horses.\u0026nbspHe still looks very fairly handicapped on the pick of his form and I’ll take 4-1 against this handful of beatable rivals, even if he did open at 15-8.\u0026nbspThe in-form James Ewart sends Sky Full Of Stars (2.20) to Hexham, hoping he can go one better than at Newcastle last time. He was a close second that day, with the rest beaten 21 lengths, and 3-1 is fair about him managing a similar effort against an unthreatening field here.\u0026nbspTips by John O\u0027Hara."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcee9baf68c3c0a7d07382b391a0d6356009627/0_114_4552_2731/master/4552.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0bc5b5e9ccce7d62ab9603e85033e7b","title":"county cricket yorkshire v notts surrey v hampshire and more live","story":"All the action from around the grounds as this round of County Championship fixtures reach their final dayWhile Andy Bull watches Surrey try to wrap up their win over Hampshire at the Oval, needing two more wickets, it is a similar story at Derby where Middlesex are 2057 chasing 442 with Toby Roland-Jones and James Harris at the crease. Gloucestershire look like making Glamorgan bat again at Bristol - 12 behind with three wickets left, while that early handshake is still on the cards at Grace Road, where Sussex are 1273, leading by 143.If Ben Coad keeps taking wickets at this rate, speculation around an England Test call-up will inevitably reach a crescendo. The 24-year-old Yorkshire seamer finished with six wickets in the second innings and 10130 in the match as the White Rose beat Notts by 164 runs, taking 21 points. Coad has now taken 65 wickets in 16 first-class matches, including 50 in the Championship last season: “There’s people saying stuff about that, but I’m just concentrating on Yorkshire,” he said. “I just want to be the best I can be here. If that comes, great.”Elsewhere, in Division Two, Middlesex are 1667 at Derby and still on course for a defeat. They lost John Simpson on the stroke of lunch, while Gloucestershire look set for a home defeat to Glamorgan, although the visitors may have to bat again. Gloucester are 51 runs with three wickets left. Leicestershire and Sussex are heading for an early handshake and a draw at Grace Road.After last week’s little heatwave it’s a bit chilly here at The Oval, but the way play’s shaping we might not be outdoors long enough to get cold. Sam Northeast, not out overnight, is still in. He’s just brought up his 50, two sweet cover drives in succession off Sam Curran the best of his batting this morning. But a couple of wickets have fallen at the other end. Rilee Roussow made it through most of the first hour, but fell lbw to Surrey’s young off-spinner Amar Virdi and Liam Dawson hardly settled before he was bowled by Jade Dernbach. Viddi’s a lovely bowler to watch, with an easy, graceful action and lots of puppyish enthusiasm. So Hampshire are 1766, some 296 behind. Kyle Abbott’s in now, the first man in a long Hampshire tail. He doesn’t have the air of a man who is going to bat through the day. Yorkshire have won by 164 runs. Ben Coad struck twice in the over – he had just switched ends to the Kirkstall Lane End – to remove Jake Ball bowled and Harry Gurney caught at second slip, finishing with six wickets in the innings and 10 in the match. 21 points for the White Rose county. Jake Ball and Tom Moores are impressively defying Yorkshire and have shared an unbroken 61, with a number of eye-catching straight drives from the pair. They have taken the score to 2338, with left-handed Moores on 36. I had to laugh last night when Dave Bracegirdle from BBC Radio Nottingham spoke to Tom and said ‘If you believe in Roy of the Rovers stuff, you could end up 200 not out tomorrow with a win under your belt’. His reply ‘Who’s he?’. Young ’uns, hey! Steady start to day four for Notts, who have seen off the first four overs of the day through Tom Moores and Jake Ball. Jack Brooks has really got it swinging early doors. 1928 at present. Middlesex have lost an early one at Derby. Olly Rayner has fallen to South Africa quick Duanne Olivier.Good morning. I would imagine we’re in for a pretty short fourth day. Notts will begin on 1818, chasing 403 after crumbling in Sunday night’s evening session to the extent that umpires Michael Gough and Nick Cook even sanctioned the extra half hour.A Yorkshire win would see them gain 21 points to Notts’ three and win their first match of the season at the second attempt (first if you are ignoring the Essex abandonment). Their excellent young seamer Ben Coad is a wicket away from a second-innings five-for.This is one of only two matches still in progress in Division One and five in all around the country. At the Oval, Hampshire are 1164 requiring another 356 to beat Surrey. That isn’t happening, I’m afraid, Hampshire fans.In Division Two, Middlesex are 863, also needing 356 more to beat Derbyshire at the County Ground. A rare home win for Derby in the offing. Gloucestershire are battling to avoid a home innings defeat against Glamorgan. They are 1335 in their second innings and trailing by 157. And finally, it’s been a weird old game at Grace Road, where it looks to have been fairly routine. 400 plays 400 between Sussex and Leicestershire and a draw very much on the cards.PS, it’s certainly worth having a look at Tim Bresnan’s mid-pitch fall during his 68 not out here yesterday ... Graham will be here shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf7dad9b8264ab7aba0f90a02bdb9605e4e0d173/0_333_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebd0f59056ffe82f71c2df746af8ab70","title":"top 10 wild cycle rides uk","story":"A bicycle is the perfect way to explore the countryside. These off-grid routes, from mountainous lung-busters to scenic family rides, explore history as well as wildernessThe Malvern Hills are wilderness in the Midlands, outliers of the Welsh mountains and beloved by artists, writers, poets and composers. The Malverns were composer (and keen cyclist) Edward Elgar’s muse, and the inspiration for 14th-century poet William Langland, whose famous work Piers Plowman includes the words: “On a May morning, on a Malvern hill-topA marvel befell me, as might a fairy tale.”Riding a ridge, hilltop to hilltop, is the special cycling experience the Malvern Hills provide. North to south they stand like a regiment, a stubborn chain of 680-million-year-old rock, Wales to the west and the rolling fields of the Midlands to the east. Bike-accessible bridleways trace almost all of the ridgeline, and there are several car parks along it too. Worcestershire Beacon (435 metres) is the highest point. A toposcope at the summit puts names to places in the view. Ride out and back along the ridge, or along the ridge and back on the quiet(ish) roads on the Malverns’ west side. The eastern flank roads are busier, but Great Malvern is on the east side and is well-stocked with eating places and watering holes.This is one of the wildest cycling experiences anywhere. It’s in a wilderness called the Parph, among some of the oldest geology on the planet. The ride goes from the Kyle of Durness ferry to the surging sea at Cape Wrath, one of only two named Capes in the country (the other being Cape Cornwall). Check ferry times (on capewrathferry.wordpress.com), and the weather, then follow the road from where the ferry drops you for just over 11 miles to the Cape Wrath lighthouse. It sounds simple but the road is rough and hilly, while the scenery is stunning. By 1949 this ride was such a rite of passage for adventurous cyclists that author Rex Coley founded the Cape Wrath Fellowship. All you needed to join was a photograph at the ferry and another at the lighthouse to prove you’d done it.The South Downs, running from Eastbourne to Winchester, is a chain of round-topped green hills, crisscrossed and followed by old trails worn into their underlying chalk, creating an English version of Tuscany’s famous strade bianche. The perfect South Downs wild cycling experience is to ride along one of the low chalk trails and admire the shapely hills, then climb up on to them and follow a hilltop trail back to where you started. Alfriston is a great starting place.While there, check out the winged wheel symbol outside Ye Olde Smugglers Inne on Waterloo Square. Winged wheels were an early rating system devised by the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC), now Cycling UK. Established in 1881, they were awarded to eating places and hotels that CTC officials had inspected and arranged special rates with for their members. Head north from the Smugglers to a crossroads, where the metalled road goes sharp right. Continue straight on the trail. This takes you along the base of the South Downs, through a glorious patchwork of arable fields. Cross some minor roads and trails: turn left on any one of them when ready to climb to the top of the downs. Once there, pick up the chalk trail that runs along the tops and follow it back to Alfriston.Start at Lewis Burn car park in Kielder Forest. Follow the trail next to Lewis Burn to its confluence with Akenshaw Burn. Take the right trail fork, still climbing through the forest to break tree cover at the Bloody Bush Toll. The pillar with old toll prices on it is the Scottish border but Bloody Bush doesn’t refer to battles between the two countries, rather it comes from a time when the border clans regarded themselves as a third country, with its own laws. They were the Border reivers (raiders), and they made a living as mercenaries and cattle thieves. The name Bloody Bush dates from the 15th century, when a Northumbrian clan stole cattle from the Scottish side. The Scottish reivers tracked them down, slaughtered them here and repossessed their cattle in compliance with reiver law. For an extra-wild experience, do this ride at night Kielder is a dark sky park with very little light pollution and clear nights are unforgettable.A jewel of the Lake District, Ennerdale Water fills the lower valley floor, reflecting the forested hillsides and surrounding mountains. There’s lots of wild cycling in the Lake District but this simple route is accessible and gets wilder the higher you go. Start in Bowness Knott car park (not to be confused with Bowness-on-Windermere) and head east. The trail follows the north bank of Ennerdale Water, which isn’t truly a lake because the Liza river flows into its eastern end, becoming the Ehen when it flows out of the west. The spot where the river enters Ennerdale is called Char Dub, named after the Arctic char, a fish that only lives in very cold water. From Char Dub follow the Liza upstream, again on the north side, as far as the Black Sail youth hostel (which sells tea and cake), then retrace the route to Bowness Knott.Knighton, on the English-Welsh border, stands at the heart of a web of interesting and ancient bridleways. Glyndwr’s Way is one mile out of town heading west on the A488. It’s a tiny lane at first but becomes a traillane you can follow for miles. Owain Glyndŵr was the last Welsh-born Prince of Wales. He led a Welsh revolt against English occupation throughout the first decade of the 1400s. It was unsuccessful, and he disappeared. Head north-west up the Teme valley and you soon see signs for Offa’s Dyke. It was built (long before there was an England or a Wales) by King Offa to keep the people of the Kingdom of Powys out of his Mercia. The dyke can be traced from the Dee estuary south to the river Wye. Parts of it are bridleway, while a network of other bridleways cross it.Four miles further along the Teme valley, Offa’s Dyke meets the Jack Mytton Way, which is perfect for a wild cycle in the Shropshire Hills. Mytton was a Shropshire landowner and a thoroughly disreputable character. He’s done well to be remembered with this trail, a pub and the annual Jack Mytton run. Expelled from Westminster and Harrow, Mytton left Cambridge without a degree but having allegedly consumed 2,000 bottles of port. In 1819, he entered parliament, giving everyone who voted for him £10. That, along with his drinking and gambling, bankrupted him and he ended his days in debtor’s prison.Prepared cycleways aren’t everybody’s idea of a challenging ride but they are perfect for families and some, like this one, are pretty wild. It’s part of Route 1 of the National Cycle Network, and built on the old Whitby to Scarborough rail bed. It had cinder rather than stone ballast, so after the line closed in 1965, and the track was removed, it became known as the Cinder Path. Running from North Bay in Scarborough to Hawkser, a village just south of Whitby, the trail is 17½ miles long and plays hide and seek with the sea all the way. Ravenscar summit has the wildest view: the sea is only 500 metres away but 195 metres below. The tearoom in Ravenscar is a great refuelling stop, and Whitby has the best fish and chips in the country but then I’m from Yorkshire so …Breckland is 393 sq m of sandy heathland and forest. It’s one of the driest places in the UK, and there are few hills, which makes for easy riding. The best trails here are called droves, used many years ago to move livestock to and from markets. Their paths are marked on the Ordnance Survey Landranger map (144) with broken long red dashes or larger red dots. Brandon, on the NorfolkSuffolk border is surrounded by droves and it’s easy to plan rides with a map. Look out for the Breckland pine rows, where tall trees stand between open fields to reduce soil erosion. Scots pines thrive in the dry conditions here, and they have open canopies, unlike some other pines, making Breckland woods delightful places to ride.The Tarka Trail wanders all over Devon, but this stretch runs through a lovely range of countryside, from its deepest-Devon start to its seaside destination. From Torrington, the trail is smooth for most of the way, with several cafes – the rail carriage in Bideford is fun. It crosses the Torridge river twice in the first two miles. Stop at the weir under the second bridge and if the season is right you may see salmon leaping up it. The Torridge widens and becomes tidal just before Bideford, becoming open sea at Instow. From here, cyclists can ride right around the Taw estuary, crossing the river in Barnstaple, to complete the ride in sunny, sandy Braunton.

Now an influx of artists, intellectuals and hipsters are making it their playground When ecological disaster hit Bombay Beach, a resort town marooned by a dying lake in California’s desert, the result looked apocalyptic.Birds and fish died. Toxic dust swirled. The air stank. Tourists and most residents fled, leaving a virtual ghost town of abandoned, decaying homes. For decades the only regular visitors were film-makers who came to shoot horror flicks about zombies and Armageddon.Now, Bombay Beach, population 295, is enjoying a rebirth of sorts with an influx of artists, intellectuals and hipsters who have turned it into a bohemian playground.There is an opera house, a gallery, an “Hermitage” museum, a conceptual pavilion and a drive-in movie theatre. Which sounds rather grand, but the desert wind whistles through the cracks and it looks like Mad Max did the decorating.The closest thing to a hotel – a shipping container with plywood floors and walls – is adorned with photographs of the criminally insane.There are also giraffe sculptures, a defunct sensory deprivation tank, a four-dimensional hypercube called a tesseract and a fake particle accelerator made of gold-painted junk. Plus a festival, the Bombay Beach Biennale, with exhibitions, philosophy seminars, ballet and poetry. Sandstorms and scorching sun can make it feel closer to Mars than Venice’s biennale.“People are engaging with the idea of creating this outpost of freedom and creativity. Hopefully it just stays authentic and weird,” Tao Ruspoli, a photographer, musician and film-maker who has led the charge, said last week, giving the  a tour.Ruspoli, 42, started coming in 2007, making the three-hour drive from Los Angeles, and friends followed, intrigued by his declaration that here was the most interesting town in America.Several have bought property – trailers, bungalows and empty lots – as homes, studios and exhibition spaces. “We don’t want it to be a passing thing. We want to leave a mark, though with the knowledge that everything is impermanent. We’re attacked from all directions – vandalism, extreme heat, 50 mph winds,” said Ruspoli, who is also the son of an Italian prince.He considers the corporate razzmatazz of the Coachella festival, 40 miles north, the antithesis of the “Dadaist” experiment unfolding in Bombay Beach, which has little commerce besides two grocery stores and two bars. The nearest gas station is 20 miles away.Even so, an influx of artists who buy property and push up prices may sound ominous to those pushed out of homes by gentrification in formerly run-down parts of Brooklyn, Oakland and Los Angeles. Some activists say artists pave a path for moneyed investors and speculators.Prices are rising in Bombay Beach. Some bungalows which cost a few thousand dollars 15 years ago now fetch tens of thousands of dollars.“They’re buying up all the old stuff, it seems like they’re taking over,” grumbled an 80-year-old customer at the Ski Inn bar, who gave his name only as Wacko. “A lot of the buildings are painted ridiculous colours.” Vandalism and petty theft has hit some exhibits, suggesting there are additional detractors.Still, Wacko appeared to be in a minority. Of a dozen residents interviewed at random, 11 welcomed the bohemians. “The town was dying. They’re bringing in young people, fixing places up,” said Mark Hagedorn, 65. “It’s a shot in the arm,” said Ernest Hawkins, 75. “This place used to rock. Then it went to sleep. Everyone left or got old.” Lisa Trujill, 52, a housepainter, said she wanted more music, more arts. “I love it.”A 2012 award-winning documentary chronicled some of the town’s lost souls. Without wind, from a distance, Bombay Beach looks ravishing. Its sits by the Salton Sea, California’s biggest lake, a 360 sq mile swath of tranquil water ringed by white beaches.Appearances deceive – the lake is dying. It formed in 1905 when the Colorado river breached a canal and poured into this dry desert basin, creating a habitat for hundreds of species of fish and birds. Bombay Beach and a few other resorts sprang up and thrived in the 1950s. Then growing salinity and agricultural pollution killed the fish. Their bones are what makes the beaches white. Hunger and disease ravaged the birds. The lake is receding, leaving winds to whip up toxic, odiferous soil. The smell can travel far, notably in a 2012 event known as “the big burp”.State authorities announced a plan last year to restore some of the lake, the first phase of a long-promised rescue. Skeptics fear it will never happen.The Bombay Beach Biennale – which despite the name has taken place each year – riffs on its environs. The first in 2016 was themed on the “art of decay”. The 2017 festival asked artists to imagine the future that did not happen. This year, held over a weekend in March and aided by a Getty foundation grant, was themed “God’s silence”.Melody Sample, 31, built a “dream house” installation in a ruined bungalow which included a bathtub and a table set for high tea. “The energy here is really fresh. It’s like a forgotten place in a death, rebirth cycle,” she said. This applies to her exhibit: thieves stole the benches and incense and other artifacts, leaving the dream house somewhat forlorn.Stefan Ashkenazy, who owns the Petit Ermitage hotel in West Hollywood, is Bombay Beach’s svengali. He has bought several abandoned lots and brings in artists to transform them.He arrived last week at the wheel of an open-top Mercedes playing Bizet. The appeal was not property but experience, he said. “Of all the things I do this is the most free, the most inspiring.” He wants to turn E street into a cultural hub to host, among other things, film premieres at the drive-in which is populated with vintage, wrecked cars. Wacko, the refusenik, was not impressed. “They wouldn’t allow that in LA. Down here they get away with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8387b806bc420ec7c8042098c2200a018f70901/1019_794_3697_2218/master/3697.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74aa670afed2da1898854f16b5590bc8","title":"eventbrite apologises for footage rights grab","story":"Events website says sorry for user agreement giving it right to use footage from private events for its own purposesA website that allows users to create, promote and sell tickets to events has apologised to users for a clause in its terms of service that allowed it to attend, film and use the footage for its own purposes.Eventbrite hosts more than 2m events a year, ranging from small free gatherings of friends to large paid-for conferences.Buried near the bottom of the website’s 10,000-word merchant agreement was a section titled “Permissions you grant us to film and record your events”. It gave Eventbrite wide-ranging powers to use private events for its own purposes, including in adverts for the site.The terms and conditions also allowed the company to film behind the scenes as an event was being set up or packed away, and required event hosts to obtain, at their own expense, all the “permissions, clearances and licenses” required to allow Eventbrite to do what it wanted, and left the question of whether it had to even credit performers or hosts “in its discretion”.The clause, which affected the British version of the site as well as the American, was added to the merchant agreement at the beginning of April, but it took until Friday for user Barney Dellar to bring the rights grab to wider attention.Eventbrite apologised for the clause on Sunday night, and removed it from its site. A spokeswoman told the : “Earlier this month we made an update to our terms of service and merchant agreement that would allow us the option to work with inidual organisers to secure video and photos at their events for marketing and promotional purposes.“We’ve heard some concerns from our customers and agree that the language of the terms went broader than necessary given our intention of the clause.“We have not recorded any footage at events since this clause was added, and upon further review, have removed it entirely from both our terms of service and merchant agreement. We sincerely apologise for any concern this caused.”Many companies are rushing out large updates to their terms of service in the runup to 25 May, the enforcement date for Europe’s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which strengthens iniduals’ data protection rights. In the last week, Facebook, Tumblr, and Airbnb have all notified users of their new terms of service.The European Union\u0027s new stronger, unified data protection laws, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will come into force on 25 May 2018, after more than six years in the making.GDPR will replace the current patchwork of national data protection laws, give data regulators greater powers to fine, make it easier for companies with a one-stop-shop for operating across the whole of the EU, and create a new pan-European data regulator called the European Data Protection Board.The new laws govern the processing and storage of EU citizens\u0027 data, both that given to and observed by companies about people, whether or not the company has operations in the EU. They state that data protection should be both by design and default in any operation.GDPR will refine and enshrine the right to be forgotten laws as the right to erasure, and give EU citizens the right to data portability, meaning they can take data from one organisation and give it to another. It will also bolster the requirement for explicit and informed consent before data is processed, and ensure that it can be withdrawn at any time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6454fb178ac9a6d7fcb41c80b6eacba7f1925be/393_808_5226_3135/master/5226.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b29e2d29f5e967dda17aad4b8a48a29","title":"how a vampire squid inspired a goldman prize winning marine life champion","story":"European winner of the Goldman environment prize switched from journalism to activism to tackle the destructive practice of deep-sea bottom trawlingIt was a vampire squid that inspired the European winner of this year’s Goldman environmental prize to successfully challenge the devastatingly unsustainable practice of bottom-trawling.More than a decade before Blue Planet, Claire Nouvian was researching this rare creature – a living fossil that is found 4,000m below the surface of Monterey Bay – for a French television company, when she first realised the extraordinary variety of life and colour on the deep ocean floor.The joy of that discovery was quickly followed by horror when she realised how quickly this landscape – formed over centuries – was being turned into a desert as a result of industrial fishing.Deep-sea bottom trawlers drag heavy nets with steel doors and roller gear across the ocean floor, decimating ancient coral, mussel colonies, sponges, sea worms and many species that live long and breed too slowly to replenish their numbers. The technique has been compared to the clear-cutting of forests because the heavy doors – some of which weigh several tonnes and are marketed as canyonbusters – scrape the tops off of seamounts and rugged terrain.Determined to challenge this, Nouvian switched from journalism to activism, founded the Bloom Association  in 2005, and began a campaign that recently resulted in a major policy shift by the European Union.She describes her strategy as an application of investigative journalism. She first identified the problem, honed in on the causes, interviewed the major players and then sieved through reams of data to expose the ecological and economic flaws of the business.“Deep-sea bottom trawling applies the most destructive fishing to the most fragile ecosystem,” Nouvian told the  in an interview ahead of the Goldman award ceremony. “The seafloor has intricate features that form over years, like cities. Bottom trawling wipes it out.”Nouvian initially focused attention on a fishing fleet owned by Intermarché, a French supermarket chain. Her association sifted through years of corporate accounts and discovered that the fleet was chronically unprofitable even with public subsidies. In partnership with other NGOs, they also canvassed former fishing communities in France and the UK to see how fishing port communities were being ruined by industrial trawling.This was followed by a petition calling on the government to ban a practice that was environmentally destructive and economically unviable. With the help of a viral cartoon on the subject by acclaimed French illustrator Pénélope Bagieu, more than 900,000 people signed up, forcing first Intermarché, then the French and UK governments, then the European parliament and council to agree on restrictions. From June 2016, European fleets have been banned from bottom trawling at depths of more than 800m.Nouvian is now targeting pulse fishing, which uses electric currents to stun fish or induce spasms that force sole and plaice from the sediment.“This is terrifying. If we electrocute fish, we also electrocute eggs and everything else. All life in a certain space is wiped out. It sounds like science fiction, but it is real.”Under pressure from Bloom, other NGOs and small-scale fishermen’s groups, the European parliament voted to prohibit pulse fishing inside EU waters earlier this year.But she says it continues on a wide scale because the European commission is failing to enforce regulations while the EU institutions make a final ruling on whether pulse fishing should be prohibited.Nouvian has called on supermarkets to refuse to stock electric-caught fish but so far in the UK only Waitrose, Co-op and Morrisons have agreed, while Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Marks and Spencers have not replied. French retailers – who have learned not to cross this formidable campaigner – have been more responsive.The prize-winner – who complains there is only 20 hours to work in a day – is also working to ban shark-finning in Asia and lobbying the World Trade Organisation and governments around the world to end subsidies for destructive industrial fishing and to give more support to small-scale fishing communities.“There are way too many big fishing vessels and they are kept afloat with public subsidies. But there are fewer fish so they have to go further, enter deeper waters and take more types of fish,” she said. “We have the means to wipe out other species and us with it, but just because we can it does not mean we have to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72155079fe3b974626d23832e08c2e2b081a8859/118_237_2707_1625/master/2707.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e1c7be851c30f60956bf08ac0bead1","title":"south korea propaganda machine silence summit","story":"Sound system that plays pop music, radio dramas and news of the odd defection is turned off in advance of summit with NorthSouth Korea has stopped broadcasting propaganda across its border with North Korea for the first time in more than two years, in a gesture of goodwill just days before the countries’ leaders are to meet in a historic summit.The South Korean defence ministry said the broadcasts, which blare pop music and criticism of the North’s dynastic rule across the heavily armed border, fell silent at midnight on Sunday.It wasn’t immediately clear if Pyongyang, which uses loudspeakers to broadcast praise for its leader, Kim Jong-un, and patriotic songs, would reciprocate.“We hope this decision will lead both Koreas to stop mutual criticism and propaganda against each other and also contribute in creating peace and a new beginning,” the defence ministry said in a statement. The use of loudspeakers to relay ear-splitting messages that combine criticism of North Korea with praise for life in the democratic, wealthy South, has long been a source of inter-Korean tension.The decision to press the mute button came as the Wall Street Journal claimed Donald Trump would not be willing to offer North Korea significant sanctions relief before it has substantially dismantled its nuclear weapons programme.“When the president says that he will not make the mistakes of the past, that means the US will not be making substantial concessions, such as lifting sanctions, until North Korea has substantially dismantled its nuclear programmes,” the newspaper quoted a senior Trump administration official as saying.Officially known as the Joint Security Area, located near the village of Panmunjom, this is the only point along the roughly 250km long demilitarised zone where North and South Korea stand opposite each other. The site was created at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War as a meeting point to discuss the uneasy truce that ended the conflict.There are six buildings the straddle the border, three of them painted United Nations blue, where talks between the two sides occasionally take place. It is also a major tourist destination and visitors can technically cross into North Korea inside the buildings. Outside there is a raised concrete curb that marks the border. \u0026nbspBefore two American soldiers were killed in 1976, the entire area was neutral and personnel from the North and South move freely throughout the zone. Since the murders a hard border bisecting the area has been enforced. In 2017, it was the sight of a dramatic escape by a North Korean soldier who was shot while fleeing to the South.Whether or not South Korea’s broadcasts resume could depend on the progress of Kim’s meeting on Friday with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, in the first direct talks between the countries’ leaders for more than a decade.They are expected to discuss replacing the armistice that ended the Korean war in 1953 with a treaty that brings a formal end to hostilities. The two previous inter-Korea summits, held in 2000 and 2007 in Pyongyang, involved the then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun.Friday’s talks, to be held on the southern side of the truce village of Panmunjom, are the precursor to a planned summit between Kim and Donald Trump, although the date and location for their meeting have yet to be decided.South Korea’s decision to silence its cross-border propaganda machine carries significant symbolic weight, because the broadcasts have come to serve as a bellwether of the state of inter-Korean ties.Seoul briefly restarted the broadcasts in August 2015 – breaking an 11-year silence – after two of its soldiers were seriously injured by a landmine along the border, but halted them days later. They restarted in January 2016 following North Korea’s fourth nuclear test.At the end of last year, Seoul used the loudspeakers to relay news of the dramatic defection of a North Korean soldier in an attempt to compound Pyongyang’s embarrassment over the incident.But in February, North Korea turned down the volume of its own propaganda after the opening ceremony for the Pyeongchang winter Olympics, which featured the country’s athletes and cheerleaders. For more than two years, North Korean troops ranged along the demilitarised zone – the 4km-wide buffer that has separated the two countries for 65 years – and civilians living nearby have been subjected to a mixture of South Korean music and criticism of the Kim regime.South Korea’s broadcasts, aired at ear-splitting volume from 11 sites along the border, can be heard over a distance of 24km at night, and about 10km during the day. Their political message, designed to weaken public and military confidence in the regime, occasionally makes way for weather reports, domestic and international news, radio dramas and studio discussions of life the South.Seoul’s decision comes two days after North Korea said it would end its tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and close its nuclear test site.Trump, who erroneously tweeted on Sunday that North Korea had agreed to denuclearise – it has not said it will scrap its existing weapons – said the world was “a long way” from resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis.“We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won’t – only time will tell,” he said on Twitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb6309aa2eb6fbc997ddc586a3323976d22175a8/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b343a6d2cbec2d368902d14eaff52a","title":"sprinkling sand save arctic shrinking sea ice","story":"Arctic Dispatches, part 3: A pilot project at a lake in northern Alaska is one of a number aiming to slow climate change with geoengineering – but some worry about unintended consequencesAs a test location for a project that aims to ensure the livability of Earth, a frozen lake near the northern tip of Alaska could seem rather inauspicious.While the North Meadow Lake near Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, may be relatively nondescript, it will be the staging ground this month for an ambitious attempt to safeguard the Arctic’s rapidly diminishing sea ice and stave off the most punishing effects of global warming.Tiny spheres of reflective sand will be sprinkled upon the lake to see if this can prevent the lake ice from melting or slow the process down. Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice – equivalent to the size of Costa Rica – with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the.com“The ice in the Arctic isn’t going to come back by itself,” said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. “And we don’t have much time left.”Field, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore’s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. “It hit me like a train,” she said. “The importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me.“I looked at it and thought: ‘What if this is a materials problem?’ You go through the list of things that aren’t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it’s a fairly short list. I’ve been through a few options and this one has legs.”For the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota. Testing is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqiaġvik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra – there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer.“Leslie is kind of a one-off,” said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. “I think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that’s realistic and is going to save the world, I don’t know.”In March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles – the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s. The cost and logistics are daunting, however. It’s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft. Field isn’t targeting the whole Arctic region – instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard – but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour.The continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn’t certain as yet, despite a “large-scale launch” of ice covering earmarked for 2020.The world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.These “rapid and dramatic changes” are introducing a “new normal” to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.“It’s not chump change, but compared to other options it’s cost effective,” she said. “It’s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.”Ice911 isn’t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic. A team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic’s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze.“Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,” lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. “It’s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.”In the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won’t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed. No such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option “soft” or “eco” geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough. There is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun’s heat away from Earth or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to “brighten” them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia’s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin “sun shield” to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching. A separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the “StratoCruiser” – a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard’s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources.These and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive.János Pásztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored. In a speech to Arizona State University, Pásztor singled out Keith’s experiment. “Some time within the next year, we may see the world’s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,” he said.“We urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society’s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.”Some scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas. “I think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,” said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. “I don’t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.”Bitz said she was “not very optimistic” about Ice911’s plan as it creates “very small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems”, despite Field’s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. “You could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,” said Bitz. “The idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it’s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive. We need to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, first and foremost.”Even if the silica proves benign to the Arctic environment, keeping a lid on warming in the region could backfire anyway, according to Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “Weather patterns and ocean currents bring excess heat to the poles to balance out the planet, so you might invigorate those warming systems,” she said. “It might all be a bit futile.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470992.1524478874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sun has its day in the sun as sun sets on sunny weather","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHighest temperatures will be between 11 and 15 degrees with fresh and gusty southwest winds.

In a statement, the company said it cancelled a number of sailings from July 12th-29th as the German shipyard building the new vessel, the WB Yeats, informed Irish Ferries her delivery “is likely to be delayed”. The company emailed affected passengers late on Friday evening stating that while the delay had yet to be “fully confirmed by the shipyard we have, in the interests of minimising the level of potential disruption to you, taken the decision to cancel your sailing”. The company is contacting affected customers to offer alternative space on the MV Oscar Wilde for times close to their booked sailing dates. It said in the absence of an acceptable alternative, customers will be entitled to a full refund. “The schedules don’t actually overlap each other so everybody is going to be inconvenienced regrettably.“There is reservation staff working throughout the day and throughout the rest of the week. Our ambition is to facilitate every single customer according to their wishes. It is an ongoing process.” The spokesman also denied claims that have appeared on social media that the company continued to take bookings knowing the building of the ship would be delayed. “Nobody can say we took bookings knowing that there was going to be a delay. It doesn’t make sense to do that,” he said. “We did not delay at all in notifying passengers. Once we knew for sure the delay was likely, we informed customers.”Impacted customers have also been offered a €150 voucher by the company, for sailings next summer. “Notwithstanding the extraordinary nature of the delay in the delivery of the ship to us, which is outside of our control, we do really value your support and would like to offer you a goodwill gesture of a €150 electronic voucher off an Ireland-France trip for next year,” email correspondence to customers said. Once delivered, the new ferry will have space for 1,885 passengers and crew, 435 cabins and nearly 3km of car deck space. It will do three return journeys each week. The €147 million ferry was due to start servicing routes from Ireland to France and the UK in July and will be the largest and most luxurious vessel to shuttle passengers to and from Irish ports.

Pictured at the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation annual conference earlier this month are Graham Fitzpatrick, Ed Platt, John Paul Phelan and Michael Weed, who are calling for equal pay for all teachers. Photograph: Moya Nolan.A year ago the Government believed the issue of public service pay was settled until the end of 2020.An €850 million deal was to provide State employees with increases of between 6.2 and 7.4 per cent over three years.Now the Government is facing renewed pay pressures on multiple fronts.Trade unions want pay improvements for staff recruited after 2011, who currently are paid less than colleagues who are longer in service, brought forward to next year.The Government wanted to hold off on tackling this issue until the beginning of 2021.Talks between the Government and trade unions on this controversial two-tier pay system are to commence next Friday.In addition, within the next few weeks the Public Service Pay Commission is expected to produce a report examining whether there are recruitment and retentions difficulties in different parts of the public service.The first report will deal with the health service with doctors and nurses arguing strongly that better pay available overseas is encouraging staff to take up posts abroad, leaving significant vacancies in hospitals across the country.Medical organisations, for example, claim 400 full-time consultant positions are unfilled.Trade unions will want any acknowledgement by the Public Service Pay Commission that recruitment and retention pressures exist to lead to immediate talks on pay rises.The Public Service Pay Commission is also due to report on recruitment and retention difficulties in the defence forces later in the year.The  reported earlier this month that the Department of Defence is to recommend that a loyalty bonus - which was previously set at up to €22,000 - should be re-introduced to address a shortage of military pilots.This would be the first public indication that the Government acknowledges additional pay is needed to encourage the retention of key personnel in some parts of the public service.It called for Civil Service managers to be given greater pay flexibility in their attempts to recruit in areas where staff are scarce.Trade unions also want allowances for staff which were cut following the economic crash to be increased in line with pay rises under the current deal rather than in October 2020 as currently proposed.The Government is also facing into talks with general practitioners on a new contract in which they will want a reversal of significant cuts which they experienced over recent years.GPs are not public service staff.However, they provide key public services under contract which are critical to the success of the Government’s overall healthcare reforms.There are also likely to be strong calls by public service staff for the abolition of the additional, unpaid working hours, introduced after the economic crash. The Government estimates this change alone could cost over €600 million.The most immediate challenge for the Government, both politically and from the trade unions, will be in relation to pay for those recruited since January 2011.There has been a vociferous campaign in recent times - led largely by teachers - to have this two-tier pay system addressed.However, this is by no means a matter that only affects the education sector.Trade unions will demand the same when the talks start next Friday.A recent report by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform maintained that nearly 60,000 staff across the public service - or nearly 20 per cent of the total - now work on lower pay arrangements than their colleagues recruited prior to January 2011.However, if all the demands descending on the Government to deal with recruitment and retention, the provision of new services, a reversal of cuts to allowances etc are to be addressed, the cost to the public service pay bill would be far, far higher.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470889.1524466940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up to 60 000 recent public service hires could be in line for big pay increase","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers from the INTO, ASTI and TUI protesting before a Government report on pay equalisation. File photograph: Alan BetsonTens of thousands of staff who entered the public service in recent years on lower pay rates appear likely to receive special increases to allow them to catch up with longer-serving colleagues on foot of new talks between the Government and unions. The Government and public service unions are to meet on Friday to discuss ending the highly controversial two-tier pay system which has seen nearly 60,000 teachers, nurses, civil servants and others recruited since January 2011 receive less pay than those in place before that date.Highly-placed sources said a key element of the talks would be proposals to effectively allow newer entrant staff to “jump” incremental points on their pay scales. This would effectively remove the additional two lower points which were added to the bottom of the scales for newer entrants. The abolition of the two-tier pay system could be worth €3,300 on average to those taken on after 2011.However, any such move could cost the Government about €200 million, a report drawn up by the Department of Public Expenditure last March estimated. A key issue to be determined in the forthcoming talks would be how and over what time the additional points added to the pay scales would be removed. Should, for example, this issue be addressed in one go in 2019 or phased in over a longer period.There are also technical complexities as different grades of staff in the public service have incremental scales of different lengths – teachers, for example, have more than 20 points on their pay scale. The Government’s position has been that while it was prepared to carry out a review of the two-tier pay system under the terms of the most recent public service agreement, actually addressing the issue would have to wait until after the end of 2020 when the current deal expires. However, last Friday public service unions said they wanted the Government to bring forward to next year the provision of increased pay for newer entrants to the public service. Tom Geraghty, joint general secretary of Fórsa, the country’s largest public service union, said the public service staff concerned could not wait until the agreement expired at the end of 2020 “to resolve something so fundamentally unfair”.About 60,000 staff recruited since 2011 – or about 19 per cent of the total public service workforce – are impacted by the two-tier pay system. Removing the additional points on the pay scales for newer entrants would not totally end the two-tier remuneration system. It would not address allowances which were separately removed or reduced for new entrants during the austerity era. Meanwhile, top level management in the Defence Forces believe that an independent review board should be established to examine the totality of remuneration on offer to military personnel, including basic pay and allowances. It is understood to have suggested that military service allowances paid to all personnel should be increased, weekend security duty allowances should be restored and special payments reintroduced to retain key staff such as pilots, air traffic controllers, bomb disposal experts and engineers. This recommendation is expected to be at the heart of a submission prepared by the Defence Forces for the Public Service Pay Commission, which is looking at recruitment and retention difficulties in keys parts of the State sector.It is understood that management of the forces has concluded that the current trend of premature voluntary retirements is not sustainable, and that the rate of staff leaving will not be alleviated solely through the current high rates of recruitment.It is understood that military management has estimated that “based on current premature voluntary retirement rates and assuming the maintenance of the current rate of recruitment of 800 personnel per year, the official establishment strength of the Defence Forces of 9,500 would not be reached until 2031.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"bertie ahern abruptly ends interview after being questioned on mahon tribunal","story":"  April 21, 2018Former taoiseach \u0026lsquohappy\u0026rsquo he cleared his name after allegations he received payments   April 22, 2018Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern Ireland Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the Guardian. “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3471034.1524485745!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s a boy britain s latest royal baby is born","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Prince William (R) stands next to his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge,  with their  daughter Charlotte on  May 2nd, 2015. File photograph: Andy RainEPA Britain’s Duchess of Cambridge has given birth to a son weighing 8lbs 7oz, Kensington Palace has announced.Kate, the wife of Britain’s prince William, was admitted to hospital in the early stages of labour on Monday to give birth to the couple’s third child.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as the couple are officially known, drove from their home at Kensington Palace in central London to St Mary’s Hospital in west London where their other two children, George and Charlotte, were also born.“The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London, earlier this morning in the early stages of labour,” Kensington Palace said in a statement.The new baby will be Queen Elizabeth’s sixth great-grandchild and fifth-in-line to the British throne behind siblings Prince George (4), his two-year-old sister Princess Charlotte, their father William, and grandfather and heir Prince Charles.William’s younger brother Harry, who marries US actress Meghan Markle next month, will fall to sixth on the list.As with her two previous pregnancies, Kate (36), suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness which can cause severe nausea and vomiting and requires supplementary hydration and nutrients.Kate’s last engagement ahead of the birth was on March 22nd when she and William attended a number of events in London to celebrate the Commonwealth ahead of a meeting of its leaders last week.Mary, Alice, and Victoria are among the favourite names with bookmakers if the baby is a girl, while Albert, Arthur and Fred are the favourites for a boy.The baby will be born at the private Lindo wing of St Mary’s, where maternity packages cost in the region of £6,000 pounds . William (35) was born at the same hospital to the late Princess Diana in 1982.In keeping with tradition, the official announcement of the birth will be made by placing a notice on an easel in the forecourt of the queen’s London home, Buckingham Palace.William and Kate met as students at St Andrews University in Scotland. They got married in a pageant-packed ceremony at Westminster Abbey in April 2011 and have since become well-known across the global stage.Having had homes in north Wales and Norfolk in eastern England, William and Kate now live at Kensington Palace to allow the prince to dedicate more time to royal duties on behalf of his grandmother.Last year William gave up his day job as an air ambulance pilot to concentrate on his official role, having faced some criticism from British newspapers who dubbed him “workshy Wills”.However, he has also been determined to play a hands-on role in bringing up his children while also protecting their privacy, an issue close to his heart after his mother’s death in a 1997 Paris car crash as her limousine sped away from chasing paparazzi.“I think he takes on a lot more engagements than he used to,” said royal biographer Claudia Joseph. “But compared to members of the general public who have full-time jobs, he still has some time off to look after the children, to give them their baths, to put them to bed and I think he’ll continue to do that,” Joseph said.The British royals are rarely out of the media glare, but the baby arrives at a time when the Windsors have particularly been in the limelight.On Saturday William joined the queen and other senior royals, with the exception of Kate, as the monarch celebrated her 92nd birthday at a televised concert.The queen also played a prominent role at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London last week, where it was announced that Charles would succeed her as head of the network of mainly former British colonies.The wedding of William and Kate and the birth of George, who is destined to be a future king, generated a worldwide media frenzy. While interest in their third child has been more muted, large numbers of photographers and broadcasters were massing outside the hospital in anticipation of the new royal arrival, along with some dedicated royal fans.“We’ve been camped here outside the hospital for 15 days,” said John Loughrey (63), from south London, who was wearing a Union Jack onesie and hat and holding a baby doll adorned with a crown that said ‘feed me mummy’ every few seconds.“We’ve been coming out doing this for 21 years. We were here for George and Charlotte and we’ll be there for the royal wedding too,” he said, referring to Harry and Meghan Markle.The birth will give Kate’s own family another cause for celebration after it was reported by British media on Sunday that her sister Pippa was pregnant with her first child. – ReutersThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

The equivalent number in November 2016 was 1.7 millionThe number of zero hour contracts in the UK labour market rose by around 100,000 last year according to the Office for National Statistics.The agency reported that in its latest survey of firms there were 1.8 million contracts that did not guarantee a minimum numbers of hours in the year to November 2017. The equivalent number in November 2016 was 1.7 million.The Taylor review fails to address underlying workplace problemsHowever, as a share of all contracts, the proportion of zero hours contracts was unchanged at 6 per cent.The ONS also said the survey that produced the data changed from being voluntary to compulsory between the two periods, meaning that the year-on-year comparison should be “treated with caution”.The highest number of zero hour contracts recorded by the survey was 2.1 million in Mar 2015, when they accounted for 7 per cent of contracts.The agency also reported that the number of people employed on such contracts in their main job in the three months to December 2017 was 901,000, around 2.8 per cent of all people in employment.This latest estimate, based on a separate survey of employees, was 4,000 lower than the three months to December 2016, when the 905,000 zero hours workers also represented 2.8 per cent of the labour force.According to the employees survey the number of people on zero hours contracts shot up from just 190,000 in 2011, although the statisticians say a proportion of this increase might be related to an increasing number of people recognising they were on such contracts after they were broadly publicised in the media.The rise in zero hour contracts has been of growing concern for politicians in recent years.The independent Taylor review, commissioned by Theresa May, recommended last year that the Low Pay Commission consider introducing a higher rate of minimum wage for zero hours workers and said the government should bring forward legislation to allow agency workers on zero hours contracts to formalise their status.Cameron on zero hours contractIn its response, the government committed only to providing a “right to request a more predictable contract”.Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation said that the tightening of the labour market in recent years appeared to be curbing the growth of zero hours contracts.“Nonetheless, around 900,000 workers are on a zero hours contract, including one in twelve young people,” he said.“And while some workers appreciate the flexibility they bring, for others they bring insecurity and lower pay.”The ONS employees survey showed that a quarter of people on zero hours contracts wanted more hours in their current job. They are also more likely to be aged 16-24, working part-time, or women, than those on regular contracts.The industry sectors with the largest shares of workers on zero hours are accommodation and food (11.8 per cent), followed by health and social work, transport and administration (all on around 4 per cent).Office for National Statisticsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, said the upcoming decision on interest rates is “just one of many factors affecting the outlook for sterling”. “With UK economic growth lagging behind all other major economies, and the path of Brexit once more looking distinctly rocky, sterling’s recent strength is in danger of reversing sharply, particularly if Prime Minister May’s position comes under further pressure,” she said. GDP figures are due to be published on Friday, and are expected to show the UK economy grew by just 0.2-0.3 per cent in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister may be forced to U-turn on her previous insistence that the UK will leave the customs union after Brexit. The pound strengthened against the euro on Monday, rising 0.31 per cent to €1.1428.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Especially, it seems, in homes in the south east.A year-long study has found clothes-eating moths are most common in England’s warmer regions – notably London and the Home Counties.The survey – carried out by English Heritage – also discovered an “alarmingly high” number of the particularly destructive pale-backed clothes moths across the country. A series of mild winters is thought to be behind their rise.The project, called Operation Clothes Moth, was launched in a bid to help the organisation understand how it can best protect its collection of historic wool carpets, tapestries and period clothing at properties such as Gainsborough Old Hall in Lincolnshire  and Eltham Palace in London.Eltham Palace in South London (PA)Members of the public were asked to monitor the fabric-munching pests in their own homes. Some 5,000 traps were distributed across 42 counties.And the results showed that homes in the South East were significantly more likely to attract the creatures.Traps set up there caught an average 23 moths. In the south west – the second most popular region – that figure was 17. The West Midlands came third with 16 moths per trap.The East Midlands, North West and North East recorded the lowest levels.The survey also found, perhaps not altogether unexpectedly, that flats with shared walls and pre-Fifties houses with more voids were the most likely properties to be affected.Amber Xavier-Rowe, head of collections conservation with English Heritage, said: The response from the public has been brilliant and the data we\u0027ve gathered has been invaluable in informing our understanding of the clothes moth threat.Now that we know where the clothes moth concentration is the highest, we can put in place extra measures to ensure that our historic houses in these areas are fully protected and preserved for future generations.We wouldn\u0027t have been able to do that without the public\u0027s help.She added: Operation Clothes Moth has really resonated with a lot of people who yes, want to help us protect our collections but also to protect their favourite woolly jumpers.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

In essence, there is a concern that some voters will be disenfranchised as a result of restrictive identification requirements,” writes Claire Collier, the commission\u0027s legal secretary.The intervention comes after a slew of stories this week about members of the Windrush generation facing problems with access to healthcare and other state services.Many immigrants who arrived from the Caribbean between the late Forties and Seventies have no record of their legal status.Responding to the letter, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the newspaper: “It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It’s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.”The new electoral rules are set to be tried for the first time in five local authority areas – Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking – during this year’s local elections on 3 May. If a success, they will be rolled out nationally from 2020.Although they are being implemented in response to perceived increase in voter identity fraud, figures previously reported by The Independent suggest the risk of such crime is minimal.A study by the Electoral Commission found just 28 allegations of someone having lied about their identity at a polling station in 2017, despite almost 45 million votes having been cast.Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction. The man in question was fined after admitting to voting twice for Labour.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

Always happy to discuss,” Mr Dreschler tweeted.Labour seized on the hints that votes on the customs union could be a “matter of confidence”, pointing that No 10 appeared to rule that out as recently as February.But Jeremy Hunt made clear the government would not give way, saying: “The prime minister has been totally clear right from the outset. We’re not going to be part of the customs union or a customs union.”Tensions rose over the weekend, after a Downing Street aide told The Sunday Times that Ms May and her allies “would not be crying into our beer” if parliament forced the government to back down. The scenario was said to have been “war gamed” at a recent meeting, with the conclusion that only Boris Johnson and Liam Fox would resign.The controversy will come to a head after a heavy defeat for the government in the Lords last week.

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

Pyongyang also said it was closing down a nuclear test site and would instead pursue economic growth and peace.The decision has been welcomed by world leaders, including US president Donald Trump, who is set to meeting Mr Kim next month.Mr Moon said: “North Korea’s decision to freeze its nuclear programme is a significant decision for the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. It is a green light that raises the chances of positive outcomes at the North’s summits with South Korea and the United States.He added that if North Korea goes the path of complete denuclearisation, “a bright future” for the secretive communist state can be guaranteed. North Korea – South Korea relations: in picturesNorth Korea – South Korea relations: in picturesA solid-fuel Pukguksong-2 missile lifts off during its launch test in North Korea on May 22, 2017.

Look forward to our Summit.”Kim Jong-un’s offer to end nuclear tests is a major test for TrumpHowever, he sounded a more cautious note, writing on Twitter: “We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won’t – only time will tell.”The US president had earlier claimed in a tweet that North Korea “agreed to denuclearisation”.In fact, Pyongyang stopped short of suggesting it would give up its existing nuclear weapons or scale back production of missiles and their related component parts. “As the weaponisation of nuclear weapons has been verified, it is not necessary for us to conduct any more nuclear tests or test launches of mid- and long-range missiles or ICBMs,” Mr Kim said, according to North Korean news agency KCNA. “The northern nuclear test site has completed its mission.”He added: “The whole party and the whole nation should now focus on the development of the socialist economy.

The Kremlin isn’t ready to do it just yet –\u0026nbspbut that doesn’t mean they won’t break the\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbsptryingOn Friday 13 April, inside a cramped Moscow courtroom, judge Yulia Smolina made Russian internet history. It took her just 19 minutes to agree to a government request to block the popular messaging app Telegram. The brutal efficiency of the decision – which took hold even before an appeal took place – suggested everyone thought implementation would be easy. Communications regulator Roskomnadzor began implementing the ban last Monday, ordering internet providers to block access to the messaging app. A game of hide and seek ensued. As soon as the first subnets were blocked, Telegram switched its servers to alternate IP addresses. Regulators responded by blocking entire internet subsets – to general calamity. By midday on 19 April, it had banned a total of 18 million IP addresses (compare this to 38,000 in all previous years).Importing apple trees instead of apples, Russia secures foodMany businesses, including parts of the banking infrastructure, were caught in Roskomnadzor’s net. On Sunday, Gmail and some other Google services went offline for many Russians, as the authorities shut down major networks they believed were being used to circumvent the ban.Telegram, meanwhile, remained accessible to the vast majority of Russian users. The Kremlin faced an embarrassing reality that the internet was stronger than its heaviest fist. But for many, the fear is that sharper impacts will now follow. Once a largely free space, the Russian internet has been increasingly subjected to regulation and censorship. The first blocklists appeared in 2012. Now, the decision of a remote Siberian village court is enough for a site to be struck off completely. Such, for example, was the fate that befell the country’s leading LGBT website, gay.ru, earlier this year – and any number of dating and porn sites the year before. Russia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsKremlin threatens to expel all UK media if Britain shuts down RTRepublicans say they found ‘no evidence’ Trump conspired with RussiaInstragram ‘removed photos of Kremin leader with escorts aboard yacht’In 2015, a new law was passed forcing foreign tech companies to move Russian data to servers inside Russia. Most refused to comply, but that may change. Kremlin hardliners have meanwhile made little secret of ongoing work to build an analogue to the Great Chinese Firewall. The Chinese model is now one of three scenarios under consideration, said independent observer Konstantin Gaaze. The first is to continue as if nothing has happened. Russia could certainly continue its haphazard approach of blocking subsets and IP addresses. But if it is to appear remotely effective, it will need the agreement of Apple and Google – for example, to block the notifications the app is using to update users on new server addresses. In 2016, the tech giants did cooperate with the Kremlin to remove the much less popular LinkedIn platform from its stores, but it is unclear if they will do so in these more controversial circumstances. On the other hand, Russia could choose to revisit and fudge the original court decision. Or it could take a sledgehammer to the internet with a system of filters and whitelists. “The security council met on Thursday, and it appears no major decision has been taken,” Mr Gaaze told The Independent. “Things are likely to continue as they are until the inauguration in May – then it is anyone’s guess”Others are less sure that Russia can make a firewall work. “It isn’t workable right now, as we don’t have the technology to deal with the data involved,” said Andrei Soldatov, author of The Red Web. China has been ready to lend a hand to the Kremlin, the security expert told The Independent, but the “paranoia” of Russia’s security services has prevailed.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

The unexpected resistance of Telegram may change that. “The severity of Russia’s legislation has always been compensated by the lack of enforcement – that was the old adage,” said IT entrepreneur David Homak. “Telegram may not yet be blocked, but the Kremlin has shown it is ready for a battle, demonstrating strength in the most primitive sense .” In an interview with Izvestia, Roskomnadzor’s chief Alexander Zharov appeared to be clearing the way for a renewed assault on those tech companies refusing to move their data to Russia. “We will finish our compliance checks by the end of this year,” he told the pro-Kremlin newspaper. “If nothing happens … then obviously the question of blocking arises.”For Mr Soldatov, last week’s technical failure might be interpreted as political success. “After a week or two of this, the Kremlin might come to a view that it’s taken all the heat its possible to muster,” he said. “At that point, nothing is stopping it moving against Facebook”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The equivalent number in November 2016 was 1.7 millionThe number of zero hour contracts in the UK labour market rose by around 100,000 last year according to the Office for National Statistics.The agency reported that in its latest survey of firms there were 1.8 million contracts that did not guarantee a minimum numbers of hours in the year to November 2017. The equivalent number in November 2016 was 1.7 million.The Taylor review fails to address underlying workplace problemsHowever, as a share of all contracts, the proportion of zero hours contracts was unchanged at 6 per cent.The ONS also said the survey that produced the data changed from being voluntary to compulsory between the two periods, meaning that the year-on-year comparison should be “treated with caution”.The highest number of zero hour contracts recorded by the survey was 2.1 million in Mar 2015, when they accounted for 7 per cent of contracts.The agency also reported that the number of people employed on such contracts in their main job in the three months to December 2017 was 901,000, around 2.8 per cent of all people in employment.This latest estimate, based on a separate survey of employees, was 4,000 lower than the three months to December 2016, when the 905,000 zero hours workers also represented 2.8 per cent of the labour force.According to the employees survey the number of people on zero hours contracts shot up from just 190,000 in 2011, although the statisticians say a proportion of this increase might be related to an increasing number of people recognising they were on such contracts after they were broadly publicised in the media.The rise in zero hour contracts has been of growing concern for politicians in recent years.The independent Taylor review, commissioned by Theresa May, recommended last year that the Low Pay Commission consider introducing a higher rate of minimum wage for zero hours workers and said the government should bring forward legislation to allow agency workers on zero hours contracts to formalise their status.Cameron on zero hours contractIn its response, the government committed only to providing a “right to request a more predictable contract”.Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation said that the tightening of the labour market in recent years appeared to be curbing the growth of zero hours contracts.“Nonetheless, around 900,000 workers are on a zero hours contract, including one in twelve young people,” he said.“And while some workers appreciate the flexibility they bring, for others they bring insecurity and lower pay.”The ONS employees survey showed that a quarter of people on zero hours contracts wanted more hours in their current job. They are also more likely to be aged 16-24, working part-time, or women, than those on regular contracts.The industry sectors with the largest shares of workers on zero hours are accommodation and food (11.8 per cent), followed by health and social work, transport and administration (all on around 4 per cent).Office for National Statisticsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?
