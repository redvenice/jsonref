Trying to cut our own fringe will make sure we never attempt it again.One such lesson we must learn: If you’re getting a spray tan, it’s not a good idea to cry immediately after.Rather than making this mistake yourself, simply learn from 17-year-old Alex Vinklarek, who’s gone ahead and sobbed post-spray-tan so you don’t have to.‘Tuesday night I went to the tanning salon because I have the cheerleading worlds this weekend,’ Alex tells . ‘I only get spray tans before cheer competitions.‘I’m very aware of what happens when water touches it before you shower it off, but after I got sprayed I went in my car and started watching videos on Twitter.‘I saw this really heartwarming video of a dog reuniting with its owner.’(Picture: @alexvinklarek)‘Two drops rolled down each side of my face,’ says Alex. ‘I immediately realised and opened my camera to look at it. I saw that I had two streaks and I started bawling my eyes out, so that’s when it got really bad.‘I kept trying to stop crying but every time I looked at myself I cried more because it looked so awful.’Alex was left with stark white streaks down her face.The good news is her mishap has provided entertainment for plenty of people, as well as spreading an important lesson. Alex’s tweet of her cry-stained face has been shared more than 16,000 times.Oh, and don’t worry – Alex managed to fix things before her cheerleading competition.Picture: @alexvinklarek)‘I was going to dinner at the time so when I got to the restaurant I washed my whole face off but some of it had already developed and the next day I had very faint white streaks down my face,’ Alex remembers.‘I went back to the salon the next day and got them to spray my face again so it was fixed.‘I ended up sending pictures to my friends and they thought it was so funny so they told me to post on Twitter.‘I initially expected maybe 30 likes and when I woke up the next morning I had over 1,000 retweets and 20,000 likes. I never thought the whole world would find this as funny as my friends and I did.‘I think it’s crazy but so awesome that it’s gone viral and I’m happy people get to enjoy the pictures like my friends and I did.’We did enjoy the pictures, and would recommend all tanning shops stick them up on their walls to remind people why they need to steer clear of strong emotions after getting sprayed.Judging from the replies to her tweet, Alex isn’t the only one who’s fallen victim to tear stains – clearly we need a reminder.Cutting through the bullsh*t of ‘natural’ ingredients in food and cosmeticsMORE: Woman left with swollen, bruised, burst lips after injections went wrongMORE: How about covering your entire body in glittery Unicorn Snot sunscreen?MORE: You can now paint your lashes with cannabis oil infused mascara"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9569637.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"man caught driving tesla from passenger seat on m1 gets road ban","story":"A Tesla driver who climbed into the passenger seat after turning on autopilot on the M1 has been banned from driving for 18 months.Bhavesh Patel, 39, even had his hands behind his head when a passenger spotted him speeding along at 40mph.He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at St Albans Crown Court on Friday, April 20, claiming he had been ‘silly’, but said the car was ‘amazing’ and he was the ‘unlucky one who got caught’.Patel was driving his wife’s white Tesla S 60 along the northbound carriageway of the M1, between junctions 8 and 9 near Hemel Hempstead, last May, when he was spotted by fellow drivers.Patel, of Alfreton Road, Nottingham, was happily sat in the passenger seat with his hands behind his head, MailOnline reported.Bhavesh Patel was caught in the passenger seat of the Tesla (Picture: Hertfordshire Police)Investigating officer PC Kirk Caldicutt slammed Patel as ‘grossly irresponsible’, risking lives with his prank.He said: ‘He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day.‘This case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar.

It’s scared of the memory and pain its been through.‘People need to have an appreciation of what an animal might be like in the wild. It’s adapted to survice in a really specific environment and it’s being put in a situation where it can’t.’Nine schoolchildren stabbed to death, 12 injured, by \u0027bullied pupil\u0027 in ChinaTigers, a solitary animal with a usual range of around 10km, are also put through immense suffering because they are ‘forced into unnatural situations day in, day out’.They are separated from their mothers at a young age, chained to concrete blocks and handed out to tourists to be bottle fed.‘When they’re not being used a a photo prop they’re locked in their cage,’ Chiara said.Any place that allows direct contact with a wild animal is a ‘red flag’ (Picture: World Animal Protection)‘It’s a solitary animal, an elusive animal and you’re putting it in a situation where it’s being constantly stressed.’She added: ‘Riding an elephant, ride trips and shows are red flags. If a venue is allowing that really close contact chances are the animal is being controlled by fear and pain.’‘There’s been an expectation that being near a wild animal is to touch it but we wouldn’t encourage that.‘In a place like Thailand anyone can call themselves a sanctuary – it’s down to the tourists to know their research and make an informed decision.The needs of wild animals are too specific for many keepers to look after them (Picture: World Animal Protection)‘When looking at a venue a real goldmine of information is bad reviews on Tripadvisor. Have a look at the one star and two star reviews.’Another good rule of thumb, she said, was to have an understanding of what animals holidaymakers might encounter before they go.She added: ‘They’re sentient beings with needs who suffer pain – and people end up creating a demand for this. But you also have people trying to provide an opportunity for their family.‘It’s about trying to facilitate a transition.

Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

At times, she juggled all three at once.           Louis Mountbatten with his wife Edwina and the wife of U Kyin, the Burmese Ambassador at the Burmese Embassy in 1956Next came playboy Larry Gray, before she went on a Mexican cruise and jumped into bed with the elder of two Californian brothers, Ted Phillips, quickly followed by his sibling Bunny.This serial sexual gallivanting went on until the birth of her second daughter Pamela in 1929.By now, Mountbatten, too, was seeking other women. In 1931, he was flirting with the 18-year-old future Duchess of Argyll and even kept her photo in his cabin. He also fell for a young French woman, Yola Letellier, who inspired the French novel on which the 1958 film musical Gigi was based.As Mountbatten himself once famously put it: \u0027Edwina and I spent all our married lives getting into other people\u0027s beds.\u0027 Edwina died in her sleep in 1960, aged 58.

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

A flicker of sadness comes into his eyes. ‘No. Not this trip.’Davis has always guarded the privacy of his family. Married to Doreen for 45 years, he says only that the Davis clan is very close, and his office is filled with photographs of them.

We don’t talk politics at home.

What do you think the people have voted for?’’ It’s the first political thing she has said for months.’The question of whether Britain stays in the customs union — which would prevent the Government negotiating new trade deals with the rest of the world — is also causing serious tensions in the Cabinet, not least with Chancellor Philip Hammond.                             Imagine going clothes shopping and 27 other people have to agree what you’re going to wear                        David Davis on Brexit negotiations Theresa May is under pressure from Tory rebels to agree to a so-called ‘customs partnership’ under which the Government would collect EU tariffs on goods that pass through the UK.

We are leaving the customs union. We have to leave it. It’s what the people asked for.’He leaves us in no doubt that he sees his role as not just representing the Government.‘The people have spoken. They rejected the downbeat view of Project Fear. I have 17.5 million bosses — the ones who voted for Brexit. There is no question that leaving the customs union was a condition of Brexit.’In a pointed warning to the rebels, who include the Europhile veteran Tory Ken Clarke, he says: ‘In our manifesto we said unequivocally that we will leave the single market and the customs union.

It could soon be grim down south as a result of global warming, meteorologists have predictedHigh-intensity rainstorms that see 10mm (0.4in) or more of rain an hour are likely to become more frequent, the study found, while less intense rainy weather is set to become less common.Steven Chan, a visiting scientist with the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: Developing an improved understanding of rainfall patterns until the end of the century is vital as it allows governments to plan for potential impacts of drought or flooding events.The study, published in the journal Climate Dynamics, only uses one model so is not able to assess how likely the results might be, but does provide an initial look at the types of changes to rainfall patterns northern Britain could see with high greenhouse gas emissions, the Met Office said.The research comes after an earlier Met Office study which looked at southern Britain.Later in the year, work on UK climate projections will build on the approach used in the study while looking at a spread of potential outcomes and how likely they are to occur.The research comes as parts of Britain face a deluge, with five days of rain on the way.More than an inch of rain fell in parts of the West Country in the 24 hours to yesterday lunchtime, and almost an inch in South Wales.Meanwhile, most areas of England and Wales were grey and wet – and the soggy conditions are set to linger across the country today too.The South Coast and South West England are likely to clear up as the day goes on but could then be hit by heavy showers later on."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/17/4B45D9D800000578-5635073-image-a-13_1524156155700.jpg","title":"Passenger sues Southwest Airlines exploding engine","story":"    This was the Row 14 seat which Riordan was sitting in when she was sucked towards the window at 32,000ft.

Both Russia and Iran have deployed forces to Syria to back up Assad against anti-government rebels.          Mr Lavrov said the three countries \u0027must help the Syrians finish cleansing their country of terrorists\u0027          Cavusoglu meanwhile criticised the U.S. for supporting Syria\u0027s main Kurdish militia, which played a key role in rolling back ISIS and now controls much of northern and eastern SyriaCritics of the Astana talks are \u0027trying to show that they today decide all the affairs in our world, but fortunately their time has passed,\u0027 Lavrov said.Nevertheless he implicitly criticised Damascus after it blocked UN humanitarian aid to the town of Douma in Eastern Ghouta, saying Moscow was calling for the regime to be more \u0027flexible.\u0027The Russian foreign minister earlier held separate bilateral talks with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu and then Iran\u0027s Mohammad Javad Zarif.Meeting his Turkish counterpart, the Russian diplomat stressed the \u0027great importance\u0027 both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attach to improving relations.   Yet the latest talks in Moscow came as the alleged chemical attack in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7 has prompted sharply differing responses from Turkey and Russia.\u0027I curse those who carried out this massacre,\u0027 President Erdogan said, welcoming Western air strikes in retaliation as \u0027appropriate\u0027.           International aid groups have repeatedly accused the Syrian government of preventing the delivery of aid to besieged, rebel-held areas          A bombed out building in Douma near where the chemical attack landedIran and Russia again slammed Western strikes on Syria over the chlorine or sarin gas attack.Mr Lavrov said they \u0027set back efforts to promote the political process\u0027 and Zarif criticised Washington\u0027s \u0027destructive role\u0027.French President Emmanuel Macron this month suggested the air strikes had driven a wedge between Ankara and Moscow, prompting an angry denial from Mr Cavusoglu.Alexander Shumilin, a Middle East expert at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies in Moscow, however, said the Douma fallout had \u0027caused a crack in the alliance of three countries\u0027.Alexey Malashenko, a specialist in the Syria conflict, said the trio have a \u0027very shaky\u0027 alliance and \u0027there\u0027s no way they can reach an agreement\u0027 over the suspected chemical attack.Nevertheless, the limited nature of US-led strikes suggests the \u0027peak of tensions has passed\u0027, he said.The next Syria talks in Astana are set for May 14.          Eight rounds of talks under United Nations auspices in Geneva have made little headway, with Assad\u0027s government taking little interest.Ankara has called for Assad\u0027s removal throughout the war, but has worked increasingly closely with Moscow and Tehran in recent months in an attempt to find a solution to the conflict.In January, Russia held a showpiece conference in the Black Sea resort of Sochi with largely pro-regime delegates, which saw boycotts by rebels and made little progress.Mr Lavrov on Saturday said it achieved \u0027breakthrough results,\u0027 however.Putin hosted a summit on Syria with the Iranian and Turkish presidents in November. They then met again in Ankara this month. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/15/4BA61FD900000578-0-image-m-39_1524927570314.jpg","title":"Former X Factor star Joe McElderry cancels gig venue sent suspicious letter","story":"    Former X Factor star Joe McElderry was forced to cancel a gig at the last minute after it emerged the venue had received a \u0027suspicious letter\u0027 three days before\u0027Upon hearing this I immediately told the theatre manager that the show would not be going ahead and to get everyone out of the building ASAP.\u0027He tweeted to his followers prior to releasing the statement: \u0027Due to an incident beyond our control last night at The Empire Theatre Consett, Joe\u0027s performance was cancelled. All ticket info please contact the box office.\u0027Fans have tweeted the star messages of support.Rosie said: \u0027You did exactly the right thing in my opinion.

Guests were served Segura Viudas cava by young female waiting staff dressed in short red tennis dresses.It is in stark contrast to the humble foundations of TSB, which was founded by the Reverend Henry Duncan in 1810, to lend cash to his poorest parishioners.Mr Oliu, who has been blamed for trying to mastermind the IT upgrade of TSB from Spain, was seen drinking a beer on a balcony yesterday afternoon while he hosted other invited executives and their wives.They looked down on the forecourt where other VIPs ate appetisers of Spanish tapas.Mr Oliu then headed to the gourmet restaurant reserved for VIPs and shook hands and chatted to other guests.TSB chief says the bank\u0027s IT chaos is bringing company to...\u0027Deeply sorry\u0027 TSB boss pledges compensation for \u0027up to two...Share this articleExecutives sat at long tables inside and were served a lavish lunch. Sabadell had issued a statement boasting of the successful upgrade to the TSB bank system. It told how the multi-million pound project moved 5.5million UK customers on to a new system designed in Spain.Mr Oliu had said that with the IT upgrade Sabadell ‘had proven its technological management capacity… on an international scale.’ The document was deleted shortly after as the scale of the problems besetting UK customers emerged. Images on social network LinkedIn then emerged of IT workers in Spain who oversaw the disastrous transfer celebrating with sparkling wine.They included the captions ‘TSB transfer done and dusted!’ and ‘Hell of a team!’, according to The Guardian newspaper. The pictures were posted just as the disaster was beginning after the switchover happened at the weekend.TSB customers continued to suffer problems with their online banking last night, including wages failing to be paid into their accounts and bills going unpaid.          Jaime Guardiola Romojaro, centre, chatting to fellow guests at the event, where executives were served a lavish lunchOthers said they have been turned away in shops when their cards failed to work.The bank admitted yesterday that half of its five million customers were still unable to access their online accounts.Those that were able to log in endured problems including missing standing orders, and in some cases, seeing the wrong balances.Business customers of TSB reported they had been unable to make the usual payroll runs, meaning customers of other banks have also been affected. At one point yesterday afternoon, customers reported that the internal systems in some branches had also gone down. TSB branches have opened for 12 hours a day, and TSB chief executive Paul Pester faces a parliamentary investigation and calls for him to quit.Many customers have threatened to leave the bank and the comparison website Go Compare, said that it has seen a 100 per cent surge of customers to its bank account switching service.Customer Melanie Azzopardi tweeted: ‘This is absolutely ridiculous. Can’t transfer money online. Trying to call and have been in a queue for 33 minutes.‘Not how I want to spend my day. I will open an account elsewhere.’TSB customers are being targeted by scam emails claiming to be from the bank. They are receiving messages urging them to click on a link in the email to access their accounts. Instead they are tricked into downloading rogue software. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/17/4B45D9D800000578-5635073-image-a-13_1524156155700.jpg","title":"Passenger sues Southwest Airlines exploding engine","story":"    This was the Row 14 seat which Riordan was sitting in when she was sucked towards the window at 32,000ft.

In his multiverse, the anguish of witches who love mortal men, the ferocious joy of fighting and hunger, fear, love and protectiveness experienced by two children on the verge of adolescence are powerfully conveyed in the direct, exact prose of a master.Another gorgeously sorcerous writer is AS Byatt. Her descriptions of Victorian England in Possession, and her short stories, are saturated with sensuous intelligence even when not directly supernatural, these have the feel of a fairytale.If it is Updike’s realist magic you are after, then Meg Wolitzer is, like him, a lyrical chronicler of love and marriage – but unlike Updike, brilliant at female characters as well as male ones. Her descriptions in The Interestings and The Female Persuasion of loneliness, love, growing maturity and reading itself evoke quotidian joys and sorrows with humour, generosity and hope.Diana Evans is another superb domestic realist. Her new novel, Ordinary People, contains some of the best descriptions of happy and unhappy sex I’ve read since Ian McEwan’s Atonement. She writes about black south Londoners struggling with young families, ambition, adultery and disappointment with the wry insights Updike gave to his white east coasters.If you’ve got a question for Book Clinic, submit it below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/402ad69e03f45b0823a8e1b0a3c529045d378355/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0283d0a9d80039ef1788b48b7ce000d","title":"top writers choose their perfect","story":"Crime fiction is now the UK’s bestselling genre. So which crime novels should everyone read? We asked the writers who know ...This is the perfect crime novel. It’s beautifully written – elegiac, emotionally intelligent, evocative of the landscape and history that holds its characters in thrall – and its clever plotting delivers a genuine shock. There’s intellectual satisfaction in working out a plot involving disappearing children, whose counterpoint is Mahler’s Kindertotenlieder. There’s darkness and light, fear and relief. And then there’s the cross-grained pairing of Dalziel and Pascoe. Everything about this book is spot on.Although Hill’s roots were firmly in the traditional English detective novel, he brought to it an ambivalence and ambiguity that allowed him to display the complexities of contemporary life. He created characters who changed and developed in response to their experiences. I urge you to read this with a glass of Andy Dalziel’s favourite Highland Park whisky.• Insidious Intent by Val McDermid is published by Sphere.My formative reading was before the internet, before fanzines, before also-boughts, so for me the “best ever” is inevitably influenced by the gloriously chanced-upon lucky finds, the greatest of which was a 60 cent Belmont US paperback, bought in an import record shop on a back street in Birmingham in 1969. It had a lurid purple cover, and an irresistible strapline: “She was beautiful, young, blonde, and a junkie … I had to help her!” It turned out to be Canadian, set in Montreal. The hero was a solid stiff named Maxwell Dent. The villain was a dealer named The Back Man. The blonde had an older sister. Dent’s sidekicks were jazz pianists. The story was patient, suspenseful, educational and utterly superb. In many ways it’s the target I still aim at.• The Midnight Line by Lee Child is published by Bantam.Does this count as a crime novel? I think so. Dickens presents us with a mazey mystery, a shocking murder, a charismatic police detective, a slippery lawyer and a plethora of other memorable characters – many of whom are suspects. The story has pace and humour, is bitingly satirical about the English legal process, and also touches on large moral and political themes. As in all great crime novels, the central mystery is a driver for a broad and deep investigation of society and culture. And there’s a vibrant sense of place, too – in this case, London, a city built on secret connections, a location Dickens knows right down to its dark, beating heart.• Rather Be the Devil by Ian Rankin is published by Orion. Siege Mentality by Chris Brookmyre is published by Little, Brown.This is my current favourite, in its own way just as good as Murder on the Orient Express. As well as being a perfectly constructed mystery, it’s a gripping, acutely observed story about a group of people, their ambitions, loves and regrets. The characters are vividly alive, even the more minor ones, and the pace is expertly handled. The outdoor swimming pool scene in which Poirot discovers the murder is, I think, the most memorable discovery-of-the-body scene in all of crime fiction. Interestingly, Christie is said to have believed that the novel would have been better without Poirot. His presence here is handled differently – he feels at one remove from the action for much of the time – but it works brilliantly, since he is the stranger who must decipher the baffling goings on in the Angkatell family. The murderer’s reaction to being confronted by Poirot is pure genius. It would have been so easy to give that character, once exposed, the most obvious motivation, but the contents of this killer’s mind turn out to be much more interesting …• Did You See Melody by Sophie Hannah is published by Hodder.I first came to Rebecca, published in 1938, with one of the most recognisable first lines in literature, not knowing exactly what to expect. That it was a classic I was in no doubt, but a classic what? I suspected a drama, possibly a romance, a book heavy on character but light on plot and one I’d read and then forget. How wrong I was.It is a dark, brooding psychological thriller, hauntingly beautiful, literature yes, but with a killer plot. I loved everything about it. The way Du Maurier slowly twists the screw until we have no idea who to trust, the fact that the title character never appears and exists only as an absence at the heart of the book, the fact that the narrator herself is unnamed throughout. But, more importantly, this thriller is an exploration of power, of the men who have it and the women who don’t, and the secrets told to preserve it.• Second Life by SJ Watson is published by Black Swan.To my mind this is the best crime novel written in the English language. Lehane describes horrible events with poetic lines that somehow heal the injury that his subject matter involves, not unlike Shakespeare or the creators of the King James Old Testament. That’s not a hyper-bolic statement. His use of metaphysical imagery is obviously influenced by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Mystic River is one for the ages.• Robicheaux by James Lee Burke is published by Orion.Today, Hughes is remembered for In a Lonely Place (1947) – Bogart starred in the 1950 film version. My personal favourite is The Expendable Man (1963). Hughes lived in New Mexico and her love of its bleak landscape comes through in carefully painted details. She knows how to use the land sparingly, so it creates mood. The narrative shifts from the sandscape to the doctor, who reluctantly picks up a teen hitchhiker. When she’s found dead a day later, he’s the chief suspect, and the secrets we know he’s harbouring from the first page are slowly revealed.Hughes’s novels crackle with menace. Like a Bauhaus devotee, she understood that in creating suspense, less is more. Insinuation, not graphic detail, gives her books an edge of true terror. She’s the master we all could learn from.• Fallout by Sara Paretsky is published by Hodder.What is it about any particular novel that means you’re so engrossed that you miss your bus stop or stay up way past your bedtime? A spare, concise style that doesn’t waste a word. A striking lead character who manages to be both traditional and original. A plot that’s put together like a Swiss watch. Child’s debut has all these things, but like all great crime novels it has the x-factor.In the case of Killing Floor that factor is a righteous anger, rooted in personal experience, that makes the book shake in your hands. It’s the story of a military policeman who loses his job and gets kicked to the kerb. Jack Reacher becomes a Clint Eastwood-style loner who rides into town and makes it his business to dish out justice and protect the underdog, but without the usual props of cynicism or alcohol. We can all identify with that anger and with that thirst for justice. We don’t see much of the latter in real life. At least in Killing Floor we do.• Blood Daughter by Dreda Say Mitchell is published by Hodder.The Long Goodbye is not the most polished, and certainly not the most convincingly plotted, of Chandler’s novels, but it is the most heartfelt. This may seem an odd epithet to apply to one of the great practitioners of “hard-boiled” crime fiction. The fact is, Chandler was not hard-boiled at all, but a late romantic artist exquisitely attuned to the bittersweet melancholy of post-Depression America. His closest literary cousin is F Scott Fitzgerald.Philip Marlowe’s love – and surely it is nothing less than love – for the disreputable Terry Lennox is the core of the book, the rhapsodic theme that transcends and redeems the creaky storyline and the somewhat cliched characterisation. And if Lennox is a variant of Jay Gatsby, and Marlowe a stand in for Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald’s self-effacing but ever-present narrator, then Roger Wade, the drink-soaked churner-out of potboilers that he despises, is an all too recognisable portrait of Chandler himself, and a vengefully caricatured one at that. However, be assured that any pot The Long Goodbye might boil is fashioned from hammered bronze.• Prague Nights by Benjamin Black is published by Viking.Although Nicolas Freeling wrote in English he was a European by choice – an itinerant chef who roamed between postwar France, Belgium and Holland, and who instilled in me a passion for crime set in foreign places. He detested the rules of the traditional British detective novel: stories in which plot seemed to be paramount. Love in Amsterdam (1962) is Freeling’s first novel and it breaks those rules both in terms of structure and of theme.It is a tale of sexual obsession and much of the book is a conversation between the suspect, Martin, who’s been accused of killing his former lover, and the cop. Van der Valk, Freeling’s detective, is a rule-breaker too, curious and compassionate, and although we see his investigative skills in later books, here his interrogation is almost that of a psychologist, teasing the truth from Martin, forcing him to confront his destructive relationship with the victim.• The Seagull by Ann Cleeves is published by Pan.I first read Laidlaw in 1990, shortly after moving to London, when I was aching for something with the flavour of home, and what a gamey, pungent flavour McIlvanney’s novel served up. A sense of place is crucial to crime fiction, and Laidlaw brought Glasgow to life more viscerally than any book I had read before: the good and the bad, the language and the humour, the violence and the drinking.Laidlaw’s turf is a male hierarchy ruled by unwritten codes of honour, a milieu of pubs and hard men rendered so convincingly by McIlvanney’s taut prose. “His face looked like an argument you couldn’t win,” he writes of one character, encapsulating not only the man’s appearance but his entire biography in a mere nine words.This book made me realise that pacey, streetwise thrillers didn’t have to be American: we had mean streets enough of our own. It emboldened me to write about the places I knew and in my own accent.I’m going to claim Lolita for crime fiction, something I never used to do. But it has kidnapping, murder and – it’s important to use this term – rape. It also has multiple allusions to Edgar Allan Poe and even hides an important clue – well, not exactly in plain sight, but in the text of, yes, a purloined letter. And now we know, thanks to the dogged scholarship of Sarah Weinman, that it was based on a real case in the United States. (Weinman’s book, The Real Lolita, will be published later this year.)Dorothy Parker meant well when she said Lolita was a book about love, but, no – it’s about the rape of a child by a solipsistic paedophile who rationalises his actions, another crime that is too often hidden in plain sight. Some think that calling Lolita a crime novel cheapens it, but I think it elevates the book, reminds us of the pedestrian ugliness that is always there, thrumming beneath the beautiful language.• Sunburn by Laura Lippman is published by Faber.Ross Macdonald, an American who wrote in the 60s and 70s, has enchanted me since then with the beauty of his writing and the decency of his protagonist, Lew Archer. I envy him his prose: easy, elegant, at times poetically beautiful. I also admire the absence of violence in the novels, for he usually follows Aristotle’s admonition that gore be kept out of the view of the audience. When Archer discovers the various wicked things one person has done to another, he does not linger in describing it but makes it clear how his protagonist mourns not only the loss of human life but also the loss of humanity that leads to it.Macdonald’s plotting is elegant: often, as Archer searches for the motive for today’s crime, he unearths a past injustice that has returned to haunt the present and provoke its violence. His sympathy for the victims is endless, as is his empathy for some of the killers. • The Temptation of Forgiveness by Donna Leon is published by William Heinemann.With The Woman in White (1859-60) and The Moonstone (1868), Wilkie Collins basically invented the thriller form. The first features a woman wandering out of the fog,madness, stolen identity, one of the great villains – Fosco, corpulent, witty, with pet mice in his pockets – and a strong, unfeminine heroine with a moustache. The Moonstone has a world weary detective, an apparently unsolvable crime and a story told from multiple points of view. Pedants might point out that Poe was a co-inventor (and an earlier one).They might also point out that after an extraordinary psychological duel between Marian Halcombe and Fosco in the first half of the book, Collins almost seems to lose interest. And that the solution in The Moonstone is an outrageous cheat. No matter. Those of us writing in the form are still in his debt – and we’re still reading and rereading his uncanny and glorious books.• Sunday Morning Coming Down by Nicci French is published by Penguin.The trouble with a classic, especially one as frequently adapted as this, is you can lose sight of the original. And yet, looming over the Cumberbatches and Rathbones, there lives my own personal Sherlock Holmes, the one who took shape when I read the story as a schoolboy. No matter how many film or TV versions I come across, none can match the thrill of that first encounter.And there’s a reason why producers and directors keep returning to Baskerville Hall. The book is a perfectly executed crime story: red herrings dropped in just the right places, a location full of mist and menace, a tangle of family secrets, the murderer’s apparently ingenious plan and, at the centre, an enigmatic, eccentric and brilliant detective. It is a recipe for pleasure that made me gasp as a child – and it’s never stopped working.• To Kill the President by Sam Bourne is published by HarperCollins.Summer 1976: student Adam inherits an isolated Suffolk house from a distant uncle. The bohemian commune he dreams of goes horribly wrong. Ten years later, the bodies of a woman and child are discovered in the hall’s animal cemetery. But which woman? Whose child?Rendell was best known for her Chief Inspector Wexford procedural novels but it’s the standalone psychological thrillers she wrote as Barbara Vine that have me by the heart. A Fatal Inversion is arguably the definitive Vine: set partly in the past, substantial in theme and language as well as length. Not a classic whodunit but who-was-it-done-to, ingeniously plotted using flashback and switching viewpoints to constantly wrong-foot the reader.It is a murder investigation, but seen from the suspects’ viewpoint rather than the detective’s. This is the kind of crime I like to read (and write). This book has it all murder, suspense, sex, property porn and a last-page twist that still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.What set Rendell apart was an underpinning of perfect psychological plausibility. She understood better than anyone I’ve ever read how petty obsession can spiral into violence. Rendell dealt in Middle England rather than the marginalised, with loss of control rather than premeditation. The violence is sparing and all the more chilling for it, letting readers’ imaginations do the real dirty work.• He SaidShe Said by Erin Kelly is published by Hodder.It was a tragedy when Kerr, one of my heroes, passed away earlier this year. He was a prodigious talent, but he’ll be best remembered for his fantastic antihero, Bernie Gunther, an investigator in Nazi Germany and in the postwar period. I love novels with an ambiguous, conflicted protagonist and, for me, Gunther is the gold standard. My favourite is A Quiet Flame, in which Bernie finds himself in Argentina, alongside a bunch of unsavoury characters including Adolf Eichmann. Bernie is tasked with hunting down a serial killer targeting young girls in a method very similar to another crime he investigated back in Berlin.• A Necessary Evil by Abir Mukherjee is published by Vintage.It’s slightly cheating, choosing Ripley, because he comes with five novels, not one, and they are all equally gripping, tantalising and psychologically fascinating. Across the Ripliad, our hero matures – his weird, glinting, almost masochistic relationship with guilt twists and mutates – but it is in The Talented Mr Ripley that he first crosses the Rubicon from conman to psychopath. Ripley, having befriended and then taken on the identity of rich, idle Dickie, ducks and es across Italy, using his wits to outrun the consequences of his actions and the devil of his own nature. Highsmith’s writing is deceptively simple – as when a smile is “deliberately hurled” across a table. But it’s her understanding of psychology that makes the novel so great. Like all the best confidence tricksters, Ripley reads people, each nervous twitch, each self-regarding simper, using every moment of weakness for his own gain. Highsmith does the same with the reader. She draws in your sympathies (Ripley’s right, isn’t he? How aloof and superior this character is), so that when the bludgeon comes out, half a page later, you are somehow complicit in the crime. Chilling perfection.• Take Me In by Sabine Durrant is out from Mulholland in June.Crime and Punishment is kingpin of the crime fiction prison yard. It’s a teeming, Rabelaisian sprawl, but from the moment Raskolnikov leaves his garret and sets off towards the Kokushkin Bridge it grabs the reader by the lapels. The murder scene, when it comes, is at once farcical, horrifying and enthralling. Raskolnikov is by turns irascible, compassionate, mean-spirited and astute. He infuriates, and commits heinous crimes, but Dostoevsky still contrives to make us root for him.Of course, it is no whodunnit. Instead, in common with much of the greatest crime fiction, its fascination lies in the exploration of the machinations of the mind of a killer – it’s concerned with the psychological impact of the crime rather than the unravelling of a mystery. The big questions it asks are those of guilt, free will and redemption and it’s this ambition that makes it not only the greatest crime novel, but perhaps the greatest of all novels.• The Accident on the A35 by Graeme Macrae Burnet is published by Contraband.This book is as close to perfection as I’ve come across. Structurally it’s extremely tightly woven and as psychological suspense, it pretty much has everything. Remote rural community harbouring secrets? Check. Dual time narrative – the original crime investigation of 1963 and current day? Check. Intrepid female lead, uncovering the truth? Check. Killer twist? Check. Ruth Rendell agreed it was “one of the best detective stories I’ve read”.I read it a long time ago, before I became a crime writer myself, yet when I think about it now, it seems more like a classic novel than a contemporary one. What stays in the mind is the Peak District community of Scarsdale, the investigator as outsider trying to permeate its secrets. And the sheer quality of the writing.• Persons Unknown by Susie Steiner is published by Borough.Seamlessly blending piercing psychological drama, solid procedural and geopolitical thriller plotting, le Carré tells his tales in a breathtaking style he manages to make both muscular and elegant. A Perfect Spy is perhaps the best fictional examination of a father-son relationship penned to date. And his dissection of American foreign policy (in any number of his works) should be required reading in the US state department.• The Burial Hour by Jeffery Deaver is published by Hodder.It was Cruz Smith’s Arkady Renko series that showed me the possibilities of “voice” and “character attitude” in crime writing and how those two elements can be brought together to create a truly memorable novel. In Gorky Park we are navigating the edgy, fractious world of cold war Moscow. There is something wonderfully distinctive about the Russian detective’s way of being and seeing. I am struck by the precision and insight in his interactions with others and himself and that honed cynicism that is never moralistic or judgmental. As Michael Connelly pointed out, “a crime novel – like any story – succeeds or fails on the basis of character”. Renko confirms this for me every time. It is an incredible feat of character portrayal.• The Bone Readers by Jacob Ross is published by Peepal Tree.Jar City was the first Icelandic crime novel to become a critical and commercial success. Published in Icelandic in 2001 (and translated into English by Bernard Scudder in 2006), Silence of the Grave is the second in the series, and proved Arnaldur Indriðason to be one of the world’s finest contemporary crime fiction writers. The book centres on the investigation into the origins of a skeleton found at a building site. This is intriguing enough to keep one glued to the pages, as is the flawed yet endearing protagonist, the policeman Erlendur. But it is a second storyline – which revolves around domestic abuse and its effect on the family involved – that really elevates the novel. It is heart wrenching, agonisingly disturbing and so utterly convincing that one feels present in this horrible household. • The Reckoning by Yrsa Sigurðardóttir is out from Hodder in May.An amoral drifter arrives at a truck stop looking for food or work and meets his soulmate, the wife of the cafe owner. The sultry self-loathing of the protagonist is mirrored by the woman and they begin a cruel, careless affair and devise a plan to murder her husband. The staccato first person delivery gives the book a thrilling, urgent tone. Neither of the central characters is given a back story and their motives are base. So far, so pulp noir, but Cain does something extraordinary within that. They are redeemed by their loyalty to each other. It takes an hour to read but you’ll never forget it •• The Long Drop by Denise Mina is published by Vintage.This is the high-water mark of the genre, for me. Martin Cruz Smith took a familiar trope – a good man trying to keep his head down and do his job, despite the corruption all around him – and made something entirely fresh, entirely new. What begins as a murder mystery becomes a cold war thriller unlike any that preceded it, and if the label “game-changer” had existed back in the 80s, here it would have found its perfect fit. Gorky Park is perhaps the most humane thriller I’ve ever read, offering a fascinating glimpse of a society in slow-motion collapse, and its thrills never pall with rereading every time the snow starts to melt, revealing those three corpses within earshot of the skating rink, I’m hooked again. The key to its success is its hero, Arkady Renko: brave, lonely and utterly sympathetic. “He’s a good instrument. I work better when I’m working with him,” Smith once said. We could all use such tools.• London Rules by Nick Herron is out from John Murray in August.• The Theakston Old Peculier crime writing festival, with Lee Child as programming chair, is at The Old Swan, Harrogate, 19-22 July. harrogateinternationalfestivals.  • To browse all the books featured in this article, please visit bookshop.

A recovery began that has continued uninterrupted ever since. At the end of this month, the US will have enjoyed its second-longest period of economic expansion in history, beating the upswing under John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson between 1961 and 1968.By next summer, if nothing untoward happens, Donald Trump will be able to boast that the US has beaten the record 10-year period of growth between the end of the Gulf war in 1991 and the 2001 dotcom bust. Expect a flurry of self-congratulatory tweets from the White House.The reasons for America’s recovery are simple. Interest rates were cut quickly and aggressively by the country’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, and kept at rock-bottom levels for seven years. The Fed also pumped trillions of dollars into the economy through the process known as quantitative easing – buying bonds to expand the money supply.Swift action was taken to clean up the financial system so that the banks could start lending again. Obama announced a modest package of tax cuts and spending increases. Lessons were learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when demand was sucked out of an already weak economy and banks were allowed to fail.Taken together, the measures got the US slowly moving again. It helped that the authorities in Beijing were simultaneously using even more aggressive measures – big infrastructure projects and expansion of credit – to stimulate the Chinese economy.Dario Perkins, managing director of global macroeconomics at the research company TS Lombard, says the US is not alone in having experienced a long period of growth. “Among the developed economies, Australia, Sweden, Germany and Canada all have expansions that match or surpass the US achievement. And if we extend the analysis to the emerging economies, we find several countries with even more impressive\u0026nbspperformances.”Europe, which suffered a double-dip recession and only began a sustained pick-up in 2013, is the one part of the world where the recovery looks relatively immature, Perkins says.All upturns come to an end sooner or later and the fact that it is now almost nine years since the US emerged from recession has inevitably led to speculation about when and how the next downturn will arrive.The International Monetary Fund is worried by Trump’s protectionist rhetoric, with its chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, warning at its spring meeting earlier this month that there was a risk of the global trading system being torn apart.Keith Wade, chief economist and strategist at the investment firm Schroders, believes Trump is trying to extract concessions from China before the US midterm elections this November rather than seeking to start a trade war.Nor does he think there is a high probability of the US being derailed by a hard landing for the Chinese economy caused by the collapse of its credit bubble.That leaves two remaining triggers. Perkins says that there are only scattered signs of the trends that normally develop in the late stages of an economic cycle – firms running up against capacity constraints, rising inflation and excessive investment. More likely, he thinks, the end will come – as it did in both 2001 and 2007 – with the popping of an asset-price bubble. “Recent history suggests any problems are more likely to start in the financial sector and with central banks tightening policy and asset prices high by historical standards, this is surely the area to watch over the next 12 to 18 months.”The 1960s upswing eventually came to an end when the economy ran into inflationary problems amplified by the cost of the war in Vietnam and Johnson’s Great Society welfare programmes. Dean Baker, from the left-leaning Centre for Economic Policy Research in Washington, says there is no real evidence that the US economy is reaching its supply limits and that the concerns expressed over the impact of Trump’s tax cuts for the budget deficit are overblown.But the Fed might see it differently. Wade says the US central bank has a tricky task in raising interest rates without triggering a sharp downturn and that its dilemma is made worse by the fading impact of the fiscal boost after 2019.The good news for Trump, he says, is that the record for continuous economic expansion will be broken next year. The bad news is that the “festivities in the White House might be somewhat muted as the president faces the prospect of fighting for re-election during a recession”.It’s clear that the US recovery since 2008 is among the most consistent and sustained, compared with its predecessors. But to say it is lacklustre is to underplay how weak it is, especially when the extra efforts of the government and the central bank are considered. The rapid expansion in the early 1960s during the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies was by far the strongest, followed by the boom under Ronald Reagan, which ended in recession before the recovery credited to Bill Clinton in the 1990s.US wages have waxed and waned during each of the postwar recoveries except for the most recent one, which has seen wage rises remain low for almost the entire period. It was expected that tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google would spur a turnaround that filtered down to the rest of the economy. However, Amazon and Google, as in the UK, have played a bigger role in boosting transport for their goods and the low-grade jobs that go with the sector, than high-paying engineering jobs in the IT business. Economist Robert J Shapiro says automation in the internet age has been one of the biggest factors depressing wages.Phillip Inman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2916b60b1691662001fd3ce544f9e7401ad5cea9/0_241_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4286910e69faf66eab36c524a1d069b9","title":"bank raise interest rates time long since come gone","story":"With little more than a week to go before the Bank of England considers its next interest rate move, it has become clear that the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has missed the\u0026nbspboat. Its governor, Mark Carney, hinted as much in comments earlier this month when he spoke about the weakening of the economy since the start of the year.“I don’t want to get too focused on the precise timing – it is more about the general path,” Carney told the BBC. In particular, he said the turmoil on Britain’s high streets, which has seen a worrying number of businesses go to the wall, was a matter of interest to the bank’s interest-rate-setting committee.Carney’s gloomy stance is in sharp contrast with his bullish comments in February. Back then, he was keen to follow the US Federal Reserve and signal several increases to head off what he saw as a booming economy that was feeding rapidly into higher wages.In the simplest of monetary policy calculations, higher wages mean demand outstripping supply for goods and services, which in turn leads to rising prices. Carney said that with wages set to soar and inflation to remain stubbornly high, calm could only be restored by jacking up interest rates.But persistently high inflation perpetuated by strong wage rises was always a mirage shimmering on the horizon. It was never going to happen – at least not in the sustained fashion that might worry a central bank.The inflation rise seen in Britain was always a temporary blip driven by the fall in the pound, which provided a one-off rise in import prices. It was prolonged by an unexpected rise in the oil price to $70 a barrel.So the question must be, why did Carney and his rate-setting committee make such a big deal of the need to raise rates when the case was always weak?Carney was one of the chief naysayers, arguing that the economy remained weak by historical standards and, crucially, that low productivity was restricting the possibility of high and sustained wage rises. Looking back, 2014 and 2015 were high points in a long struggle for\u0026nbsprecovery.Is Carney kicking himself for inaction now that there is an even weaker case for re-arming monetary policy? He shouldn’t be. The responsibility for acting always lay with the government, and particularly George Osborne’s Treasury. All the time Osborne was promising more austerity, the Bank’s hands were tied. While the Treasury was withdrawing money from the economy by spending less – and businesses, nervous about the future, were doing the same – it was a suicide mission for the Bank to pursue a similar goal. It was only the Bank that stood between the UK and a full-blown, 1930s-style depression.It is still possible the Bank of England will raise rates in a bloody-minded show of strength. Yet by its own standards, the case for it could only have been made three years ago. Now it’s much too late. Austerity remains firmly in place. The current chancellor, Philip Hammond, worries about Brexit and business follows suit – limiting investment and wages growth, and leaving hard-pressed households to survive as best they can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b0847b5f0ce18828c8279b52adcb5f4edc09b8/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c8e3a427bcc4e4fd1080daa3ac2f50","title":"sainsburys and asda in shock talks over 10bn merger deal","story":"Sainsbury’s and Asda are in talks over a £10bn merger that would send shockwaves through the high street by creating a retailer more powerful than the current market leader, Tesco.A tie-up between the UK’s second- and third-largest supermarket chains would create a new group with huge shares of the market in food, clothing, household goods and toy retailing. Sainsbury’s already owns Argos while Asda’s George clothing brand vies with Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Primark to sell the most clothing in volume terms. The enlarged supermarket group would have nearly 3,000 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn.Any proposed deal is likely to be closely scrutinised by the competition watchdog over concerns it would tighten the grip the four major supermarket chains – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – have on the UK grocery market. Analysts also suggest the combination could lead to thousands of job losses as the two chains cut out duplication. The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs. They are trying to rebuild their profits, which have collapsed as the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl have stolen shoppers, while online players led by Amazon have sucked sales out of the high street.Mike Coupe, the chief executive of London-based Sainsbury’s, is said to be in the driving seat, making the future of Asda’s Leeds head office look uncertain. A combination of the two groups would be expected to strip out costs by consolidating back-office operations. Asda is run by a former Sainsbury’s executive, Roger Burnley, who quit the group for a more senior role at the rival in 2015.Sainsbury’s confirmed it was in talks with the US retail giant Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999. “Sainsbury’s confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury’s and Asda businesses,” the company said in statement rushed out on Saturday afternoon after Sky News and the newswire Bloomberg both reported the story. Sainsbury’s promised to provide more details to the stock exchange on Monday morning.It has previously been unthinkable that there would be consolidation among the UK’s big four supermarkets because of competition concerns, but the retailers are said to have been emboldened after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) waved through the merger of Tesco and Booker, the UK’s biggest retailer and grocery wholesaler respectively.The deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the retail sector as Aldi and Lidl become increasingly powerful and the cost of running high street stores increases because of higher business rates and labour costs. Sainsbury’s is also looking for ways to shore up its market position in the wake of Tesco’s recent takeover of Booker. That deal increased Tesco’s buying power by creating a food group with sales of £57.5bn.Sainsbury’s has a network of more than 1,400 supermarkets and convenience stores while Asda has around 600 stores. Sainsbury’s also has 800 Argos outlets.“It’s hard to see this being good for consumers,” said Scott Corfe, the chief economist at the Social Market Foundation thinktank. “Recent experience, with the rise of Aldi and Lidl triggering a supermarket price war, supports the case for a less concentrated groceries sector - not a more concentrated one.”It is unclear how the deal between Sainsbury’s and Asda might be structured. Sainsbury’s is listed in London and it is understood US-listed Walmart intends to retain a large shareholding in the enlarged group. Further clarity is expected on Monday. The Usdaw union’s national officer, Joanne McGuinness, said it would be seeking urgent meetings with the businesses to get more detail on what a merger would involve. “Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes,” she said.If the merger happens it would be biggest shake-up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004. Analysts debated the merits of the proposed deal on social media, with many convinced competition concerns would force the companies to sell off a large number of stores.Bryan Roberts, a TCC Global analyst, also questioned the logic of the deal. “I don’t see what problems this solves. They will still be unable to be cheaper than Aldi and Lidl because they have a unique operating model. I was also expect that there would need to be a chunky disposal programme once the CMA has looked at local competition issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298f03d69c3a8896648cbf7583103552ebfe6342/107_160_5134_3081/master/5134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92c846e908f69bcfe052524a22865e5c","title":"waterstones paul singer elliott secretive wizard","story":"A Republican billionaire hedge fund manager attacked by the former president of Argentina as a “financial terrorist” and “vulture lord” has just bought your local bookshop.Elliott Advisors, the UK ision of the $34bn (£25bn) activist hedge fund, Elliott Management, run by controversial New Yorker Paul Singer, last week bought Waterstones from Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut in a secretive deal thought to have valued the bookshop chain at more than £200m.It’s small change for Singer, 73, who has amassed a $2.9bn personal fortune according to Forbes. But it’s the latest in a string of deals his fund has made in the UK, where his son Gordon runs Elliott Advisors.Elliott, the world’s largest activist hedge fund, has sued Tesco over the 2014 accounting scandal and fought a very public battle with the management of coach and train operator National Express.Last month – after rapidly building a big stake in takeover target GKN – it threw its weight behind bidder Melrose, helping the business branded an asset stripper win the battle for control of the industrial giant. GKN’s then boss, Anne Stevens, said shareholders like Elliott did not “give a crap” about the best long-term\u0026nbspoutcomes.The firm’s renewed interest in British companies should allow Singer to indulge in one of his greatest passions: Arsenal FC. He is a regular at his local sports bar on New York’s exclusive Upper West Side when Arsenal are playing, and has been spotted in the crowd at the Emirates stadium with his son Gordon.Singer is also an accomplished pianist and has been known to perform with one son on guitar, the other on drums and his son-in-law on saxophone. On one occasion he rocked out with Meat Loaf at a party.But it is his aggressive attitude to business for which Singer is equally feared and respected. His hedge fund, which he started in 1977 with $1.3m raised from friends and family, has been involved in many of the most high-profile and bruising corporate and political battles of recent years.His strategy of buying up struggling countries’ debts in order to sell them on for big profits or sue governments to demand full repayment led to Elliott being repeatedly labelled a “vulture fund”, a term Singer is known to despise.He spent $20m in 1995 on defaulted debt from Peru, and then successfully sued for $58m. He acquired at a discounted price a $30m debt owed by Congo-Brazzaville, and in 2002 and 2003 won more than $100m in\u0026nbspinterest.He chased Argentina for debts for more than decade, including tracking the course of a Argentine navy ship, Libertad. When it arrived in Ghana, he persuaded one of the country’s judges to detain the vessel in port until he was paid the millions owed to him. Argentina won that round, successfully arguing in the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea that the ship should be released. But he won a later court battle resulting in the South American country defaulting on its debts.The former president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, memorably described Singer as “the Vulture Lord”, a “bloodsucker” and a “financial terrorist”.Singer guards his privacy fiercely and has given very few interviews, but the Financial Times reported that when a journalist from Euromoney magazine asked if legal skirmishes were fun, he was met with a look of incomprehension and astonishment. “Fun? Skiing is fun. This is work.”In a rare deliberate step into the spotlight, he corralled other hedge fund managers to join him in financially backing the 2011 vote to legalise gay marriage in New York state. The money, an estimated $10m of which Singer personally pledged, was said to have swung the vote.It was personal for Singer, as his younger son Andrew, a New York doctor, is gay and could not marry in the state, so instead married his husband in Massachusetts in 2009.“It was something that was beyond my understanding at the time,” Singer said of his son’s coming out during a debate on gay rights at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014. “After a series of mutually supportive conversations, I became very educated about gender and sexuality, and I became very enthusiastic about his efforts to stop discrimination.”Singer is a big donor to the Republican party, but funded the “Never Trump” movement before the 2016 election. But ever the pragmatist, since the election Singer has met Trump in the White House.After one visit Trump declared that Singer “was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, ‘Never Trump,’ and Paul just left, and he’s given us his total support and it’s all about unification.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6689f6891154f1b0578be8646f260c2e7bb5c8d9/0_107_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0360e9995e66fe698cc12dc38a3d799a","title":"never have words meant so little for a generation of politicians amber rudd","story":"We live in a time when words have never meant less and cynicism has never been more widely accepted. Did I say “accepted”? That is too weak. The embrace of dishonesty is so clammy, politicians react with astonishment when naive citizens demonstrate their bad taste by supposing that they are somehow accountable for their actions.In near identical language, Amber Rudd said she was “surprised” that the Tories’ “hostile environment” for migrants had led to the state persecution of the innocent. Her contemporary Emily Thornberry was not just “surprised”, she was “really shocked” that racists were thanking her for the fine job she and her colleagues in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party were doing in baiting Jews.The personal is no longer political. In private, Thornberry and Rudd are forceful, friendly, intelligent and liberal. To use a phrase that falls from our lips too easily, they “don’t have a racist bone in their bodies” and appear genuinely outraged when their critics assume they are built with little else. They don’t understand that racist bones are neither here nor there when what they lack are backbones.After Ukip terrified the established parties, politicians on the make resolved to show their hostility to migrants. Rudd made the smart move of closing her eyes and blocking her ears as British citizens complained that the state was forcing them to produce documentation going back decades to rent a home, open a bank account, go to a doctor or hold on to a job.What did you expect her to do? Challenge the prime minister and take on the Tory backbenches and Tory press by creating a “just environment” for migrants? Come now. Conventional wisdom holds we should nod along and realise she had no choice. Not because Rudd is wicked, but because no one on the right can be liberal on immigration in the 2010s. It’s not personal, just political.As with Ukip, so with the Corbyn insurgency. Thornberry does not get on in his Labour party by showing solidarity with abused Jewish colleagues. She gets on by pleasing Vladimir Putin’s propagandists and announcing in defiance of all evidence that the United Nations, not Russia, was stopping chemical weapons inspectors investigating the gassing of civilians by the Kremlin’s Syrian ally. Once again we are meant to shrug. Wake up and smell the bitter coffee. This is how an ambitious Labour politician must behave if they want to appeal to Len McCluskey and all Labour’s cranks and conspiracists who will have their say when the next leadership contest comes.Rudd and Thornberry are mere appetisers. No historian can find a precedent for today’s parliament where the prime minister and most of the government and opposition benches will consciously vote for a policy they know will make the nation poorer. So complete is their abandonment of any conception of political integrity that they cannot tell the truth about the choices they are making as they push to leave the single market. They will not level with the public and say suffering is the price of a hard Brexit. In the words of the anti-Brexit campaigner Hugo Dixon, it would be an “electrifying moment” if Theresa May or any one of her ministers merely gave a plain account of the country’s future.If it’s not a constant of human nature to damn the present and romanticise the past, it’s certainly a constant of journalism. Hans Rosling and Steven Pinker have written with penetration on how, with the ominous exceptions of the environment and the human race’s mass extinction of species, life is becoming better. Whether you measure global poverty, access to healthcare, sexual equality, the experience of war and violence or life expectancy, the present is preferable to the recent past – overwhelmingly so.It sounds like mere nostalgia to unleash a heartrending “O tempora! O mores!” and lament our ill luck to have fallen under the rule of a uniquely cynical generation of politicians. Few have ever got to the top of politics or any other hierarchical system without compromising their integrity, after all. What’s new? To my mind, there are two solid reasons for thinking the British at least are in a new and worse place .The first is the difference in scale between the spin of the Hillary ClintonDavid CameronNick Clegg generation of politicians and bombast of today’s leaders. The Leave campaign won with barefaced lies: that Britain paid £350m a week to Brussels and Turkey was about to join the EU and send an invasion force of millions of (Muslim) migrants our way. Trump won by convincing tens of millions of Americans that the truth about him was fake news.There are many honourable political exceptions and we can only hope they will be steeled by today’s battles and provide the leaders of the future. But when all the caveats are made, we are still left with politicians who have learned that the more vehemently they deny, the more they succeed the greater the lie, the greater the reward.Then there is a difference in the stakes, which could not be higher. The Tories may not end up as a nationalist party, which appeals only to whites. Labour may not end up as the natural home for creeps. But in both instances the fight is on and the outcome uncertain. Beyond them lies Brexit, the greatest issue since the Second World War. I suppose it is asking too much to expect Conservative and Labour leaders to adopt a Churchillian pose and promise “blood, toil, tears and sweat”. But their inability to acknowledge the pain ahead for the most vulnerable people and most depressed regions is to use the word in its proper context for once more than a surprise. It is “shocking”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5afe21e5ae65ddcf912ae9cde1a2bbf03046bb98/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53761b8ba0607953ac9cc5178a88306a 1320w","title":"crystal palace leicester city premier league match report","story":"The majority in this stadium broke away from celebrating their team’s flurry of late goals to serenade Roy Hodgson as full-time approached, the Crystal Palace manager responding with a wave from his dug-out. The south London club may not be arithmetically assured of survival but this was surely the riotous victory which extended their stay in the Premier League into a sixth campaign. He deserved his moment.To have in effect guaranteed their status before the end of April is remarkable. Rewind to September and the side had languished pointless and goalless at the foot of the table after seven games, Frank de Boer’s tenure having already been curtailed with the dust still to settle on the summer transfer window. Hodgson had come in as a firefighter. He has since steered the side to 38 points with two games to go without a goalscoring centre-forward, a crippling injury list and with no significant additions in January.The smile of satisfaction which creased across the manager’s face on the final whistle said it all, relief giving way to unbridled delight as he clapped hands with his assistant, Ray Lewington, and the locals celebrated their most emphatic win in Premier League history. Hodgson has done what he does best: diligent coaching allied with logical team selection, with players revelling in the positions they know best. Common sense and industry have led the way, with Wilfried Zaha the free spirit in amid the industry.He is the player who can set this collective apart. Leicester were unable to deal with the Ivorian’s trickery and slippery running, particularly once they had been reduced to 10 men after Marc Albrighton had brought down the forward. It had been his first-time finish beyond Ben Hamer which set the tone, Palace having shifted the ball wonderfully in-field, from Ruben Loftus-Cheek to Yohan Cabaye to James McArthur’s back-heel, while City dithered.This was actually a triumph for the collective. Loftus-Cheek was excellent in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, capping his own display by collecting Mamadou Sakho’s pass to round Hamer and tap into a gaping net. Cabaye and McArthur were excellent, while Andros Townsend was irrepressible. James Tomkins saw a header scrambled from the goalline by Kelechi Iheanacho.Leicester were slack in midfield throughout, blunted further by a hamstring injury to Wilfred Ndidi and Albrighton’s dismissal. They have won only twice in 11 league games and Puel is under pressure. “It’s not my concern at this moment,” said the Frenchman. “My first feeling is to stay near my players and get a good response in the next game.” He had mumbled his assessment of the game with three mentions of “catastrophe”, which neatly summed it up.Patrick van Aanholt belted in a fourth after Hamer had blocked from Jeffrey Schlupp, though Palace saved their most celebratory goal until last. Christian Benteke had not scored in this arena since last May. Yet Harry Maguire tripped the Belgian in stoppage time and Luka Milivojevic, having taken counsel from the bench, insisted the striker took the spot-kick.It was a role reversal from the late farce against Bournemouth in December, when Benteke had ripped the ball from the regular penalty taker but failed to convert. Here he slipped as he connected but the ball was struck truly enough. Once he had emerged from the joyous clutter of team-mates, Palace had risen to 11th. “Miracles do happen but basically we are safe,” added Hodgson. The din at the final whistle sounded survival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6883dd071f88611b074070160a6e49493623912/204_455_3013_1808/master/3013.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9093867022ffe85aaeb60fbcead992a6","title":"southampton bournemouth premier league match report","story":"Perhaps Southampton’s race is not yet run. Mark Hughes earned his first victory as their manager as his team picked up their sixth league win of the season – and their first since February – to hoist themselves closer to safety. Two goals from Dusan Tadic over neighbours Bournemouth was enough to keep what was a sinking ship in with a chance of staying afloat. Their fate may be in their own hands by the time they travel to fellow strugglers Swansea in their penultimate match in the final week of the season.Whether this result provides sufficient impetus to ensure Saints’ top-flight survival, with three games to play, remains to be seen, but a rousing standing ovation at the final whistle from almost all quarters of St\u0026nbspMary’s spoke volumes. Tadic labelled it as one of Southampton’s most important wins in their history.“I think everybody understood the significance of the result for us,” said Hughes, who was appointed in March. “The order of the day was to get those maximum three points and it was a rollercoaster but everybody stuck at it.“Clearly, at times there is a little bit of apprehension and anxiety in our play. Hopefully, now we’ve got those points on the board the shackles will loosen.”The magnitude of this game meant Southampton and Bournemouth have never met with more at stake. Hughes described it as a “black and white” matter given that victory here was a necessity for his side, who travel to Everton on Saturday.Tadic’s goals, either side of a Joshua King strike, have finally injected life into Southampton’s faltering season and could yet define a late escape.“You saw the reaction at the end of the game – it was huge for everybody,” Hughes said. “It’s not an easy situation and we are all conscious of the responsibilities we have. Maybe in the past the players have been questioned in terms of recognising what this situation is but I thought they were first-class. We will see if we can get over the line and we still have a lot to do in fairness.”It was never going to be a nerveless occasion and Eddie Howe’s attacking side seized the initiative, with Lys Mousset’s low cross flummoxing Jan Bednarek, the Southampton defender freezing in the penalty area before conceding a corner.Bournemouth were at ease, typified by Mousset’s nutmeg on Oriol Romeu and Nathan Aké’s show of strength when faced with Tadic on the touchline. But their comfort also allowed Saints in to twice prosper, much to Howe’s frustration. “We made too many bad decisions and that was probably epitomised by the two goals,” the Bournemouth manager said. “The game was there for us to exert our influence but we were too wasteful.”The visitors were on the front foot when Southampton swarmed upfield in the 25th minute, Charlie Daniels, the last defender, isolated against Mario Lemina. The Saints midfielder galloped forward before teeing up Tadic to slot home into the corner beyond Asmir Begovic in the Bournemouth goal.The home joy did not last to half-time, however. First, Aké, after swivelling away from Maya Yoshida and Wesley Hoedt, was superbly denied by the outstretched left leg of the Southampton goalkeeper, Alex McCarthy, before King, lurking unmarked, stabbed home from the resulting corner.Southampton had been thrust back to square one. It could have been worse after the interval but McCarthy pulled off another fine save, this time from Lewis Cook’s swerving effort from distance.However, in the 54th minute, when Steve Cook, the Bournemouth defender, went to chest down a routine ball in the centre circle, Tadic nipped in to pick up the pieces. He edged closer and closer to goal as Bournemouth backed off before the invitation was too good to pass up, and he stepped inside to fire beyond Begovic.Austin’s cross-cum-shot was almost erted home by substitute Shane Long only for Begovic’s towering frame to intervene.Bournemouth and Howe responded. Jermain Defoe and Jordon Ibe were thrown on and the former was superbly thwarted by Hoedt’s sliding challenge late on with only McCarthy to beat. Austin then slammed an effort into the side-netting as the Saints toyed with their supporters’ nerves.Southampton looked set to seal the win, only for Simon Francis to nick the ball away from Lemina just as he readied himself to score into an empty net.Stuart Attwell, the fourth official, indicated five added minutes and only at full-time could Southampton finally toast the most priceless of results.Champions: Manchester CityEurope:\u0026nbspManchester United,\u0026nbspLiverpool and Tottenham are favourites for the top four with Chelsea\u0026nbspin fifth.

Cesc Fàbregas was the scorer, racking up 50 Premier League goals in style, yet it was the artistry from Eden Hazard that went before that caught the eye just as much as the Spaniard’s splendid finish.Swansea contributed to their own downfall in the build-up to that early goal by carelessly giving away possession inside their own half and although Carlos Carvalhal’s side finished the match strongly, they were unable to repair the damage as Chelsea collected a third successive away victory in the league to move within two points of Tottenham, who have a game in hand.For Swansea, the league table now makes for uncomfortable viewing. The four-point advantage they enjoyed over Southampton at the start of the day has been trimmed to just a point and momentum seems to have deserted them at a critical stage of the season. Although Carvalhal made the point afterwards that Swansea are in a far better position than when he was appointed in December, they have failed to win in six league matches and for long periods against Chelsea it was hard to see where a goal would come from.With three fixtures remaining their fate is still in their own hands and it promises to be quite an occasion on Tuesday week, when Southampton come to the Liberty Stadium. Stoke are then the visitors on the final day of the season and it now looks like this relegation battle will go right to the wire. “If we play like that today, I’m sure we’ll get the necessary points,” said Carvalhal, a little optimistically.As for Chelsea, this was not a vintage performance from them by any stretch but Antonio Conte’s side did just about enough to get over the line. It was not until the final 20 minutes when the champions started to come under any real pressure, after Carvalhal scrapped the three-man central defence that has become more of a hindrance than a help to a team that struggles to create chances, and even then Chelsea looked reasonably comfortable.The only real moment of concern for Chelsea was when Nathan Dyer tumbled to the ground in the Chelsea area following a robust challenge from Gary Cahill, who squared up to Jordan Ayew in the final seconds of the game after being unhappy with the Swansea forward’s shove on him from behind. Jon Moss, the referee, felt that Cahill got the ball cleanly when he tackled Dyer, although Carvalhal saw things differently. “He took the ball and Dyer together,” the Swansea manager said. “Outside the area it must be a foul, inside the area it must be a penalty.”Conte claimed not to have seen the penalty incident and was more interested in discussing Chelsea’s lack of conviction in front of goal. “I think this season we are not clinical,” he said. “In the last period we are winning but also playing a little bit where we could kill the game but instead the game was in the balance until the end.”Asked why that has been the case with Chelsea this season, Conte replied: “Our top scorer has scored only 12 goals, and if your best scorer has scored only 12 goals it means it is very difficult to fight for something this season, this is the reality – the stats speak very well.”Hazard is the man leading the way in the goalscoring charts for Chelsea and it was a wonderful bit of play from the Belgian that created the breakthrough here. Andy King, however, will rue the moment when he allowed a routine pass to slip under his foot deep inside the Swansea half, gifting Chelsea and N’Golo Kanté possession.Hazard, the best player on the pitch, then picked up the ball and pirouetted away from Ki Sung-yueng with a lovely turn, before driving forward to the edge of the area. All eyes were looking to Hazard’s left but instead he played an exquisite reverse pass in the opposite direction that bamboozled the Swansea defence and picked out Fabregas. What followed was just as impressive as the Spaniard, without breaking his stride, swept a glorious first-time left-footed shot that nestled in the top corner.Pedestrian in possession and hamstrung by a lack of width further forward, Swansea never really troubled Chelsea until that tactical shift and a couple of substitutions led to them attacking with more urgency and conviction. Andre Ayew and Tom Carroll both shot narrowly wide during that period, yet it still felt like a case of too little too late for a team that has a tense couple of weeks ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8df61fd076cce09069c40f1c8013e528006067a3/0_133_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a4332050359a759530983f3f871e0d","title":"swansea v chelsea premier league live","story":"Cesc Fabregas scored early as Chelsea kept up their Champions League chase and Swansea’s relegation fears deepened.Stuart James was at the Liberty, and here’s his report:And that’s your lot on a very good day for Chelsea and Southampton, not such a productive one for Swansea and Liverpool. Ta-ta!Antonio Conte speaks! “It was a good win. If we want to keep hope of a place in the Champions League, we have to win every game. Today, it wasn’t easy. They are fighting to avoid relegation, and in England every game you must be prepared to fight. We could have been more clinical and killed the game, but it can happen. The only way to put pressure on Tottenham was to win the game.”Carlos Carvahal speaks! “We played against a strong team. And we played them like a strong team. After putting more players in attack, we started to cause them problems. And we should have had a penalty in my opinion. In general we played with quality, our emotional control was high and we tried to move the ball right and left. It is not easy against Chelsea, they are very strong and physical. We deserved a little more, but our performance gives us confidence. The most important thing is the score, but the way we tried to win is important also. We are in a good position still. We have things in our hand. We must continue to do what we did today, and we will cause problems to the teams in our last three games.”Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas are interviewed by BT Sport. Cahill: “It was tough. They needed a result and pushed hard at the end. They made it difficult. But we needed it, dug in, and got the result. We’ve done our job, and now we will try to win every game this season, and see where it leaves us.”Here’s how it affects the teams. Bottom first. Swansea remain in 17th position, but they’re now only a point above Southampton, who beat Bournemouth earlier today. Stoke, who earned a fine point at Liverpool, are a further three points back, and they’ve played a game more. West Brom also won today, at Newcastle, to keep their slim hopes of a miraculous escape alive. Misery for the Swans.Chelsea will be cock-a-hoop, though. Their third Premier League win on the bounce has moved them to within two points of fourth-placed Tottenham, though Spurs have a game in hand. Liverpool could also be overhauled: they’re six clear of Chelsea, but have played a game more, and the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge next weekend. Liverpool have 17 goals on Chelsea, though, so chances are they’ll need to drop points at home to Brighton in the last game of the season if Conte’s men are to leapfrog Klopp’s. But a top-four finish is a realistic prospect now: they’re putting the pressure on Spurs and Liverpool.And that’s that! Chelsea close the gap on Tottenham and Liverpool in the race for the Champions League. Swansea meanwhile are looking over their shoulder, with Southampton now just one point behind.90 min +4: Cahill wants Ayew sent off the Swansea striker barged into Cahill with some passion. But the referee does nothing.90 min +3: Cahill goes down in an off-the-ball incident with Jordan Ayew. Then gets up and instigates a shoving match.90 min +2: As does the second. This game is petering out.90 min +1: The first of three added minutes passes without too much drama.90 min: Andrew Ayew and Routledge combine well down the inside-left channel. Routledge has the ball at his feet inside the area. He slams towards the bottom left, but doesn’t catch it properly and Courtois gathers with confidence. Swansea are certainly giving it a go during these closing minutes, but they look so blunt up front.88 min: Carroll latches onto a poor Cahill headed clearance. From the left of the D, he sidefoots hard towards the bottom right. But it’s always curling a couple of inches wide. A lot of heads in hands around the Liberty, though, because for a split second that looked like it might go in.87 min: Mawson gives the ball to Willian on the halfway line. Chelsea are three on three. Mawson gets back to pester Willian and ruin Chelsea’s rhythm. The ball’s spread to Pedro on the left, but he’s offside.86 min: Dyer reaches the byline out on the right. His deep cross very nearly finds Routledge, but Moses wins the aerial battle. Swansea come again, Mawson sending a daisycutter goalwards from wide on the left. Courtois’s handling is impeccable.85 min: Morata comes on for Giroud.83 min: Moses bursts down the right and very nearly finds Giroud, six yards out. But Fabianski claims well.81 min: And then Olsson is replaced by Routledge. Swansea are going all-out attack now.80 min: Fabregas and Hazard are exchanged for Pedro and Willian.78 min: Naughton has a lash from distance. Courtois gathers. Then Swansea come again. Cahill slides in on Dyer, just inside the Chelsea box. It’s perfectly timed, though Swansea wanted a penalty. But Cahill got the ball.77 min: Swansea may have decided to go for it now. Andre Ayew drops a shoulder, cuts in from the right, and sends a curler towards the top left. If that was on target, it was in ... but it doesn’t curl back enough.76 min: Carroll spins into space down the right and crosses deep. Olsson, coming in from the other side, shoots low, but Azpilicueta is there to block.74 min: Chelsea go down the other end and nearly wrap it up. Hazard and Fabregas cause bother down the inside-right channel. The ball squirts to Moses, six yards out. He tries to guide it into the bottom right, but it spins violently wide of the right-hand post and out for a goal kick. All in slow motion. How did that stay out?72 min: Dyer one-twos with Carroll down the right, then bursts into the Chelsea box. He fires low across the face of goal Azpilicueta slides the ball out for a corner on the right. From the set piece, Courtois flaps. Jordan Ayew tries to eyebrow a header over a melee and into the net ... but sends it over the bar.71 min: Emerson goes on a marathon run from the left wing, inside his own half, to the right of the Swansea D. He shoots towards the bottom right. Fabianski smothers.69 min: Azpilicueta, dropping deep down the right, curls a perfect cross onto the head of Hazard, who is lurking on the penalty spot. Hazard flashes a header straight at Fabianski. He was offside anyway, which is just as well: that would have gone down as a bad miss, so sweet was the cross.68 min: Bakayoko drags a wild shot left of the target from 20 yards.67 min: Giroud, Fabregas and Hazard make their way upfield at speed, raking long-range diagonal passes to each other as they zig-zag towards the Swansea box. But Naughton does very well to hold Hazard up down the left. 65 min: A free kick for Swansea out on the left. Ki swings it long towards Dyer, who is being marked by the significantly larger Giroud. The outcome is pretty much as you’d expect.64 min: Swansea make their second change: Carroll comes on for Roberts.62 min: Azpilicueta flicks a lovely reverse pass down the right to release Fabregas into a lot of space. Fabregas has time to consider his options, but inexplicably blooters his cross straight at van der Hoorn. Swansea clear their lines.60 min: A poor pass out to Rudiger from Courtois forces the defender to hack into the stand in a panic. Good pressing by Swansea. It leads to nought, but it’s another small example of the hosts’ renewed energy and determination. Courtois still hasn’t had a save of note to make, mind.58 min: The first change of the evening is made by Swansea City. King is replaced by Dyer.57 min: Hazard dawdles down the left before flicking the ball inside for Emerson, who lashes a shot-cum-cross straight at Fabianski.55 min: Chelsea finally get the ball back and nearly punish Swansea on a quick break. Hazard slips the ball wide right for Moses, who tries to roll the ball inside for the adventurous Azpilicueta in the centre. The pass is intercepted. So nearly number two, though.54 min: A good period of possession for Swansea. They don’t really trouble Chelsea with it, but it’s a confidence builder, perhaps. They’ve been a lot quicker in their actions since the restart.52 min: Emerson makes good down the left and stands one up in the middle. Mawson heads clear under pressure from a couple of blue shirts. This is a good end-to-end game, all of a sudden.51 min: This is much better from Swansea. Olsson hugs the touchline on the left, then whips high and hard into the Chelsea area. Jordan Ayew gets a head to it. His powerful effort flicks off Rudiger. The referee misses the deflection, so it’s a goal kick.50 min: Hazard runs at speed towards the Swansea back line. He lays off to Giroud, expecting a crisp clipped return as he breaks into the box. But Giroud lazily wafts his leg at the ball, sending it sailing gently towards Fabianski. Swansea were light at the back there Giroud should have been a lot more businesslike.48 min: Ki slides the free kick down the right for Clucas, who aims a cross deep for Mawson. But there’s some shoving the box, and the whistle peeps.47 min: Bakayoko sticks a leg across Jordan Ayew. A free kick out on the right, and a chance for Swansea to load the box.It’s the second half! Swansea get the party started again. No changes.As things stand, Champions League football is a very real prospect for Chelsea again next season. Championship football could be Swansea’s fate, unless they get their act together.45 min: Olsson breaks down the left. Had he lifted his head to take a look around, he’d have spotted Clucas tearing free down the middle, screaming for the ball. But he didn’t. Eventually it comes, but far too late, and Bakayoko comes across to cover and hack clear. That’s a real chance spurned. Chelsea were wide open for a while there.44 min: Swansea stroke it around the back awhile, and Chelsea are quite happy to let them do it, because they’re going nowhere. “Jon Moss has certainly made a few odd decisions,” begins Matt Dony, “but they have helped and hindered both sides, so kind of evened out. Maybe he’s a Karma Chameleon.”42 min: It is tipping down in Swansea, by the way.

I ended up going to a technical college, just to keep my mum and dad happy. Then the college asked me to leave.A child psychologist diagnosed me with Asperger’s, I must have been about 14.

I ducked out of it when my children arrived.Eye contact is something I find incredibly difficult. I count all the time when I’m talking to someone to make sure I do it right. Anything less than two seconds is considered rude, more than five seconds is too intense, so I have to look away. I worked that out myself. I find conversations incredibly stressful.Being under house arrest in India on suspicion of smuggling and spying was unexpected. Another air-display pilot and I were flying around the world in a little aeroplane. We landed in a small village on the coast of India and got arrested on suspicion of smuggling and spying. It was madness. The policeman asked if we were taking photographs of the Russian submarine base. I said I wasn’t, but asked where it was. He told me it was 20 miles south!I voted for Thatcher. It was the only time I voted. She won her election by a landslide, I wasn’t the only one that got sucked in.

Now brewers have gone one better and created a beer made from leftover sandwich bread.It is a tasty solution to the shocking daily waste of bread, with more than 24 million slices thrown away in Britain every day by consumers alone. Three new beers will soon be available at Marks \u0026amp Spencer made from surplus bread from its sandwich factory that would otherwise be discarded or turned into animal feed.Suffolk brewery Adnams is using the crusted “ends” of sliced sandwich loaves – frozen by M\u0026ampS supplier Greencore in Northampton and then sent to the brewery’s headquarters in Southwold – to create the new beers, which are already on sale in some M\u0026ampS stores and will soon be available to order online.Making beer out of bread isn’t new – its history stretches back 4,000 years to a time when brewers and bakers worked together. The difference is that the new beers use bread that would otherwise go to waste.Bread is made from grains such as barley, wheat and rye – exactly the same raw materials that are used to make beer. In this case, surplus crusts are mashed down into the mix and replace some of the malted barley traditionally used in brewing to create the Used Our Loaf range.Each batch of the new beer will use 700kg of surplus bread with three times the quantity of malted barley. And using bread has an added benefit of helping to reduce carbon emissions from the energy-intensive brewing process.The three Used Our Loaf beers are a triple English hop pale ale, a raspberry fruit beer and an Earl Grey pale ale. If the drinks prove popular with customers, the process will be rolled out across a wider range of beers.The ingredient switch is similar to that of the popular Toast Ale, launched two years ago by Tristram Stuart, founder of the food waste charity Feedback. Stuart was inspired to use leftover bread to make beer by a Belgian brewer who follows the same\u0026nbspprocess. Toast Ale is now brewed in the US, South Africa, Iceland and Brazil. All distributable profits go to Feedback to help end food waste while its original online open-source recipe – which replaces a third of the malted barley with bread (equivalent to one slice a bottle) – has now been downloaded 30,000 times.Richard Applegate, an M\u0026ampS beer technologist, said: “Consumers who are fans of beer will be familiar with Toast Ale, and we wanted to find a way to use the surplus bread from our sandwiches in a more useful and environment-friendly way.”M\u0026ampS launched pre-packaged sandwiches in Britain in 1981 and now sells 92.7 million a year, of which 72.4\u0026nbspmillion are conventional sandwiches and the rest baguettes and wraps.Fergus Fitzgerald, head brewer at Adnams, said: “Making malted barley is an energy-intense process, therefore by using bread this reduces the carbon footprint the saving from the three new beers is an estimated 1.2\u0026nbsptonnes of carbon dioxide.”Toast Ale notably works with Wold Top Brewery in North Yorkshire, one of the UK’s most sustainable breweries. And it recently became the first UK beer company to certify as a “B Corporation”, joining a global movement of people using business as a force for social good. A B Corporation is to business what Fair Trade certification is to, say, coffee or organic certification is to milk, and means the company meets rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency.Meanwhile, the brewery has launched a new batch of beer brewed with surplus bread from the EAT sandwich chain.“It’s great that bakeries and retailers are teaming up with social enterprises and charities to stop so much food being wasted,” said Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. “But the real problem lies with the big industrial loaf manufacturers and the supermarkets. We’d like to see far less surplus being generated in the first place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5635ff0195424b59086db2208016b1452075c82b/0_437_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a280e4f8a1ef68b0cb2a1860f9e4692","title":"the secret to surviving being childless when its not your choice","story":"Seek out other people who know what you’re going throughDon’t let sadness force you to buy into the idea that you’ve done anything wrong, or that there’s something fundamentally wrong with you. It’s hard enough to cope with without beating yourself up more.Seek out other people who know what you’re going through. It can take a long time to give up hope of becoming a biological parent, but with that can come real grief, which is often unrecognised by others. Look for involuntarily childless people online or via local groups. It’s a huge help having others who understand how it feels to be “the last one standing” among your mates.Ignore anyone who tells you to relax and it will magically happen. Parenthood is not the only way to have a fulfilling and meaningful life. Putting all your focus on becoming a parent can make you lose sight of the other great aspects of your life, so make a point of enjoying those things, especially the ones that are easier for people without the responsibilities of parenthood.Don’t fall prey to grief tourism, which can come from strangers as well as those close to you. Some people are simply too nosy, demanding details in the guise of caring. When pressed too far on the children issue, say, “I just can’t talk about it”, and hope they feel embarrassed enough to back off.The relationships you have with godchildren, nieces and nephews, and friends’ children can be very special and even healing.

I am not sure I like the term – 1970s convenience food springs to mind – but I love what it stands for: the idea that, after doing the prep, you can sit down with a cuppa or a glass of wine and relax for an hour or two while your meal more or less cooks itself. And, unlike a stew, which offers the cook a similar break, a bake retains much of the freshness and integrity of its components, particularly vegetables.This ‘cake’ was a revelation to me: who would have thought you could cook pasta for two hours and end up with something fresh, super-comforting and full of texture? Serve hot for lunch or dinner, or leave to cool, cut into wedges and have it as a portable cold lunch for work, school or as part of a picnic spread. Bear in mind that the chilli heat really comes through, so leave it out if you want to make this more child-friendly.250g fresh egg lasagne sheets, torn into large pieces½ butternut squash, (400g net weight) peeled, deseeded and cut into very thin, 2-3mm-thick slices (use a mandoline, ideally) 50g parmesan, grated3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed65g pine nuts, toasted35g basil leaves, roughly torn1½ tbsp fresh thyme leaves¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg¾ tsp dried chilli flakes 1 egg2 large plum tomatoes (220g net weight), coarsely grated and skins discarded 150g baby spinach3 tbsp olive oil200g ricotta200g feta, crumbled into 1-2cm piecesSalt and black pepper2 tsp parsley leaves, chopped Heat the oven to 170C335Fgas 3½. Line the base and sides of a 22cm cake tin with baking paper.Put the first 12 ingredients in a large bowl with two tablespoons of olive oil, three-quarters of the ricotta and feta, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, 50ml cold water and plenty of pepper, and stir to combine.Tip the pumpkin mix into the cake tin, pressing it down firmly to flatten, then top with the remaining ricotta and feta, and cover securely with foil. Bake for an hour and a half, then discard the foil, drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of oil and bake for another half-hour, until the top is crisp and browned. Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then remove from the cake tin, sprinkle with parsley and serve.Slow-roasting transforms garlic into a sweet and sticky version of itself, which, when combined with pungent, raw garlic, gives a dish a real umami kick.

Take out two garlic cloves from the head of garlic, then drizzle the rest of the bulb with a teaspoon of oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Wrap tightly in foil and roast for 40 minutes, until the cloves are soft and golden brown. Remove the foil and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves and discard the papery skins.While the garlic is roasting, prepare the rest of the vegetables. Combine the potatoes, shallots and paprika in a bowl with two tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Toss the cabbage leaves in a tablespoon of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and lots of pepper. Roughly crush the two reserved cloves of raw garlic and mix with all the herbs, the spring onions, lemon zest and the cooked garlic. Set aside a quarter of the herb mixture – you’ll use it later as a garnish.Arrange a third of the cabbage leaves over the base of a 20cm x 30cm, high-sided baking dish. Cover with half the potato and shallot mixture, top that with a third of the herb mixture, then dot half the ricotta and gruyère over the herbs. Repeat these four layers again, then top everything with a final layer of cabbage and the last of the herb mixture.Combine the stock, lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt and pour evenly over the bake, lifting up some of the cabbage leaves so the liquid sinks down. Cover tightly with foil and bake for an hour and 10 minutes, until the cabbage and potatoes are soft and cooked through. Remove the foil, drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of oil and bake, uncovered, for 10 minutes more, until the cabbage begins to crisp up and turn golden brown.

We’re devastated to be walking away from the jobs we love but we’ve been left with no choice.”An overwhelming majority of staff belonging to the NUJ and Bectu, which represents technical staff, have now voted to back industrial action in an attempt to force concessions from management. Al-Jazeera English is based in Doha but has about 130 staff in London, whose responsibilities include producing the news channel’s output between 4pm and 10.30pm GMT. These programmes are likely to be affected by the strike action. Union officials said they expect a substantial proportion of London-based al-Jazeera English staff to take part in the walkout, including on-air presenters, programme editors, field producers, reporters, camera operators and studio technical staff. After the strike, union members have pledged to adopt a policy of work-to-rule, including refusing to answer phone calls or emails outside of working hours and taking allotted breaks.“Journalists don’t take lunch breaks,” said Ging. “We’ll be taking lunch breaks.” Union officials said they remain open to resuming meaningful negotiations at any point and will consider suspending strike action if they believe there is a chance of achieving progress on a pay deal.Al-Jazeera did not respond to a request for comment.The news channel’s influential Arab-language sister station is at the centre of a dispute between Qatar and other Arab states including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain. The countries were among those that severed diplomatic relations with Doha last summer, imposed a trade blockade on Qatar, and issued a list of 13 demands including the shutdown of al-Jazeera and its affiliate stations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb49fd083414c92727813ff10ca41f6f477648de/113_42_2210_1326/master/2210.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2077aedd80520b6e943417b15dd9a94e","title":"janelle monae dirty computer observer review","story":"The title of Janelle Monáe’s third full-length outing – a frontrunner for album of the year – suggests compromised hardware, the gunk in the machine. And really, a tech fetish would have come as little surprise for Monáe’s return to music. Machines have long been her thing.Well before her performances in the films Moonlight and Hidden Figures, and before her features on records by Grimes and fun., the singer-turned-actor came to renown with her own stylish, sci-fi concept album. Set in a futuristic dystopia, The ArchAndroid (2010) starred a saviour robot, Cindi Mayweather, and disdained easy categorisations, combining R\u0026ampB, pop and rock with Fritz Lang’s polis and southern states sass.The early Monáe offered up dazzling avatars, embraced the speculative and swerved the lanes often assigned to young black women. She sang about far-fetched ideas, not sex she wore black-and-white, uniform-style outfits that did not bare skin, but instead bore witness to her parents’ service industry jobs. She was cerebral, thought-provoking and refreshingly original, if, perhaps, a little distant. She even had a workshop-cum-label, Wondaland, in her adopted Atlanta, which mirrored Prince’s Paisley Park. During the filming of Black Panther, the cast would gather there for downtime and to listen to early cuts of Monáe’s newest songs.Now, with her profile burgeoning from screen roles, and stirring speeches at last year’s Women’s March and this year’s Grammys, Dirty Computer seizes Monáe’s moment. It is emphatically about people, and not our best metalwork. When Monáe offered a sneak peek at it in London last March, she frolicked and mimed her way through five tracks from the album’s midsection in the company of a bevy of dancers, in a celebration of joyous #blackgirlmagic. Hearing the songs again on headphones, without themed cocktails, their brio is undimmed.Ditching Monáe’s earlier sci-fi tropes, Dirty Computer retains some vestigial allegory. Co-starring Monáe and her Are-they-aren’t-they? muse Tessa Thompson, a short film – Monáe calls it an “emotion picture” – screened on MTV and BET in the US the night before this album’s release. Although the plot is set in another nearly now dystopia, the album is very much set somewhere pink and engorged and vulnerable.We are the dirty computers, with our corrupted drives, although Monáe’s liberating message here is on behalf of those who don’t fit the Trump-era matrix: the marginalised, “highly melanated”, the non-straight, the poor.The track Django Jane, released a couple of months ago, best displays Monáe’s fearlessness: every rapped line is barbed and brilliant, taking in her background, her success, its possible tokenism (“Prolly give a Tony to the homies”) and concluding with a salvo on behalf of creative black womanhood even calling it “a salvo on behalf of creative black womanhood” can’t kill how great her flow is here.The politics of fear of the last few years (not to mention the inequity of ages) are woven through these songs of freedom and self-belief. Screwed (ft Zoë Kravitz) is, on the surface, a fruity pop tune that mulls how far south things have gone. But Monáe turns it into an analysis of power dynamics that takes in Prince (the Kiss-like opening riff), and Madonna (the dominatrix spoken bits). “Everything is sex, ’cept sex, which is power,” warns Monáe, a cultural studies professor manqué. “Now ask yourself, who’s screwing you?”The personal has long been political, but here Monáe is calling songs sweeping things such as Americans – the closing track, not the album’s most convincing – and singing pointed lyrics such as: “I am not America’s nightmare I am the American dream.” In one of the album’s most subversive acts, these bouts of flag-waving often come in the stadium pop vernacular, not hip-hop or R\u0026ampB. This album’s most obvious lodestone is 80s Prince, a Monáe collaborator and sounding board before his death in 2016, most audible on the terrific purple tribute, Make Me Feel. Here and there, though, there are faint and unexpected echoes of Taylor Swift.Released earlier this month, the song Pynk (ft Grimes) ided opinion, not least because of its high sugar content. It remains a sensational cut about cunnilingus, intimacy, and how all our insides are the same colour Peaches for millennials.Most specifically of all, though, Dirty Computer concerns Monáe, who is now wearing colours, baring skin and singing about herself and not Cindi Mayweather. Long-time fans might miss the steely distance of all the Afrofuturist conceptualising, Monáe’s rigorous otherworldliness. But the aim here is to rocket-propel Monáe into the mainstream, and on that count Dirty Computer succeeds: it is a juicy, genre-crossing pop record ripe with the funk, which somehow combines Beyoncé’s Lemonade and St Vincent’s Masseduction with lashings of Lauryn Hill.The price? A lot of these songs are about sex, often in swimming pools, the kind of R\u0026ampB Monáe used to define herself against. Crazy, Classic, Life is a case in point: here, Monáe is “young, black, wild and free, naked in a limousine”. There is huge joy in R\u0026ampB and hip-hop depictions of partying, contrasting as they do with the deprivations that often preceded them. However, the jolt here – Monáe going from buttoned-up sphinx to party girl – is a little startling. But Monáe doesn’t care she is sure of her tastes. I Like That is a declaration of iniduality that is – paradoxically – hugely accessible, quoting TLC’s CrazySexyCool.Secondly, for all Monáe’s long-time campaigning to “Fem the Future” and her impeccable girl-positive credentials, there are a lot of chaps at work on this feminist tour de force: Prince Pharrell Williams, squelchily frontin’ on I Got the Juice the sage advice of Stevie Wonder on Stevie’s Dream Brian Wilson on the title track’s harmonies.These reservations are offset by the depth of Monáe’s offering. You get a lot of her game face but you also get her insecurities. Drill down into the track listing and there are song titles such as Don’t Judge Me (airy psychedelic soul) and So Afraid (a grunge-like ballad that builds into more psychedelic soul) that get to the nub of things. Not Monáe’s sexuality per se, pretty much declared in the amazing vagina-trousered video for Pynk, but her fear: of letting the vast, trolly public in, of alienating the people who love her, as she points out in the sleeve notes to Don’t Judge Me. Monáe has cast off her carapace, and she’s frightened of the consequences. Somehow, it makes this album about fearlessness all the more inspiring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533fa5a18c3ecaf787b49f156b8340fb316e2254/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9a3d66eaed767b1b89273782f8188b0","title":"one to watch snail mail lindsey jordan lush","story":"From the age of five, Lindsey Jordan started having “really intense” classical guitar lessons, practising two hours a day.

As fast as the latest material arrives in vans from the printers, it disappears out of the door again, as canvassers grab handfuls and fan out across the streets of Wandsworth.This is the most important, closest and most keenly fought local election battle here in decades and canvass returns suggest the result is poised on a knife edge. “I would say the chances are 5050,” says Simon Hogg, the Labour leader on Wandsworth council, which has been held by the Conservatives since 1974.For Labour to storm this Tory fortress – Wandsworth was Margaret Thatcher’s favourite council and it boasts the country’s lowest council tax – would be a massive story. “It would be a political earthquake,” Hogg says. “And I think we can do it. More and more people are coming over to us in wards we have not won since the 1960s and 70s.”If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.The aftershocks would be felt nationally as well as locally. With Theresa May under pressure over immigration and the Windrush scandal, and struggling to prevent her party splitting irreparably over Brexit, a Labour win in Wandsworth and other urban Tory heartlands would ask still more questions about the prime minister’s chances of long-term survival in No 10.Out on the streets, Conservative-to-Labour converts are not difficult to find. A third of residents in this part of south London live in rented properties and the lack of affordable housing is a huge issue not just for tenants but for those who own their properties and those who worry their children will never be able to afford to leave home. Brexit, too, is on many voters minds, with Remainers outnumbering Leavers by a large margin.As Labour activists turn into her street, Sheila Arnold, 71, comes to the door. She has voted Tory all her life, as did her father before her. But she has had enough. “I’m going Labour this time and I never have before. There are not enough houses for the young people round here and that is not right.”Other things have upset her about the Conservatives. She agrees with them that immigration needs to be controlled but when she heard how May’s government had treated the Windrush generation she was horrified. “I think it is awful. We do have to control immigration but these people were invited in by us, and they helped us. This is their country now, their home, and they have been treated like muck. It is really terrible.”Across the road Remi Tangian, a domestic helper who came to the UK from the Philippines 30 years ago, feels the same way about how the Conservatives have treated the Windrush generation and is switching her vote. “It is so unfair,” she says. “We have to have change. I cannot agree with what they have done.”Time on the campaign trail suggests the wind is driving hard into Labour’s sails ahead of polling day. Yet there is a nervousness. Fear of falling just short is competing in the minds of party activists with excitement at the prospect of winning. What could be a great night in Wandsworth and other urban areas could just as easily turn into one of deflation and dejection.An opinion poll on Friday suggested Labour would gain a large number of seats on Thursday – but still fall short of taking the two great London prizes of Wandsworth and Westminster. As one Labour activist out on the streets put it on Friday afternoon: “The challenge for us is leave no stone unturned and whip up the sense we can do it, without raising expectations so high that we shoot ourselves in the foot if we fall short.”Across the capital, it is same story in traditionally Tory Westminster. The council has never fallen to Labour before. Currently the Conservatives hold 44 seats to Labour’s 16, meaning Labour needs an even bigger swing than in Wandsworth.Concerns about Brexit among its largely Remain electorate, plus worries about a lack of affordable housing and the memory of the Grenfell Tower disaster across the border in Kensington and Chelsea, all mean this election could go any way. That Adam Hug, the council’s Labour leader felt it worth his while to tramp through the borough on a wet Friday was evidence enough that he believes he has a chance. “We are aware that we would be making history if we were to win,” he says.Across the country more than 4,300 seats are being contested in 151 mainly urban councils. Analysis by Colin Rawlings and Michael Thrasher at Nuffield College, Oxford suggests that the Conservatives will lose 75 seats, with Labour gaining 200 and the Lib Dems 30. Ukip could lose most, if not all, of the 163 seats it gained last time. As Rob Ford points out on page 10, where former Ukip voters put their cross on Thursday will be one of the key psephological questions of election night.The vote will also be a key test for the shrunken Liberal Democrats and their leader Vince Cable. The party’s strength was built from strong roots put down over decades in local government. Occupying a distinct position on Brexit, as the only mainstream party implacably opposed, its supporters hope it will be able to mop up votes in Remain areas.The party has been pouring its resources into trying to retake control of Richmond and Kingston upon Thames in London from the Tories, and if it can it will have a decent story to tell on election night. Failure to do so – coupled with an inability to defend the London borough of Sutton – would raise further questions about what the party is for these days.For all the major parties the verdict of the electorate on Thursday and their reactions to the results on Friday will send important signals.Will Labour and Jeremy Corbyn be able to convey a sense of momentum sufficient to suggest the party is on course to win back power at national level? For the Tories, will May and her party be able stave off symbolic defeats at the hands of Labour in London and elsewhere, and steady their nerves?Can the Lib Dems show they can again be a big force in local government and begin rebuilding? Can Ukip simply survive?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c09116fef4088a9bbda33b93015ed37786720df0/57_0_3941_2365/master/3941.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12e84c4a147f497b158d34b8b8442d6f","title":"polling station voter id plans are deeply flawed say critics","story":"Electoral Reform Society says plans are ‘calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens’Plans requiring voters to prove their identity before casting their ballot are deeply flawed, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has said. The group said it appeared the plans were a “calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens”. Pilot schemes will be in place at Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking councils in the local elections in England on 3 May.The ERS said personification fraud, in which someone votes while pretending to be someone else, is “incredibly rare” and the introduction of mandatory voter ID poses more problems than solutions. The ERS chief executive, Darren Hughes, said: “It’s hard not to see this as a calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens. “As such it’s vital we think about the risks these changes pose to a free and fair franchise in the UK. We need policy based on hard facts, not rumour and innuendo. “With millions of people lacking the right photographic ID, and no government plans for a universal, free alternative, this can only mean another barrier for honest voters. “The government knows this, which makes this policy all the more concerning.” The ERS is part of a coalition of charities and campaign groups opposed to the change including Age UK, Stonewall, Liberty and the Salvation Army. The intervention comes after a leaked letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission said the change could have a disproportionate impact on voters from minority groups. Hughes said: “These deeply flawed trials must not be a fait accompli for the government’s plan to roll out an ill-thought policy. “Mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It’s time for an evidence-based approach instead.” In the Commons on Monday, the Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith defended the plans and said no one would need to buy new ID documents to be able to vote. She told MPs: “We already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the Post Office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach. “Democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ceb62ccd27aebb8de48c44484de92a8267acfe/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea409492e10bf8d5a1e66875241e7212","title":"sadiq khan labour local election wrest control hostile tories","story":"People in cities and towns up and down the country will go to the polls on Thursday to deliver their verdict on a government that seems to neither like us nor understand our values and way of life.Under Theresa May’s leadership, the Conservative party has turned its back on urban and suburban areas by pursuing policies and public spending decisions that discriminate against our cities and towns.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.Every new policy, decision and announcement seems designed to antagonise people living in urban areas. Not just the poor, the inner-city dwellers, the ethnically erse and the young – who the Conservatives have repeatedly failed – but also the middle classes, the commuters, those in the suburbs, and all who value Britain’s tolerance, ersity and proud traditions.This is hitting in particular people living in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle, but also places such as Milton Keynes, Swindon, Trafford, Walsall and Worcester. It is hardly surprising that residents in our cities and towns are turning their backs on the Tories when they have turned their backs on us.Public services have been decimated by years of austerity. Police numbers have been cut and crime is now rising. The housing crisis has gone from bad to worse across the country. We have a government using taxpayers’ money in the courts to avoid having to tackle toxic air pollution, and a prime minister who is willing to put our jobs, prosperity and rights at risk in pursuit of the most extreme and damaging version of Brexit possible – serving the Tory interest rather than the national interest.In the last week alone we have seen how little May’s government understands our values or our way of life. First, because of the heartbreaking, shameful and disgraceful treatment of the incredible Windrush generation. Second, because of the failure to have any plan on how to address the latest appalling national crime statistics. And third, with its refusal even to consider Britain remaining in the customs union after Brexit.There are three layers of state-enforced or enforceable departures of immigrants from the UK: deportations, administrative removals and voluntary departures.Deportations apply to people and their children whose removal is deemed \u0027conducive to the public good\u0027 by the home secretary. They can also be recommended by a court.\u0026nbspAdministrative removals refer to cases involving the enforced removal of non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally, outstayed a visa, or violated the conditions of their leave to remain.Voluntary departures are people against whom enforced removal has been initiated the term \u0027voluntary\u0027 simply describes how they leave. There are three sub-categories:\u0026nbspa) Those who depart via assisted voluntary return schemes. b) Those who make their own travel arrangements and tell the authorities.c) Those who leave without notifying the government.As the scandalous treatment of the Windrush generation emerged, Conservative politicians tried to give the impression that it was an anomaly, an accidental series of mistakes. But the British people know this is a lie. We know that it was the deliberate intention to create a “hostile environment” for migrants. We know this because the Conservatives have repeatedly bragged about this for years.Thousands of British people have been subject to inhumane treatment at the hands of the immigration system designed by May – a system that has turned lay people into unofficial immigration officers, requiring landlords to check the nationality of tenants, and forcing NHS staff to check the nationality of patients.May is also responsible for vans saying “go home” that were driven around the most ethnically erse parts of our country. The “hostile environment” of which she is the architect has played a role in fuelling ision and mistrust.This weekend’s revelations have exposed Amber Rudd even further as someone who appears completely unaware about what is going on in her own department. It frankly beggars belief. What the home secretary and prime minister don’t appear to understand is that the Windrush scandal is the direct consequence of their policies and not just another example of the administrative chaos at the Home Office.It is about a generation who have lived here all their lives suddenly feeling they are not wanted here. Rather than hiding behind process or blaming civil servants yet again, the time has now surely come for the home secretary to resign.What viewpoints do you think need to be heard that aren’t currently?

It seems there is a lot going on in the Home Office of which she is unaware.When the statistics were released, the home secretary, astonishingly, refused to even comment on them, never mind announce any policies to address the unacceptable rise in crime. The government should now be committing to invest in our police forces, public services and communities – resources desperately needed to enable us to be both tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.The same story is also true of the government’s ideological pursuit of the most extreme and reckless version of Brexit.Westminster is now in paralysis – tied up with the pursuit of a hard Brexit and a Tory government in chaos. So it is left to Labour to stand up for our cities and towns, to fill the leadership vacuum left by Westminster, to fix the challenges people face in their daily lives, and to fight for our public services and our values.The Tories have nothing to offer the voters of our cities and towns, not a single positive offer – just more of the same austerity and cuts. They are tired and devoid of any ideas. So it is now incumbent on all of us, but especially Labour – with our proud history of fighting for the many not the few, and fighting discrimination and racism – to ensure that our cities and towns are fair, inclusive, safe places for everyone. This includes redoubling our efforts to stamp out the antisemitism that has risen in recent years, wherever we find it.I urge everyone in every city and town across Britain to vote Labour this Thursday. To elect a Labour council that will stand up for you. To send a message to this Conservative government that we have had enough of its continual assaults on our values. And to take the crucial next step on the path to electing a Labour government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, that will understand our way of life and deliver the real change we so desperately need.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80186cedc46eb336d5cd13eeb6c52d496e2326b0/0_68_2512_1507/master/2512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb31ace60e3ba3528c0621e253cd8e8c","title":"ronnie osullivan knocked out bitter clash ali carter world championship","story":"Ronnie O’Sullivan clashed with Ali Carter at the Crucible row as the five-times winner crashed out of the World Championship.O’Sullivan, the title favourite, snapped at Carter in the 19th frame of the second-round match, describing the 38-year-old as “Mr Angry” after also appearing to barge him.Carter went on to clinch a 13-9 victory, his first win over O’Sullivan in a major tournament after years of trying.

Carter was clinical as he set up a quarter-final against Mark Williams or Robert Milkins.The four-times champion John Higgins, the new favourite, was in superb form to take an 8-0 lead over the qualifier Jack Lisowski. Earlier, Barry Hawkins completed a 13-10 victory over Lyu Haotian."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d946620f2ec86aea0ca6c80344c4629dd9b87b8/0_144_5341_3205/master/5341.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6bbf174aee753acc50d68f7d3a7b9aa","title":"sunshine on leith review proclaimers musical goes the distance","story":"West Yorkshire Playhouse, LeedsFeaturing 18 tracks by the Scottish duo, this spirited show is a thing of joy. By the time I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) comes on, resistance is futileWhisper it, but West Yorkshire Playhouse might just be making a case for the much-maligned jukebox musical. Knotting together 18 Proclaimers songs, Sunshine on Leith is refreshingly uncynical, resisting the easy wins and clunky contrivances that characterise most shows banking on a recognisable soundtrack. Even remounted after its success on the big screen in 2013, it feels like a thing of real joy, not a ploy to cash in.For James Brining, this revival of his original 2007 production is a return and an ending. It’s an opportunity to revisit the greatest hit of his time as artistic director of Dundee Rep, while concluding one chapter of the Playhouse’s story before it closes for refurbishment. In coming back to the show, he marries the strengths of the piece with the strengths of the space. In this version, an on-stage boozer spills out into the stalls of the Quarry theatre, creating a sense of lager-scented community in an auditorium that can so often feel cavernous and impersonal.Community is also central to the show itself. Stephen Greenhorn’s plot springs from some of the recurring concerns of the Proclaimers’ back catalogue: home, identity, love and Scottishness. In many ways it’s a tale of homecoming, opening as old mates Davy (Steven Miller) and Ally (Paul-James Corrigan) return from war to their beloved Leith and the relationships – both familial and romantic – of civilian life. The more politicised strain of the Proclaimers’ songwriting is briefly reflected in swipes at NHS cuts and nods to gentrification.There’s no escaping the sentimentality at the exposed, beating heart of this show. While skilfully braiding in various Proclaimers tracks, its narrative ticks all the big emotional boxes: love, loss, parenthood. In aiming squarely for the universal, though, Greenhorn’s script often lacks specificity. His characters are foremost daughters or sons, fathers or mothers, husbands or wives – defined by their relationships with one another rather than by any quirks or idiosyncrasies.The detail is instead supplied by Brining’s production, which teems with the stuff of everyday life. In an early Edinburgh street scene, as returning squaddies Davy and Ally weave past joggers, leaflet-pushers, buskers and coffee-guzzlers, Emily-Jane Boyle’s choreography brilliantly evokes the bustle of city pavements – real city pavements, not the high-kicking sidewalks of Broadway. Colin Richmond’s set, meanwhile, is crammed with the minutiae of the mundane, from Asda signs to wellies atop bus shelters. And while the on-stage bar inevitably recalls Once – the Musical, it’s more working men’s club than romanticised tavern. You can almost taste the Tennent’s.The real masterstroke is bringing the band on to the stage and among the actors. It’s not an original thought, but it’s perfect for the spirit of this piece. Guitar players pop up from behind bars and reception desks, as though the Proclaimers’ music has seeped irresistibly into the city. When a drinking session turns into a singsong (Over and Done With) or a pub full of Hibs fans offer marriage proposal advice (Let’s Get Married), the tunes somehow burst organically from the action rather than feeling imposed on to it. And while the biggest hits are used with admirable restraint, by the opening riff of I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles), resistance is futile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d98505a16e683fcac471844753e4979a680334/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59dfaf84a5eabc970998e0700a6a56bd","title":"stationery that looks good enough to eat in pictures","story":"When he turned seven, Neal Whittington’s uncle gave him a £7 WH Smith voucher: this started a lifelong obsession with stationery.

It is presented by Sara Cox, a one-time farmer’s daughter who absconded to the city and thus understands the gulf between town and country living. Farming is a round-the-clock job and finding a partner can be tough in a place where sheep outnumber humans 100 to one.A further 150 miles north of Pete is Christine, a smart, sweet-natured thirtysomething who runs a remote beef and sheep farm in Dumfries and Galloway. Christine has had her heart broken and is low on confidence, though that doesn’t stop her from getting potential boyfriends to rummage in her rams’ nether regions to check whether their balls have dropped. Other subjects include Mark, a Norfolk blacksmith who doesn’t believe in central heating a orced pig farmer, Wendy, on the lookout for a younger man and 28-year-old equine vet Heather, whose time is largely spent up to her armpit in horse.After viewing Pete and co’s dating profiles, potential suitors are asked to write old-fashioned letters for the hopefuls to sift through and narrow down for a speed-dating session. While Wendy and Christine look dolefully at their meagre offerings, Pete struggles to conceal his delight as he is handed 30 letters. Such is his bashfulness that he asks Wendy to read out an extract from one in which the applicant extols his “round, masculine features” and apologises for the drips of water on the page on account of her being fresh out of the shower when she wrote it. This is about as racy as Love in the Countryside gets. In a world in which dating shows ask contestants to size up would-be lovers’ genitals before their faces (hello Naked Attraction), and in which people are asked to score their partners on their looks (greetings Your Face Or Mine), Love in the Countryside trades in an unusually chaste form of courtship, so much so that there’s a collective gasp when a man sends Heather a picture of his arse. Bum shots aside, however, there is no nudity, no engineered antagonism and no unpleasantness here, only polite small talk, tentative hand-holding and closeups of bewildered-looking cows. Back in Yorkshire, there is frolicking in the cowshed as the three women on Pete’s shortlist explore the pens. “Ooh, it’s trying to nibble my bottom,” shrieks Francesca from Essex, as a calf greets her a little too warmly. Amid the undulating hills and gallons of cow shit, the search for a two-legged partner goes on.

On a visit to the area a few weeks previously, Đurić had been arrested by special forces, bundled into a police van, and unceremoniously deported. This time, Serbia’s point man for Kosovo issues was allowed to stay, albeit with a helicopter hovering noisily overhead to keep watch.Đurić was in Kosovo, which Serbia still officially regards as its province, to tour a microbrewery producing beer named in honour of a medieval battle which is key to Serbia’s emotional attachment to Kosovo. He also visited a spa resort, under construction to cater to Serbian pilgrims to the 14th-century Banjska monastery.“It is my duty to be here and to stand proudly with our people,” said Đurić to the gathered throng of television crews. “I invite all Serbian citizens to come here without prejudice, and experience their holy sites here in Kosovo and Metohija,” he said, using the Serbian name for the province.Under an agreement signed in Brussels in 2013, the Kosovo government was supposed to set up a so-called Association of Serbian Municipalities, which would bring Serb-majority areas into its system but would also give them a collective voice. Belgrade and Pristina are still jostling over the final format, as they edge towards a comprehensive deal to normalise relations and potentially usher in an EU future for both.Avni Arifi, chief of staff to Kosovo’s prime minister, said cultural guarantees and political representation for Serbs were already enshrined in its constitution, and he accused Belgrade of wanting to create a Trojan horse, akin to Republika Srpska, the increasingly autonomous Serb entity inside Bosnia. “They’re asking for us to give something more, but forgiveness is all they can get because everything else is taken,” said Arifi.Serbia’s president Aleksandar Vučić last week claimed that Kosovo had done “zero potato” to implement any of its promises. Vučić has been working the diplomatic circuit, trying to drum up support for concessions to Serbia, the details of which still remain vague, as well as prepare public opinion at home for potentially painful compromises.One of Belgrade’s suggestions, increasingly mentioned in the media, is a partition along the Ibar river, with North Kosovo going to Serbia possibly as part of an exchange involving majority-Albanian districts of southern Serbia. “All Serbs would say that’s one of the solutions,” said Vučić, while declining to comment on whether it was a specific goal in negotiations.Kosovo’s president Hashim Thaçi has ruled this option out. “There will be no ision of Kosovo. There will be no exchange of territory,” he has said. Western diplomats are also strongly opposed, at least in part because of the precedent it could set for other disputed borders in the Balkans.Additionally, many Serbs live in enclaves south of the river, such as Gračanica, just a few miles outside Pristina. A vast photograph of Vučić dominates the main square, where Serbian flags fly. Serbian dinars are accepted, as well as euros, the official currency. Gračanica’s Orthodox monastery, completed in 1321, is filled with frescos of biblical scenes, most notably a rendering of the Last Judgment complete with burning sinners. It is Kosovo’s medieval monasteries which create the emotional draw for many Serbs, who see it as the heart of their nation and religion.Here, the police force offers a rare glimmer of hope for those who would like to see an integrated, multi-ethnic Kosovo. Of the officers based at Gračanica’s station, 41 are Serbs and 12 are Albanian. Svetlana Kapetanović, a 43-year-old ethnic Serb policewoman who speaks fluent Albanian, said that in recent years ethnically motivated incidents have been extremely rare, with most of the force’s work hours dedicated to fighting petty crime. The officers all wear uniforms emblazoned with the Kosovo flag, at odds with the Serbian flags around the town.Kapetanović said she decided to learn Albanian after an incident at the beginning of her police career in 2003, when she was called with a group of Albanian officers to a domestic violence incident involving a young Albanian woman.“I was the only female officer there, and the girl was giving me looks, like she wanted to communicate something to me without saying it to the men. I could see she wanted help from me and I wanted to talk to her but I couldn’t speak Albanian and she couldn’t speak Serbian. I suspected there had been a rape, and reported it to my commander. Later, it turned out I had been right. It was then I realised that I needed to learn Albanian.”As a fluent Albanian speaker, Kapetanović is a rare Serb. While there is still a generation of Kosovo Albanians who remember Serbian, among the youth crossover it is rare. Children at Serbian-language schools, which still run on the Serbian state curriculum, learn no Albanian, and vice versa.“Unfortunately we still have a situation where Serbs and Albanians live separate lives,” said Dalibor Jevtić, the Serb deputy prime minister, who speaks Albanian. While dodging the issue of his own views on Kosovo’s status, Jevtić said all sides need to take a constructive approach to the language issue. Although his party, Serbian List, has strong links to Belgrade, he said it was not for Serbia to tell Kosovo Serbs how to live.“Ninety per cent of Serbs in central Serbia have never been to Kosovo. They don’t understand our lives and I don’t take it very seriously when they tell me how I should live my life with my neighbours,” he said.Although most Kosovo Serbs are still uneasy at the idea of independence, many now see unemployment and economic disenfranchisement as bigger threats than ethnic tensions. There are also ides within the community, starkly illustrated by the assassination in January of Oliver Ivanović, a Kosovo Serb politician who opposed Serbian List, which dominates the Serb political scene. Ivanović was shot dead in Mitrovica, split into Serbian and Albanian sides by the Ibar. Nobody has been arrested for the murder.“It’s not safe to speak freely in this town, but let’s just say it wasn’t Albanians who killed him,” said Marko Jakšić, a political associate of Ivanović, during an interview in North Mitrovica.Some Kosovo Serbs say Belgrade and Pristina are equally frustrating in using their predicament to score points. The high-profile Kosovo visits of Đuric and others often seem aimed at public opinion in Serbia rather than making material improvements for them. “For Belgrade, Kosovo is just a poker chip to be played on the path to Serbia’s EU integration,” said Jakšić. “Vučić is willing to play it, and Đuric is just meant to be the sedative that makes things easier for us.”Additional reporting by Una Hajdari"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5351384b7f4ecf373f100d38aed380445039636e/838_210_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=453f1b81168db9aeb78b1e23457c1e51","title":"north korea state media plays down kim jong uns nuclear pledge","story":"Kim Jong-un’s promise to denuclearise the Korean peninsula given little coverageNorth Korea’s state media is playing down Kim Jong-un’s pledge to pursue denuclearisation, made at a summit with South Korea, raising the stakes for Donald Trump’s upcoming talks with the young leader.Eliminating the nuclear weapons that North Korea claims could hit US cities is Washington’s core objective in talks with Pyongyang. It wants a process that is “complete, verifiable and irreversible”.Experts, however, have long warned that Kim is unlikely to give up missiles and warheads that have taken decades of work to build, particularly when they are the very reason the US president is coming to the negotiating table.While North Korea has repeatedly signalled it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, the conditions for that to happen may be too high a price to pay for the US and its allies.“The worst case scenario is learning the North Korean definition of denuclearization is untenable with international community’s expectations,” says Jenny Town, the assistant director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “When they think of denuclearization, they think it will come about over decades.”“It’s also dependent on having good relations with the US, and North Korea has seen the US pull out of many international agreements, so they won’t trust a simple promise, they want to build trust over time.”Kim is acutely aware of the fate of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up his weapons programmes only to have European and US forces bomb the country during an uprising against him.Other possibilities include a meeting relatively light on substance, focused on building goodwill between both sides and positive photo opportunities instead of touching on issues that could cause conflict.There is little chance of a concrete agreement of any kind resulting from the summit. Beginning negotiations with a meeting between the two leaders, before any details have been hammered out, is always risky. The meeting will likely be followed by months, if not years, of negotiations at the lower levels before anything is signed.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“It would be extremely strange – by basically any theory of human or political behaviour – for Kim to give up a deterrent right after attaining it,” said Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science and nuclear weapons. “Nothing is impossible, but it would be very unexpected, the strangest possible outcome.”North Korea’s state media only published details of the historic summit with South Korea on Saturday, the day after the rest of the world watched the meeting unfold on live television.State TV’s semi-retired anchor Ri Chun Hee, who has announced most major news in the isolated state for decades, returned to the nation’s screens to report on the talks with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.The meeting also filled a number of pages of the Saturday edition of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, including dozens of photos. Among the images of the leaders, their wives and the summit site, the text focused mostly on promises to try to bring lasting peace to the peninsula, rather than the goal of getting rid of nuclear weapons.“The emphasis is all on peace, the nation, dialogue and unification. Denuclearization is a small side issue,” wrote Peter Ward, a north Korea watcher based in Seoul, wrote in a detailed analysis of coverage in Pyongyang’s paper of record on Twitter.The Rodong Sinmun reproduced the two leaders’ joint declaration in full, which mentioned denuclearisation. It did not specify any details, however, and the newspaper did not otherwise touch on the issue, despite Trump’s repeated insistence that destroying North Korea’s nuclear capacity lies at the heart of US concerns.After months of sabre rattling, many in Seoul and further afield saw the talks as a welcome move to reduce tensions and the risk of miscalculations.North Korea, however, has a history of seeking rapprochement with the south, brokering deals to limit its nuclear ambitions in return for aid or other support – and then breaking them.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit hereTrump has warned that Washington will not be “played” by Kim, and that he will keep up a campaign of maximum pressure until the nuclear weapons are gone. If the two sides are unable reach a deal he will walk out of any summit, he has said. North Korea has its red lines too. The fate of leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up illegal weapons programmes and were then toppled by the west or western-backed movements, is well known in Pyongyang, and likely to add to Kim’s reluctance to abandon the country’s nuclear project. “It is still unclear whether North Korea still believes that it can have its cake and eat it too,” said Victor Cha, who until January was in the running to become US ambassador to South Korea.The meeting had positive atmospherics but did not clarify whether Kim was genuinely considering giving up his nuclear weapons or just hoped to freeze programmes in return for sanctions relief and aid, he told the Associated Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f8af50cbf34a55ec7c08f133769afbec7c4fbc/0_222_4568_2741/master/4568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13c269868e2e3322cf3951c9288a242f","title":"six months metoo how soon guys come back hadley freeman","story":"Months are like dog years for men, so four months on the sidelines for a man is definitely the same as decades of groping for a womanGosh, remember the #MeToo movement? That was exciting, wasn’t it? All that talk about how nothing was ever going to be the same again. No longer would men get away with sexually exploiting women, and powerful men who once seemed untopplable were duly toppled. Red lines, everyone said, had been drawn. And six months on from the beginning of this movement, there’s only one question, really, that is being asked: how soon can these guys come back?“Several powerful men, in several industries, have had their worlds kicked out from under them as the #MeToo movement has gathered momentum… Is a comeback possible?” an article in the New York Times recently asked about the American chef Mario Batali. Yes, the poor men! Those accusations really came out of nowhere for them. It might be worth interjecting at this point that Batali, a popular and powerful media figure in America, is alleged to have sexually harassed women for decades. But the allegations came out in December, and it’s April now, and we all know months are like dog years for men, and so four months on the sidelines for a man is definitely the same as decades of groping for women.Similar pieces have also run in the past few weeks about US journalist Matt Lauer, whom you might remember as the one who allegedly had what was referred to as “a sex button” on his desk, allowing him to lock his office door from his desk while he harassed women. Similarly, Garrison Keillor, who reportedly made female employees feel “mistreated and sexualised” for years, is “determined America still wants to hear his voice”, if, perhaps, not feel his hands and receive his creepy emails.The Hollywood Reporter recently ran a heart-tugging profile of the once eminence grise broadcaster Charlie Rose, depicting him as “broken, brilliant and lonely”, miserably playing tennis at his $4m-$6m home. “I think he is trying to understand,” a friend told the reporter. Allow me to help you with that, Charlie. You have been accused of harassment by multiple women, who say you groped them, made gross late-night phone calls to them, exposed yourself to them and put your hand down their trousers while they cried. Your habit of giving women surprise massages was so established, it was referred to by your colleagues as “the crusty paw”. So ponder on that while you and your crusty paw are hitting those tennis balls, Rose.Last November, Louis CK finally admitted, after years of denials, to masturbating in front of women. Some of his victims had gone public with their accusations in the past, and CK’s denials had left them open to abuse from his fans – something, incidentally, all those who question the credibility of anonymous allegations in similar situations could do with bearing in mind.This argument has come up a lot since the start of the #MeToo movement, with men solemnly explaining to women that a grope is really not the same as a rape, which is super helpful of them because if there’s one group who really aren’t clear about the severity of rape, it’s women. But increasingly when I hear someone say, “Harassment isn’t as bad as rape”, what they seem to be saying is, “It isn’t that bad at all.”All of these men are multimillionaires, so concerns about their current lack of employment are not based on them no longer being able to pay the gas bill. Rather, it shows that, despite the alleged realigning of power dynamics by #MeToo, men are still seen as the stars of the show and women as faceless background nobodies. You know, it’s that classic Hollywood plot: man strives for success, man gets success, man frantically masturbates in front of women and gives them the crusty paw, man makes glorious comeback. In the case of Batali, Rose, Lauer and Keillor, it’s the men wanting this storyline in the case of CK, it seems to be others wanting it for him. In all cases, it’s the diminishing of the women who were harassed. Are the women these men exploited being interviewed about how their careers were hampered? How they were denied opportunities because they spoke up, or said no? The answer, of course, is ha ha ha. Increasingly it looks like #MeToo didn’t topple the patriarchy – it showed how tenacious the patriarchy is at enforcing its stranglehold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282468569bbf9126af064c2ab010b79e7522caac/0_0_6616_4411/master/6616.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07f09f1370fcab954e67b20cb92a816 700w","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options.

Photograph: Collins CourtsThe clinical director of the national cervical cancer screening programme advised a Limerick gynaecologist to file some audited test results rather than to tell women in certain cases that all-clear smear tests they had received years earlier were wrong.Dr Gráinne Flannelly, clinical director of CervicalCheck, told gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in an email in July 2017 that several women in the mid-west region should not be told about the false negative tests discovered in an audit after he wrote to her to confirm that she felt some women with cervical cancer should not be informed about them.The private correspondence was submitted in the High Court case taken by Vicky Phelan, a 43-year-old mother of two with terminal cancer from Annacotty, Co Limerick who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.The records emerged after Dr Flannelly publicly acknowledged that she could not say for sure that all of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer had been made aware of the situation.Dr Hickey wrote to Dr Flannelly on June 20th, 2017 referring to a list of patients with cervical cancer noting that in three highlighted cases the women should be told about the false smear test results after a 2014 review.“There were other ladies where the review process has altered the original smear report and it looks from your notes that you have felt that these should be filed in the patients’ notes and that no review is necessary,” Dr Hickey wrote to her at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street in Dublin.“I just wanted to confirm that you are happy with this whole process centrally from the Cervical Screening Unit given that it looks that some of the review smears were different from the original.”Dr Flannelly replied on July 7th, 2017 in an email with the subject line “clarification”.“Yes – a balance needs to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit. The possibility of resultant harm is crucial,” she wrote.In cases where women have not had cancer or who have “local and fertility-sparing surgery”, Dr Hickey should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical notes, Dr Flannelly wrote.“The concept of delay is important,” she said. “I based my judgment on the medical information available to me and using the same criteria I use in my own practice when dealing with these cases. Only three of the women merited a closeout meeting using these criteria,” Dr Flannelly wrote.On August 8th, 2017, after being told by Dr Hickey that he had taken it upon himself to inform all the affected women, Dr Flannelly wrote to him again, noting his decision and saying that this “underscores the value of the local clinician reviewing the clinical context”.“The advice I gave was based on the limited information available to me and was given as an honest assessment of what seemed to be the best way to proceed with these cases,” she said.“It is right and fitting that your own clinical judgment should take precedence.” Yesterday, Minister for Health Simon Harris appointed a senior team of experts to examine the cases of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer and to assess how many were not made aware of the delay in diagnosis.The appointments followed Mr Harris’s failure to declare confidence in the leadership of the programme. A HSE spokeswoman said Prof Flannelly would be “continuing in her role” and was “directly involved” in the process to provide assurance around the communications with the 206 women whose cases were under review.Asked about doctors using their “judgment” on whether to inform patients of wrong test results, the spokeswoman said the “practice was deemed to be appropriate and is in line with the practice in the UK for the communication of cancer audit reviews”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3477974.1524939559!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"harris tells cervicalcheck to facilitate re tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris has called on CervicalCheck to facilitate further smear tests.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476904.1524855004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"six decades on a ray of light reaches franco s resting place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLawyer Eduardo Ranz, with  family members of Spanish Civil War victims who want their dead relatives exhumed, at the entrance of the Basilica of the Valley of the Fallen. Photograph: Juan MedinaThe monument known as the Valley of the Fallen, containing the body of the dictator Francisco Franco, has barely been touched since its completion in 1959. But that may be about to change.Last Monday, a group of relatives of men who were also buried at the site gathered at its entrance amid a swarm of TV cameras and photographers. These people have registered requests for the bodies of their loved ones to be dug up in order to be given a decent burial elsewhere.A team of experts entered the site and carried out preliminary checks to see if a search for the bodies in question is feasible.Eduardo Ranz, the young lawyer representing the families, described it as a historic day.“It’s the biggest mass grave in Spain, ” he told The . “This place is outside the bounds of democracy.”Situated in a wooded area 60km north of Madrid, the Valley of the Fallen is Spain’s biggest and most controversial reminder of its 1936-1939 civil war and the four-decade dictatorship that followed. Its construction began after the war ended and republican prisoners who had fought against Franco were used to build it.The monument’s centrepiece is a 150m-high stone cross. Beneath it is a basilica, drilled deep into the mountainside at the end of which lies the tomb of Franco, who died in 1975, just a few steps away from the main altar.On either side of the tomb, the remains of 33,700 people killed in the civil war lie grouped together in boxes in underground crypts, most of them unidentified. It is from these crypts that those gathered on Monday want to find and exhume their relatives.For Rosa Gil, the granddaughter of one of those buried there, the opening-up of the basilica to the team of experts was “a day of hope and happiness”.Her grandfather, Pedro Gil Calonge, died in 1937 in northern Spain, fighting for Franco. But his remains were exhumed from a cemetery in Zaragoza in the early 1960s and transferred to the Valley of the Fallen without his family being informed, as part of an initiative to make the site a cemetery for victims of the civil war.Rosa says that when her father, Silvino Gil, who had been a pro-Franco politician, found out the truth a few years ago, he said: “Why should Franco be able to move my father’s body?”The families of eight men whose bodies were moved to the Valley of the Fallen are now hoping to get them exhumed, although initially only four are being searched for. The fact that the eight are from both sides of the civil war – six were leftist republicans and two fought for Franco’s right-wing nationalists – reflects the potentially groundbreaking nature of this case.It was put in motion in May of 2016, when a court authorised the exhumation from the Valley of the Fallen of two republican brothers, Manuel and Antonio Ramiro Lapeña, at the request of the former’s granddaughter. Other requests followed.However, the prior of the Benedictine monastery at the Valley of the Fallen, Santiago Cantera, refused to open the crypt, blocking the procedure. The families hoping to exhume their relatives filed a legal complaint against Cantera for disobeying a court order. The standoff was resolved last month, when Archbishop Ricardo Blázquez, chairman of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, stepped in.The legacy of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship has long been a thorny issue. In 2007, the then-Socialist government introduced a historical memory law, which included the removal of public symbols of Franco and his regime. But although statues of the dictator and street signs bearing his name and those of his officials were taken down, many symbols remain and no steps were taken with regard to the Valley of the Fallen, which is today visited by tourists and Franco nostalgists.The bodies of over 100,000 victims of Franco from the war and its aftermath lie in unmarked graves across Spain and volunteers who identify and exhume them do not receive state funding.The issue tends to ide Spaniards along political lines, with those on the left more inclined to favour tackling the historical memory issue and those on the right often warning such an approach risks reopening old wounds.It is still early days and the forensic experts might yet decide that locating the bodies in the Valley of the Fallen will be too difficult. The lawyer, Eduardo Ranz, urged caution, but said he and his clients are prepared to wait.“The work will be completed when the families can give their loved ones a dignified burial,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Virtual reality headsets are helping to fight opioid crisis in USWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

It is also one of the Duke of Cambridge\u0027s own middle names.Kensington Palace said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles.The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge showing their third child to the world outside the Lindo Wing on MondayThe name is a significant tribute to the Royal Family, with the newborn Prince sharing names in common with his brother Prince George Alexander Louis, his father Prince William Arthur Philip Louis, and his grandfather Prince Charles Philip Arthur George.Kensington Palace announced the name of the Royal couple\u0027s third child, who was born on Monday at 11.01am weighing 8lb 7oz.The Duke and Duchess will have shared the name with the Queen and the rest of their family before making it public.The announcement had been eagerly anticipated since the couple showed off their new son to the world on the steps of the exclusive maternity unit, the Lindo Wing, on Monday evening.Popularity of the boys\u0027 name Louis since 1904Since then, the Duke and Duchess have been kept busy settling in to life as a family of five at Kensington Palace.Born fifth in line, the baby is the Queen and Philip\u0027s sixth great-grandchild and Kensington Palace said the couple, along with the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and the Middletons, were delighted with the news of the new arrival. The Duke of Cambridge joined his brother Prince Harry and soon-to-be sister-in-law Meghan Markle at Westminster Abbey for an Anzac Day service on Wednesday afternoon.But the topic of conversation quickly turned to the new Prince.It\u0027s a boy Celebrating the Royal baby - in picturesAsked how the Duchess and the baby were doing, Prince William said: They\u0027re very well thanks.The now father of three said they are in good form, luckily, and added: Sleeping\u0027s going reasonably well so far, so he\u0027s behaving himself which is good news.Prince William greets his brother Harry\u0026#39s fiancee Meghan Markle as they arrive for an Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey A delighted Prince of Wales welcomed the birth of his third grandchild, saying it was a “great joy”.Speaking for himself and the Duchess of Cornwall, presumably with a twinkle in his eye, he said: “We are both so pleased at the news.  “It is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them.”The Prince is now a grandfather to Prince George, four, Princess Charlotte, who will turn three on May 2, and the baby boy.The Prince of Wales already has two grandchildren in Prince George and Princess Charlotte, pictured arriving at the Lindo WingThe Duchess of Cornwall also has five grandchildren who are regular visitors to their home, with the Prince said to delight in reading the youngsters stories.The Prince’s words chimed perfectly with those of his son the Duke, who had held up three fingers - one for each of his children - when departing from hospital and laughed that he had “thrice the worry now”.The Duke of Cambridge holds up three fingers as he tells the media he has \u0026#39thrice the worry now\u0026#39 as he leaves the Lindo Wing Louis was the first name of the Prince of Wales\u0027 beloved great-uncle Earl Mountbatten of Burma.Charles will be touched that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided to pay tribute to Lord Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979, by naming their son Prince Louis.The name, also one of Prince George\u0027s middle names, is French and German in origin and means renowned warrior.Louis was the 71st most popular name in England and Wales, according to the latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics.In 2016, just 911 boys were given the name Louis in England and Wales.It was more popular in the early 2000s when it ranked around 39th, but was not popular throughout the 20th century.Louis has been the name of many rulers across the world, including 18 kings of France.Lord Louis Mountbatten pictured in 1977, two years before he was murdered by the IRAFamous people named Louis include pop star Louis Tomlinson from One Direction and jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong.Lord Louis Mountbatten was also the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s uncle and the brother of Philip\u0027s mother Princess Alice.He was the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947.He was very close to Charles but Uncle Dickie, as he was known in the family, was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979.His boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland.Prince George and Princess Charlotte had already been introduced to the new baby at St Mary’s Hospital and were likely being eased into their new roles as big brother and middle sister in their own home on Tuesday.Pippa Matthews, the first visitor seen driving into the Palace, spent several hours with her sister, the Duchess, and infant nephew before being photographed driving away.Pippa Middleton pictured leaving Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoonParents Carole and Michael Middleton were unlikely to have been far away, famously supportive of the Duke and Duchess and their growing brood.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, too, could surely not have kept away from joining the first eager visitors, living just next door and both adoring children.The Prince once called George and Charlotte “the most amazing things ever”.The Queen, who was in Windsor, is unlikely to meet her sixth great-grandchild imminently, with further duties at the castle on Wednesday, while the Duke of Edinburgh is recuperating privately from a hip replacement operation.The Queen horse riding at Windsor on Monday before the latest Royal baby was bornThe Prince of Wales, who was on Tuesday travelling to France in time for a dawn service to commemorate the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux on Anzac Day, will pay his first visit to hold the baby on his return from duty.Other family members earlier remained tight-lipped about the baby\u0027s name. The Countess of Wessex, who was conducting a string of engagements near Truro, Cornwall, said during a visit to Tregolls School on Tuesday: “I’m thrilled for them all, it’s lovely - really good news.”Asked about the baby’s name, she added tactfully: “The jury’s out on that one. I don’t know, we’re all just going to have to wait and see.”Sophie, Countess of Wessex meets pupils during a visit to a school in Truro on TuesdayAs the outside world clamoured for details, the Duke and Duchess appeared to simply get on with life: with two older children, even with the help of a nanny, they could hardly do less.The Duke, sporting a light stubble, was seen driving out of Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoon, on an unidentified errand.Prince William leaves Kensington Palace by car on Tuesday afternoonOfficial celebrations were already under way, with the bells of Westminster Abbey ringing out from 1pm and gun salutes fired in London at 2pm.The soldiers, horses and Guns of The King\u0027s Troop Royal Horse Artillery rode out from Wellington Barracks into Hyde Park for a 41 round salute, and the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), the City of London\u0027s Army Reserve regiment, fired a 62-round Gun Salute from The Tower of London.Video: Moment royal birth was marked by gun salutesThe baby joy extended not just to the Royal Family and avid monarchists.A young politan Police constable, Tyler O\u0027Hare, who took centre stage during the Royal baby\u0027s first public appearance outside the Lindo Wing was also celebrating.Sharing pictures of himself sternly keeping them safe by standing guard, he wrote on Twitter: “An honour and utter privilege to have been the ‘Door Officer’ for the birth of Their Royal Highnesses new baby boy!“Today was an amazing day and a highlight of my career!”The official commemorative souvenirs marking the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s baby son have gone on sale - before the new prince\u0027s name had been announced.Featuring a lion cub and unicorn inspired by the Royal Arms, the Royal Collection china is decorated with gold ribbons, silver pompoms and a coronet-inspired pattern.The pieces bear the words Welcome to our new royal baby and display William and Kate\u0027s coronet.The range of official commemorative chinaware to celebrate the prince\u0026#39s birth The official range includes a pillbox costing £35, a tankard for £39 and a plate priced at £49.Each item in the range is gilded with 22-carat gold and made in Stoke-on-Trent using traditional methods.There is also a pram-shaped woven decoration, made with glistening threads, delicate pearl detail, and embroidered on the back with Royal Baby 2018, for £14.95.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyVirtual reality headsets are helping to fight opioid crisis in USWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

He felt like this would be a much better option.It is the start of birthday celebrations which is likely to involve a private party for family and friends around the actual date of November 14, and a new official portrait.The Prince is patron or president of more than 400 organisations, focusing on topics ranging from the environment to youth opportunity, food sustainability, architecture and faith.Among them is the Britannia Association, the alumni association for Britannia Royal Naval College, which has contacted members about a ticket ballot for the extremely attractive invitation.To coincide with the 70th Birthday of The Prince of Wales and with the gracious permission of The Queen, a reception is to be held in the gardens of Buckingham Palace to celebrate the work of His Royal Highness\u0027s Patronages, Charities and Military affiliations and others involved in public service, it told members.When the Duchess of Cornwall celebrated her 70th birthday last year, she too commemorated her key charities with a garden party at Clarence House.The Prince threw her a glamorous private party at Highgrove, she took on a new patronage to help combat loneliness in older people, and sat for an official photograph by Mario Testino.Please review our commenting policyVirtual reality headsets are helping to fight opioid crisis in USWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

The witness, who was a passenger in another car, filmed Patel as the car drove past.Witness accounts stated that traffic was heavy due to congestion and it has been estimated that the vehicle was travelling at approximately 40mph at the time.Footage of the incident was first posted on social media before it was reported to police and a Notice of Intended Prosecution was then sent to Patel in the post.He was later interviewed by officers at Stevenage Police Station, where he admitted that he knew what he had done was \u0027silly\u0027, but that the car was capable of something \u0027amazing\u0027 and that he was just the \u0027unlucky one who got caught\u0027.As part of the investigation, officers obtained a statement from a Tesla engineer who described autopilot as a \u0027suite of driver assistance features\u0027.They stated that these are hands-on features intended to provide assistance to a \u0027fully-attentive driver\u0027.Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) assists with acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle whilst Autosteer provides assistance with steering of the vehicle.Further literature provided by Tesla states that drivers should \u0027never depend on TACC to adequately slow down model S, always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death\u0027.Investigating officer PC Kirk Caldicutt, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: What Patel did was grossly irresponsible and could have easily ended in tragedy. He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day.History of TeslaThis case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar. I want to stress that they are in no way a substitute for a competent motorist in the driving seat who can react appropriately to the road ahead.I hope Patel uses his disqualification period to reflect on why he chose to make such a reckless decision on that day.In addition to his 18-month disqualification, Patel was given 100 hours unpaid work, ordered to carry out 10 days rehabilitation and pay £1,800 in costs to the Crown Prosecution Service.Virtual reality headsets are helping to fight opioid crisis in USWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We will see.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

It is terribly stressful,’ said Mullen. ‘All those barricades and boundaries were pulled down. I see it as a huge big exercise of trust and I do believe everyone breathed a sigh of relief’A bus stop and red post box stand in the border town of Jonesborough, Co ArmaghEarlier this week a cache of documents from the Northern Irish government were leaked, including a report on the Brexit negotiations written by two experts from Queen’s University Belfast.It asked whether avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – which the UK has committed to – would mean “backdoor access” for people into Britain.The experts concluded that keeping the border open would indeed mean “backdoor access … is inevitable”, a reality which may be pushing UK negotiators to build better access for EU citizens into their offer anyway.Avoiding a hard border in Ireland also has implications for customs arrangements between the EU and UK in the future, with Brussels adamant it must mean Northern Ireland, and possibly the whole UK, remaining in a customs union.Liam Fox says staying in a customs union would betray Brexit votersMs May’s publicly stated position, that she will take the UK out of any customs union, has been thrown into doubt after home secretary Amber Rudd said on Thursday that the cabinet was still deciding on the matter.Ahead of a meeting at which key ministers will discuss it this Wednesday, cabinet office minister David Lidington said: “We’re very clear that when we leave the European Union we leave the single market and the customs union, but the prime minister has also said that she wants a customs agreement with the European Union.”May ‘may have to bow to parliamentary pressure’ over customs unionTen days ago the government failed to prevent the House of Lords passing a motion that seeks to keep the UK in a customs union, while on Thursday the Commons approved a similar motion without a vote.During the debate, enough Conservative MPs backed the idea of a customs union to potentially defeat the government in a binding vote on the issue expected in coming weeks.But while the new offer on immigration would correlate with the more open Irish border the UK is committed to, and the implicated customs arrangements, it is yet to be approved by the cabinet.Anything which allows a high level of access or preferential treatment for EU citizens is likely to be viewed dimly by Brexiteer ministers like Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, who are seeking a cleaner break from Brussels.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

In his capacity as head of the CIA, Mr Pompeo travelled to North Korea to lay the groundwork for the high-stakes summit.While Mr Trump has heralded the opportunity for a deal to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, both Mr Bolton and Mr Pompeo have evinced scepticism about the sincerity of North Korea’s motives.In addition to helping prepare the North Korea summit, Mr Pompeo will help the White House navigate a crucial and fast-approaching deadline for the Iran nuclear deal.Mr Trump must decide by mid-May whether to continue lifting sanctions on Iran, as dictated by the pact. Both the president and Mr Pompeo have heaped disdain on the agreement, and Mr Trump said in January that he was agreeing to waive some sanctions “only in order to secure our European allies’ agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal”.“This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal”, Mr Trump said at the time.During a visit to Washington this week, French president Emmanuel Macron worked to persuade Donald Trump to preserve the deal.

The patent pump touched down on the shingle of history. One short waddle for man. But, perhaps, one giant leap into the international bantersphere.We cannot yet know the course on which the world was set, in that portentous moment under the April sun. The lamp of history never lights the path ahead. But the world is nonetheless a brighter place. A new star shines in the firmament. Two wide bottomed black puddings now bestride the narrow world. And the early indications are clear enough: Kim Jong-un is a massive banter lad.That the North Korean leader should have so terrorised neighbours far and near with wild threats of annihilation, and then nipped over the border for a spot of peace-treaty signing is already troubling the mercury on the bants-o-meter, but it’s clear there’s so more to come.Why presence of Kim\u0027s blushing sister could be so significantWhat pulled history back from the tempest of war to the shallows of peace is already a contested matter. Was it eight years of pressure from Obama to apply meaningful economic sanctions to their out-of-control neighbour? Was it Donald Trump calling him “rocketman” on Twitter? Was it that, in scenes Austin Powers didn’t even dare to dream up, his indoor nuclear testing facility now appears to have accidentally blown up the mountain inside which it was meant to be hidden?These are questions to be pored over by the analysts in the coming months, ideally on live TV, as their wives struggle to keep the children bursting in before bedtime like championship wrestlers.In the meantime, what can we know for certain?Well first of all, if you’re prepared to overlook long years of reports of death camps and public execution by anti-aircraft tank, it’s clear that this, the latest and perhaps the last in line of despotic Kim Jongs likes a laugh almost as much as he likes a snack.It had perhaps been imagined that it would peak with his dragging his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, back over to the dark side of the 38th parallel, for a handshake on his turf that was definitely not in the script, but the lols kept coming.We should celebrate peace in Korea but remain scepticalWhy presence of Kim\u0027s blushing sister could be so significantOff-script moment and missile jokes at Korean border summitKim Jong-un crosses into South Korea for historic meeting North and South prepare for historic Korea summitThe Korea peace talks wouldn\u0027t be happening without TrumpIn what were among the very first words he had ever been heard to say in public, he apologised to the South Korean president for “interrupting your early morning sleep”. At first this was assumed to mean with the various nuclear bombs he has been detonating inside his nearby mountain, but the truth was more prosaic. It was merely that his renegade actions had forced Moon Jae In to have to convene his own National Security Council every time, to discuss the growing likelihood of their own annihilation.Then there was the early morning jog, Kim Jong-style, which is to say, a short ride in a blacked out Mercedes, surrounded by 12 goons, jogging to keep up. At some point, someone may have to tell him, this is not how Keep Fit works.And then, as if nothing in the past 65 years of war had happened, the two men were sitting at a picnic table, set atop what can only be described as turquoise peace decking, chatting like two old friends who’d just bumped into one another in the park.It may be, in the coming months, the world suddenly doesn’t find it all quite so funny.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The couple had been expected to get married but split in October 2006.In a louche past life I was almost a member of the British Royal Family. In the early 2000s I dated Ella Windsor, the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, he wrote. For three surreal years Ella and I hung about Kensington Palace.

It stands for Duchess of Windsor, the former Wallis Simpson, whose affair with Edward VIII nearly destroyed the Royal Family.Princess Michael, of course, is never far from controversy.

Just look around you. We’ve had one for a while.And now the Government is trying to do something about it.Trouble is, it’s doing completely the WRONG thing.Acting on the advice of campaigners such as Jamie Oliver it plans to start clamping down on what it calls junk food.Under the proposals, buy one, get one free deals will be outlawed.That will make food a lot dearer for the poorest of us.Officials   may also extend the levy on sugary drinks. That will do the same thing.Another name for junk food is: “stuff middle class people don’t like very much”.And that’s the point. These nanny state initiatives always hurt the working class, not the middle classes.When they tried to stop us getting drunk all the time, they whacked a levy on cheap cider — not a bottle of Chablis.And yet alcoholism is just as bad within the better-off classes — just not as heavily reported.And now they’ve turned their attention to supposed junk food.But putting up the prices simply makes it harder for poor people to make ends meet.They are already suffering through low wages, partly the consequence of uncontrolled immigration.People, no matter how poor they are, know that it is not good to eat pizza every night of the week.Not many people do so. But the truth is that the food we eat today is no more fattening than the food we ate back in the 1970s, when everybody was as thin as a dieting whippet on Benzedrine.The real problem is a lack of exercise.People don’t get out any more. They don’t walk.They stay in their homes or drive their cars.Not so long ago the health lobbyists announced that everyone should do 40 minutes of walking per day because the results are so beneficial.But they had to reduce it to 20 minutes because everyone thought 40 minutes was way too onerous.A bit more education in our schools about the benefits of exercise wouldn’t go amiss.“Start Walking Or You’ll Die” would be a decent slogan.Might capture the interest.At the same time the health lobbyists also oppose what they call “fat-shaming”. And yet “fat-shaming” is a free, non-governmental means of persuading fat people not to be fat.I put on weight a few years back and it was only when my teenage son, in an argument, called me “a fat lardy-faced tosser” that I thought I ought to do something about it.Fat-shaming, you see — it works. If ­people think it’s OK to be fat they will stay fat.But leave our food alone. Don’t price the poorest of us out of the treats we all enjoy once in a while. And now I’m off for a walk because some of that weight has come back.How do I know? I told my wife I had a cut on my chin.And she looked at me and said: “Which one?”A GOVERNMENT ­scientist has been sacked for insulting his ­colleagues. He called one of them a “lardarse” and another a “f**kwit”.One bloke was the “Monster From Zagreb” while he was accused of calling another ­simply a “c**ksucker”. Top abuse! And I bet he had a point. The authorities wittered on about how he contravened their policies on bullying.Oh, spare us. If you can’t abuse your work ­colleagues, what fun is there in life?Another alleged insult was “vinegar t*ts”. I don’t know what it means, but I’m going to use it at every available opportunity.THERE are people out there who can show you racism in a handful of dust. They can ­conjure it up out of the air.They are usually idiots. Take the singer Raye, (nope, me neither) for example. She’s claimed a restaurant in London was “racist”.Her male friend, who is black, was refused entrance because of what he was wearing. Shorts and trainers.Listen love, that isn’t racism. That’s called a dress code. You want to eat in a posh restaurant? Then don’t dress like a toddler on his first trip to a paddling pool.Then there’s the BBC Proms. It’s in trouble for ­having cast a white woman to play the part of Maria in West Side Story.Maria is usually ­Hispanic. But if it’s OK to have a black actor playing ­Hamlet, why isn’t it OK to have a white woman ­playing Maria?The poor bloody actress, Sierra Boggess, has even been forced to apologise for having taken the part.And she’s pulled out.This shrieking obsession with race is divisive and stupid.This is to reflect the state’s “cultural ­identity”.If only the same thing would happen here . . . but don’t hold yer breath.THE Windrush fiasco has been hurtful to a generation of Caribbean people who came here, at our invitation, back between the 1940s and 1970s.It’s a genuine scandal. But look how the Lefties are trying to turn it into an assault on our immigration policies.Saying we must be less “hostile” to immigrants coming here now. Opening the borders.But the British public – including a majority of immigrants – still think there is far too much immigration to this country.And we are right to try to impose controls.As ever, never listen to the liberals.BRITISH students taking A levels were deeply confused by a mysterious object in the examination hall.It was circular, with numbers around the outside, and three hands pointing at the numbers. Teachers tried to explain to them: “It’s called a clock. You can tell the time by it. It will show you how long you have to go on your paper.”No use. The kids couldn’t make head nor tail of it. So it was replaced with a digital clock.Here’s the thing. If they’re so thick they can’t tell the time, why are they doing A levels?THE bookies reckon the most likely name for the new royal baby is “Arthur”.But there’s also heavy betting on James, Albert and Henry. All the usual suspects, then.However, you can get odds of 200-1 on the new prince being called Kanye and 150-1 on Barry, which I think would be good.My own choice, though, is Nobby.I’m CERTAIN that’s what they’re going to call it. Prince Nobby.Either that or Princey McPrinceface.THE reason we haven’t seen any aliens is because the gravity on their planets is too strong to let them get away.That’s the latest verdict from a bunch of scientists. They want to come see us, obvs.It’s just that every time they build a rocket it rises about six inches off the floor then comes crashing down, because of that gravity.Yeah, right.The reason we haven’t seen any aliens is because there aren’t any.None at all. No six-limbed purple-skinned blobs filled with methane and with sharp, serrated teeth. No grey creatures with weird black eyes.Nothing. Not even micro- scopic organisms.It’s a dead, lifeless void out there, a bit like the inside of Prince Andrew’s skull.ARROGANT knob of the week is referee Andre Marriner.He made a number of very puzzling decisions during the first half of the game between Millwall and Fulham.Then at half-time the Millwall boss Neil Harris mentioned them to him. “Oh,” said Marriner, “I thought I was excellent.”No doubt you did, Andre. I assume he says the same thing to his ­missus after sex.While I would guess she feels pretty much the same way as Harris did.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was early evening, and we were at a collective shelter in the outskirts of Damascus, waiting for the long lines of buses bringing these families to safety.There was a palpable sense of relief amongst those who were arriving. Many had spent months living in basements, hiding from constant attacks and only venturing out to get what little water and supplies they could find during lulls in the fighting.  Some of these basements were sheltering up to 200 people in humid, cold conditions with only one toilet to share. “We can finally see the sky,” a mother told me as she walked with her daughter, husband and elderly mother towards the room they had been assigned at the shelter. But for many of the 80,000 evacuees, getting here wasn’t straightforward. Eastern Ghouta is made up of several towns and villages under control of various factions that don’t always agree among themselves. For some families, this meant walking through areas where they were shot at or caught amidst fighting. Many only reached me and my colleagues after a journey that took many long hours – if not days. Our teams have been here since the displaced families started arriving at the shelters, making sure people have the water, sanitation, health and protection services they need. Many of these shelters had been identified just days before they were barely prepared to receive such a large number of people. The first weeks were very chaotic.Emergency toilets were being installed, water tanks hoisted on top of roofs, trucks of water and food were ready to be unloaded. There wasn’t enough space in the eight shelters, and some children got separated from their parents in the rush of fleeing from Eastern Ghouta. Aid workers were overwhelmed and limitations on movements between shelters made it hard to reunify families.But as tired and weary parents tried to figure out what to do next, children revelled in their new freedom. School-age girls and boys ran around the crowded shelters using anything and everything as a playground: bundles of blankets were re-purposed as horses or used as jungle gyms to climb on.  I was deeply relieved to hear happy shouts as they played. Last time I met children from Eastern Ghouta was in June 2016. Eastern Ghouta was still under siege and the UN was only able to access the area through convoys to bring in supplies.No child should ever face what those children were going through – violence, loss, deprivation, hunger.Rather than talking about favourite games and friends they told me about adult concerns: how expensive basic foods like bread had become because of the tightening siege (the years of siege meant that food supplies were hard to come by).In January this year, basic items like bread or rice cost ten times more in Eastern Ghouta than elsewhere in the country. But at the shelter, there was no more talk of hunger: “I had a sandwich this morning,” one boy told me, “Back home my mother would make us a soup out of wheat and sugar and that was the one meal we would have in a day.” Another girl asked me with disbelief whether I had seen the price of biscuits in the little shop in the shelter – five times cheaper than in Eastern Ghouta.During the siege, medical care was a huge challenge as well.In one of the shelters I met the mother of 13-year-old Ahmad. He was lying on a mattress at the corner of the room with his head and arm wrapped in bandages. Days before the humanitarian exits were opened, the building where Ahmad’s family lived was hit and the walls of their living room collapsed. Ahmad was under one of these walls. “If his father didn’t see his hand peeking out of the wall, we wouldn’t have found him at all,” says Ahmad’s mother.“There were no hospitals in East Ghouta,” she adds. “When we heard that we could leave, we carried Ahmad on our backs and he was taken to hospital when we arrived at the shelter.” We noticed that when children first arrived, they wouldn’t talk to other children if they were from different communities or towns years of fear and violence made them very weary of other communities. But now, children now participate in art, music or sports activities – forging new friendships to play, share and learn together. Amid the suffering that I witnessed, one thing that filled me with hope was that most school-aged children had at least learned some basic reading and writing skills.Even during the long months of hiding from the fighting in basements in Eastern Ghouta, mothers had set-up community circles for their children to continue learning.Twelve-year-old Shaima told me that for a while, before the schools closed completely because of the fighting, they would go to school at five in the morning and come back to the basements at eight – before the fighting would start. But now they are safe, mothers wanted to know when a school would open in the shelters, eager to ensure their children wouldn’t miss out on their education. Just last week, a school made up of 16 prefabricated classrooms opened its doors in one of the largest collective shelters. It can accommodate 6,000 children, but seats are filling up so fast and we are working to find more space for additional classrooms. As the weeks went by, half of the families in these shelters left to live with relatives in Damascus or Rural Damascus. But still many remain, either because they don’t have relatives they can live with or they want to wait to return to their own villages in Eastern Ghouta once it is safe to go back. These collective shelters - makeshift refuges which were never designed to be used as living quarters - are their homes for now and that’s why we need to keep supporting them. When I tell people that my job is to get children and families access to the essential services they need for their wellbeing, it’s hard for them to imagine what that really means. But when you’re on the ground with the children, you know that safe play spaces, protection services, good schools and healthcare are lifelines for their very survival.Children are the future of my country, Syria. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Love u to the moon and back”Grieving pal Rosie Yeats, from Irvine, north Ayrshire, said: “I can’t stop thinking about you.“You were the best friend anybody could ask for. I love you crazy girl Natalie Cormack.“May you rest in peace.”Zoe Horner, from Kilmarnock, added: “Can’t believe my eyes. Rest in peace Natalie.Thoughts are with your family. Will be sorely missed.”Another close friend said Natalie’s next-of-kin had been informed of her death.He said: “She was well known in Magaluf. She was a lovely girl.”Her body was recovered from a restaurant terrace in Martin Ros Garcia Street on the corner of Torrenova Street.The source said: “The entrance to the apartment block is on a seventh-floor passageway running between two buildings.“The spot she fell from is a sort of an overhang that runs along the side.“But it seems she did not have any keys when she arrived at her apartment and went to a friends flat. “She was climbing to her own balcony when she fell from the seventh floor. “We understand that she comes from Scotland and was working in a nearby bar but we dont have any more details yet.Detectives are trying to reconstruct the hours leading up to the resort workers death.Other residents and guests are being interviewed to try to find out what happened and when.A 24-year-old from Manchester became the first Magaluf balcony casualty on April 7.June is usually the worst month for balcony plunges in Magaluf."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000218240119.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"thousands of families set to get more benefits as government changes rules to universal credit","story":"The limit on child benefit will no longer apply to families who adopt children or look after relatives.The U-turn from the Government comes after a High Court judge ruled ministers were breaching human rights laws.Currently, a family can only claim cash for their first two children - not for the third or any more.But if a family with two children goes on to adopt another, they are entitled to an increase in benefits.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey announced that from now on, the same rule will apply to all families with adopted kids - even if they adopted a child first, then had a biological third child later.The rule change also apply to people who look after their relatives children.But it will not apply to stepchildren as long as they are still living with one of their biological parents.It will bring a boost of £231.67 per child for every Universal Credit claimant affected.Some parents could get even more if they qualify for top-up payments because of low earnings.Last week a judge ruled that the general two-child limit is legal despite a High Court challenge.But he said it was unfair that the exemption for adopted children only applies to certain families.Ms McVey said: Adoptive parents and non-parental carers - known as kinship carers - have often stepped in to help a family member or close friend in times of need. They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so. That is why today I am extending the existing support for children and families in these circumstances.Universal Credit is currently being rolled out across the country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000401535806.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd home office leak immigration removal targets briefed summer","story":"The Home Secretary resisted calls to quit, saying she is sorry for not being aware of documents.She had already told a committee of MPs on Wednesday that “we don’t have targets”.

I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t.“I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.”Last night she said she will be making a statement in the Commons on Monday in response to “legitimate questions that have arisen on targets and illegal migration”. Opposition parties called for Ms Rudd to go, saying her position had become “untenable” and accused her of misleading Parliament.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said yesterday: “She needs to accept responsibility and resign immediately”.But a Home Office source said Ms Rudd was “going nowhere”.And a Downing Street spokesman said she had the PM’s full confidence.The Windrush row came after it emerged migrants from Commonwealth countries who settled in the UK from the 1940s but could not prove they had lived here continuously were threatened with deportation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

smeeth","story":"Marc Wadsworth said he had received behind the scenes support from the Labour leaders office during his disciplinary hearing - a claim denied by sources close to Corbyn.Wadsworth had accused Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth of working hand in hand with the Daily  during a tirade at the launch of the Chakrabarti report on anti-Semitism in 2016.His expulsion followed a hearing by Labours disciplinary body which found his behaviour had been grossly detrimental to the party.But the veteran activist claimed Corbyn had told mutual friends he doesnt see that I did anything wrong.The Leader of the Opposition’s office disputed Wadsworths account and insisted no member of staff had called to offer him support.A source said a call was however made by a member of Labour staff to one of Mr Wadsworths supporters to reduce the risk of incidents outside the disciplinary hearing, which began on Wednesday.According to a Labour source, Wadsworth then made clear he was unhappy that Corbyn had not supported him or responded to attempts to contact him.Wadsworth hit out at the disciplinary process used against him and claimed he had been made a scapegoat.He said: The first letter I got, cancelling my membership summarily, was based on an alleged verbal attack on a member of the Parliamentary Labour Party which was uncomradely, brought the party into disrepute and embarrassed the leader.Well, the leader has told mutual friends he wasnt embarrassed because he doesnt see that I did anything wrong.Asked if Corbyns office had been supporting his case, Wadsworth said: When they called me on the first day of the hearing, they said to me that they had been working behind the scenes, that what I said wasnt anti-Semitic.He acknowledged Corbyn did have a bit of a go at me at the time of the incident and said perhaps I could have used kinder language.Asked who from the Labour leader’s team had been in touch with him on the first day of the disciplinary hearing, Wadsworth said: Im not going to get into names.Wadsworth said the claims against him changed from the verbal attack to one of anti-Semitism under the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) definition, which the party apparently had adopted later on, after, and were applying retrospectively.He claimed he had been the victim of a purge and said some people have called it a kangaroo court.Smeeth said she was relieved that the ordeal was over.Stoke-on-Trent North MP Smeeth said: Abuse, bullying and intimidation have no place in our movement, as todays announcement has proven.I hope that this decision represents the first step towards a return to the values of decency and respect throughout the Labour Party.Dozens of Labour MPs had marched in support of Jewish colleague Smeeth as she prepared to give evidence at Wadsworths disciplinary hearing this week.But Wadsworth accused the gang of white MPs of bullying behaviour, saying it was a crude attempt to influence the outcome of my hearing, and it seems to have had an effect.A Labour spokesman said: The National Constitutional Committee (NCC) of the Labour Party has found that two charges of a breach of the Labour Partys rule 2.1.8 by Marc Wadsworth have been proven.The NCC consequently determined that the sanction for this breach of Labour Party rules will be expulsion from membership."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000249301348.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"obese kids capital of england revealed where does your home

seat.The court heard that while the car was moving, he flicked on the flash motors autopilot function before hopping into the passenger seat.Patel admitted dangerous driving at St Albans Crown Court and has been banned from driving for 18 months after the daredevil move in his wifes car.In police interview the 39-year-old admitted to them that he knew what he had done was silly but the car was capable of something amazing and that he was just the unlucky one who got caught.As part of the investigation, officers obtained a statement from a Tesla engineer who described autopilot as a suite of driver assistance features.Further literature provided by Tesla states that drivers should never depend on TACC to adequately slow down model S, always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.PC Kirk Caldicutt, from the Road Policing Unit, said: What Patel did was grossly irresponsible and could have easily ended in tragedy. He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day.This case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar.I want to stress that they are in no way a substitute for a competent motorist in the driving seat who can react appropriately to the road ahead.As well as his 18-month disqualification, Patel was also given 100 hours unpaid work, ordered to carry out 10 days rehabilitation and pay £1,800 in costs to the Crown Prosecution Service.Patel of Alfreton Road, Nottingham, was sentenced at St Albans Crown Court after the incident that happened on M1, between junctions 8 and 9 near Hemel Hempstead, Beds."},{"url":null,"title":"james kate wright wedding mexico resort riviera maya building site","story":"James and Kate Wright fell in love with the Grand Sirenis Hotel when they visited it two years ago - and vowed to save enough money so they could become man and wife in the resort.The lovebirds splashed out £7,000 to make the journey - and other family members paid £9,000 to attend the sunshine ceremony.But when they arrived they found themselves stepping over piles of rubble - and piles of paint pots everywhere.Dad-of-one James, 39, said: “On our wedding day my partners dress was ruined due to walking through the building site, it really has been a holiday from hell.“We visited the Grand Sirenis on the Riviera Maya two years ago and had such a great time we wanted to return with our son and also close family for our wedding and honeymoon at the same resort.“From arrival there was just a catalogue of disasters.“The lift to our room was broken - but when we complained that we had my son and his pushchair we were again asked to pay for an upgrade.“The next day we discovered the settee was also broken and couldn’t be used.“But that wasn’t the end of our problems.“A couple of days later we were absolutely dumbstruck and shocked to see a large part of the resort turned into a complete building site.“Two large buildings were being shut and ripped out, the main pool by our accommodation was also shut off and drained with workmen chipping all the tiles on the pools interior. “This was the main pool with a swim up bar that we had seen in the brochures and online.”Our pictures show the dramatic difference between the TUI website pictures - and the Wright family’s reality.When James’ mum Sally, 64, later arrived she found her accomodation block was already under construction.The family, of Warwick, say they complained to the onsite TUI rep as well as head office and James’ mum and sister were offered a transfer to another resort - but because of the impending wedding James and Kate were not given the same option.Regardless of the problems the wedding went ahead as planned - but it was an experience marred by the ongoing construction work around them.James, a bar manager, added: “We endured the constant building works and the depressing surroundings, the constant brick dust and solvent smell has become an everyday occurrence.“I am quite sure that ABTA state any families should be informed of upcoming building works in hotels and resorts, we should have been told long before we travelled and had the option to change hotels or receive a full refund, this never happened.“The TUI reps said they had no idea of building works until they arrived at the hotel in the morning, there is now a sign stating about “maintenance” works, but this isn’t a scenario of fixing a lift or repainting walls… whole blocks of rooms are been ripped out and the main pool is simply a no go building site.“To call it maintenance is ridiculous.”The couple are due to fly home from their nightmare wedding today.A spokeswoman for TUI said: “We’re really sorry to hear of Mr Wright and Miss Wagstaff’s experience, especially given it was for such a special occasion.We rely on our partners in resort to advise us of any maintenance work and regrettably this did not happen of this occasion.

destinations as part of RailPlan20/20.Under the new timetables being rolled out by Govia Thameslink Railway across the network, space for 40,000 more passengers into London at peak times will be added next month which is a weekly capacity boost equivalent to the population of Bristol.Over 50 per cent of the trains will be extended to eight carriages throughout the day on the West London Line between East Croydon.There will also be more frequent services to and from Watford Junction in the morning and evening peaks to provide much-needed additional capacity.A new South London  network

weekdays and Saturdays and on Sundays, the half hourly frequency will be extended for more of the day.An additional evening peak train will be introduced from London Bridge to Uckfield on weekdays and earlier Sunday morning trains will be introduced on the Uckfield route.Reigate will see an improved peak and all-day train service, with a half hourly train service will be introduced featuring direct evening services and new Sunday service for the first time.A new all-day train service will be introduced from Merstham, Coulsdon South and Purley to London Victoria and on the West Coastway route, additional peak trains to London will be introduced.The new timetable has been developed from a ‘blank sheet of paper’, analysing issues and conflicts including stop times, turnaround times, and

will stop for longer.Many services currently have very short turnaround times at destination stations, so the slightest delay on the route means they don’t start their return journey on time and the delay multiplies so the new timetable has increased turnaround times to help ease this pressure.The vast majority of splitting and attaching of trains has been removed from the new timetable, meaning many trains will be kept in fixed formation instead, and services won’t have to wait for other sections of train to arrive and couple up and will travel at their full length throughout the day.You can
