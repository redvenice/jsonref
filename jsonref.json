I\u0027m so happy to be joining the natural immunity club. Going to have a nap.\u0027 There has been much debate about the effectiveness of ivermectin during the pandemic after it was hailed as vaccine sceptics as a miracle cure. The hype started early in the pandemic when ivermectin was shown to destroy the virus in lab studies. Several dozen trials have also indicated that the pills may have some value in the pandemic - either by using them on patients with Covid, or as a preventative.But, according to a BBC investigation last year, around a third of studies advocating ivermectin\u0027s use were seriously flawed or biased in some way, making the results unreliable. Reviews by health authorities in the US, UK and EU have found there is insufficient evidence for using the drug against Covid.The first double-blind, gold-standard clinical trial into ivermectin is currently being carried out in Oxford, as part of the PRINCIPLE trial.Definitive results on the drug are expected this year.  Currently in the UK, health watchdogs do not recommend any clinicians prescribe the drug but, as a safe and approved medicine, it can be obtained privately. Fox recently got engaged to prep school teacher Arabella Fleetwood Neagle, 28.Miss Fleetwood Neagle apparently supports his political campaigning as she was pictured alongside him on the top deck of his Reclaim Party\u0027s battle bus during his unsuccessful bid to become London Mayor last year.Fox – whose acting dynasty includes his father James and cousin Emilia – was dropped by his agent in 2020 after a string of social media comments.Last year he said he could remove his children from school over his opposition to the Covid vaccination programme.He said he would educate them at home rather than let them be vaccinated without his consent.Fox shares custody of his boys with Miss Piper, whom he orced in 2016.  "},{"url":null,"title":"NFL legend Tom Brady 44 says decided return Tampa Bay Bucs","story":"Share this articleTom Brady says he still hasn\u0027t made a decision on retirement - CBS NewsTom Brady’s contract makes potential retirement complicated for Buccaneers - The Boston Globe"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/08/16/3B2EB06B00000578-0-image-a-78_1481215945206.jpg","title":"Austria makes Covid vaccination COMPULSORY 18s today","story":"Share this articleThousands protest in Vienna against mandatory vaccination | Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands civil servants resist calls work office","story":"Share this articleFew signs of Whitehall returning to the office | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Covid vaccine rates SIX TIMES higher Chinese pupils Black Caribbeans data shows","story":"Share this articleDr Shamez Ladhani, a consultant paediatrician at the UK Health Security Agency and the study\u0027s chief investigator, said the data \u0027provides a real insight into attitudes towards vaccination – which has been proven to protect against hospitalisation and severe disease\u0027.He added: \u0027With Covid case rates currently high across school-age groups, it\u0027s vital that we monitor and evaluate measures that help reduce transmission.\u0027We need families and students to continue to take part in the programme.\u0027    The ONS team also found that Covid vaccine uptake increased with age, with 77.2 per cent of 17-year-olds having come forward for at least one jab.Children aged 12 had the lowest uptake, with 48.7 per cent having at least one injection.Just over half of 13-year-olds had received their first dose, while the figures for children aged 14 (54.1 per cent), 15 (56.4 per cent) and 16 (66.7 per cent) were slightly higher. Jabs were offered to 16 and 17-year-olds on August 15, while 12 to 15-year-olds could get their first dose five weeks later, which could explain some of this disparity. And the ONS noted that not all children in these age groups will be currently eligible for vaccination, such as if they have tested positive in the previous 12 weeks.The statisticians also found vaccination rates varied by region. Children in the South East were most likely to be jabbed, with 60.7 per cent of 12 to 15-year-olds having at least one dose. London has the lowest jab rates, at just 40.8 per cent.Vaccine uptake was also lower than the national average among pupils in Yorkshire and the Humber (51.8 per cent), the West Midlands (49.8 per cent) and the North West (48.8 per cent).  Deprivation levels also influenced how vaccinated youngsters are, according to the ONS data.In the wealthiest areas of the country, 70.3 per cent of 12 to 15-year-olds are vaccinated, while the uptake is nearly half this figure among those living in the poorest parts of the country (36.1 per cent). Students eligible for free school meals were also less likely to be vaccinated, as are children whose first language is not English.  Fiona Dawe, deputy director of wider surveillance studies at the ONS, said there are \u0027many different factors\u0027 contributing to vaccine rates including geography, deprivation and ethnicity.She said some of the disparity across the country may be down to different deprivation levels in different regions.It comes after ministers announced on Sunday that Covid jabs would be offered to vulnerable five to 11-year-olds in England, such as those with learning disabilities and diabetes. The UK\u0027s medicines watchdog approved a low dosage of the vaccine for the age group in December, after finding it was safe and effective. However, a questionnaire sent to more than 3,000 parents in England by the ONS found 24 per cent were unlikely to agree with their child getting the jab.Concerns about the side effects and wanting to see how effective it is in the age group were cited as the main reasons for parent hesitancy, the researchers said. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/066e0c1d89bf59b8d9f244bfb2cd3ff853d3fe0c/1083_337_4837_2903/master/4837.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ecd0ca18d99dab078e4fb0b5da83c917","title":"uk house prices 2022 cost of living stock markets manufacturing uk eurozone business live","story":"Factories have reported that output and employment grew at a faster rate last month, while inflation pressures became less intense. The IHS MarkitCIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) showed the output index rose to 54.5 in January - its highest since July 2021 - up from 53.6 in December. That’s stronger than an initial flash estimate of 53.8 released last month, indicating that the economy may have strengthened as Covid-19 cases fell back from record levels last month. The headline PMI, which measures activity across the sector, dipped to a four-month low of 57.3 in January from 57.9 in December. It was pulled down by a slowdown in new order growth, and faster deliveries from suppliers, as the strains on global supply chains eased (delays push up the PMI, as they typically show higher demand, rather than supply chain disruption). But, manufacturers did warn that raw material shortages, supplier capacity, transportation delays and difficulty in sourcing goods were still issues. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says: Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens, and is used by hospitals and nuclear power plants. A short government statement said a new deal would enable CF Fertiliser plant in Billingham, County Durham, to continue to operate. The plant was scheduled for potential shutdown this week after a three-month emergency deal brokered by the government came to an end on Monday. That deal was prompted by a crisis in CO2 supplies in late September as high energy prices combined with annual maintenance shutdowns to bring UK production to a near halt. UK food producers and brewers had warned there could be shortages of meat, beer and fizzy drinks, as well as higher prices, unless CO2 supplies were secured.  Here’s the full story: Virgin Money’s chief executive, David Duffy, told the City: The net interest margin is the difference between the rates at which Virgin Money raising money through deposits, and lends it out to borrowers. The potential job cuts emerged only a day after the UK’s biggest supermarket chain said it would be shutting its Jack’s discount chain, with the potential loss of about 130 jobs, and closing more of its deli and meat counters. Overnight stock replenishment will now be done during the day in 36 large stores and 49 convenience stores. At 36 stores, petrol stations will be converted to be “pay-at-pump only” overnight. Jason Tarry, the chief executive of Tesco’s UK and Irish business, said:  Despite the impact of the Omicron variant, the number of unemployed people fell by 185,000 in the euro area last month, and by 210,000 in the wider EU. Government spending programmes and job protection schemes, and the European Central Bank’s stimulus package, also supported the economy. Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for Economy, says the drop in unemployment shows the success of the ‘collective response’ to the crisis. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out there are still wide regional differences, despite the recovery. Staff at the UK’s financial watchdog have taken a step closer to striking over planned cuts to pay and conditions, following an indicative ballot in favour of industrial action, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports. It urged the FCA to come to the negotiating table and threatened to proceed to a full industrial action ballot unless a negotiated settlement is reached. Unite, which is not formally recognised by the FCA as its staff union, argues that the pay cuts, drawn up by the new chief executive Nikhil Rathi as part of a transformation plan, would damage the interests of savers, borrowers and businesses by creating a “bargain basement regulator”. The City watchdog plans to overhaul itself after scathing criticism over its handling of the London Capital \u0026amp Finance (LC\u0026ampF) investment scandal, which wiped out the savings of 11,600 investors. The FCA chair Charles Randell, a former Slaughter and May lawyer, is stepping down early from his post amid the turmoil. Unite said pay inequality was unusually high by the standards of public sector regulators, arguing that the FCA has around 40 executives who earn more than the prime minister. The union said the changes had sent morale among FCA staff plummeting and led to an exodus. An FCA spokesperson defended the planned changes, saying the regulator had held 77 meetings with staff: Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a fall of 6,000. Daniel Terzenbach, a senior official at the Labour Office, says: The Bank of England reports that approvals for house purchases, an indicator of future borrowing, rose to above 71,000 in December, up from 67,859 in November. That’s above the average in the year before the pandemic. It’s another sign that the housing market remained solid at the turn of the year, despite the end of the stamp duty holiday and the Omicron surge. Joshua Elash, director of property lender MT Finance, explains: The BoE’s data also shows consumers borrowed an extra £831m in credit last month, including £386m more on credit cards. That’s a little lower than the £1bn increase in November, showing that Omicron didn’t put a big dent in household borrowing. Adam Hoyes, assistant economist at Capital Economic, says: Household savings slowed in December, though. Around £2.7bn was deposited in banks and building societies, and £500m into National Savings and Investment accounts - much slower than the average monthly net flow of £10.6bn in the previous year. Factories fared well in the face of the omicron variant, says Maddie Walker, Accenture’s Industry X lead in the UK: Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that export growth remains modest, despite the improvement at supply chains: But price pressures remain at “stomach-churning levels”, he adds: Factories have reported that output and employment grew at a faster rate last month, while inflation pressures became less intense.

Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says: Data firm IHS Markit reports that production, new orders and employment all grew at a faster rate, alongside encouraging signs that supply chain issues are starting to abate. Its latest survey of purchasing managers across the euro area found that: Austria (whose economy shrank in the last quarter of 2021 during Covid-19 lockdowns) had the strongest-growing manufacturing sector in January, while faster expansions were also seen in the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland. Manufacturing growth in Spain was strong and unchanged from December, while slower improvements were seen for Italy, Greece and France. Input price inflation eased to a nine-month low, meaning costs rose at a slower rate. But firms took “a more aggressive approach to price setting”, with factory gate charges rising at a faster rate -- showing that inflationary pressures are still rippling through the economy.

He uses the quiet time to get some study done before starting on a two-hour and 40-minute journey by bus to college. Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland. He now lives with his wife – who is not permitted to work under her visa – and one of his children in Rathangan, Co Kildare, while the other child stays in Kenya.Wafula gets a monthly €1,500 scholarship stipend. He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"price of standard stamp to rise for second time in year to 1 25","story":"How the price of standard stamps has changed over the past two decades, beginning in 2002 (top left). Graphic: Paul ScottThe price of a standard stamp is to increase by 15 cent next month, bringing the total cost of posting a standard letter in the country to €1.25.It is the second price increase in less than a year, after it was raised by 10 cent to €1.10 at the end of May last year.An Post said in a statement that the rise reflects sharp transport, fuel and energy cost inflation and the true cost of maintaining a nationwide postal service with steadily falling traditional letter volumes.The price of a standard stamp has tripled in the last two decades, from 41 cent in 2002 to the new cost of €1.25 – a 205 per cent increase.The change, which will come into effect on March 1st, will also see the price of sending a letter abroad rise by 20 cent to €2.20.The price of a book of 10 stamps will remain unchanged at €11 until the end of the year, An Post said, representing a saving of 15 cent per stamp.SMEs can also avail of the €1.10 stamp price through the An Post advantage card with an increased discount of 12 per cent on larger stamp packs and a 34 per cent discount on parcel postage until year-end.Existing N (national) and W (worldwide) stamps will remain valid and fully usable after the new prices come into effect.The utility’s community focus supports, such as free postage to and from nursing homes and free newspaper delivery for older customers, will be available indefinitely, An Post said, adding that “check-ins” by postal delivery staff on older, vulnerable or isolated customers are now a “standard part” of the service.An Post said despite the latest price increase, the cost of stamps in Ireland is still “well below the current average European tariffs for high-quality letter delivery services”.The average price of a comparable national stamp across the principal EU14 (plus the UK) countries is now €1.58, while the comparable worldwide tariff is €2.27, it added.At the end of May last year, An Post raised the price of a national stamp by 10 cent to €1.10, while the cost of an international stamp rose from €1.70 to €2. However, the increase was originally intended to come into effect in February 2020 but was deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Inflation“International air freight prices have increased by up to 360 per cent in the pandemic transport cost inflation is running at 18 per cent and electricity, gas and fuel costs are up 27 per cent year on year,” the An Post statement said.“The new postal tariffs will help ensure the continuity of next-day national letter services based on customers paying the same price for delivery of letters nationwide regardless of distance, as well as ongoing investment in letter services, staff and infrastructure.”David McRedmond, chief executive of An Post, said the increases are essential to cover rising costs. “An Post is rebuilding the postal infrastructure for the future by developing new service and product choices to suit how we live now and how we will choose to live, work, communicate and connect in the future,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"reaction disappointment at return of traditional leaving cert","story":"Changes to the hybrid model Leaving Certificate in 2022 would be ‘an extremely disappointing decision’.

File photograph: John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union ombudsman accused the European Commission of maladministration on Friday for not disclosing text messages that the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, exchanged with Pfizer chief Albert Bourla to seal a Covid-19 vaccine deal.In an interview in April, Ms Von der Leyen revealed she had exchanged texts with Mr Bourla for a month when they were negotiating a vaccine contract for the bloc. But in response to a public access request by a journalist, the commission later said no record had been kept of such messages.“The narrow way in which this public access request was treated meant that no attempt was made to identify if any text messages existed,” said ombudsman Emily O’Reilly.“The ombudsman found that this amounted to maladministration,” the watchdog said in a statement, asking the commission to check again for the relevant messages and to reply to the recommendation by April 26th.“If text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents,” the ombudsman added.A spokesman for the commission later on Friday declined to comment about whether the texts had been cancelled and whether they were exchanged with a private or a professional telephone.He told journalists the EU executive would reply to the ombudsman by the deadline and noted EU rules required the commission to register documents, with no specific requirement to store text messages as long as they were not treated as documents.The ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding, but usually trigger heightened scrutiny from the European Parliament. “The European Commission has become less transparent, less accountable to the European Parliament and frankly more unhinged from European democracy,” said liberal Dutch MEP Sophia In ‘t Veld.The deal negotiated via text messages and calls, according to what Ms Von der Leyen herself said in an interview with the New York Times, was the biggest contract ever sealed for Covid-19 vaccines, with the EU committing to buy 900 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots, with an option to buy another 900 million.When the deal was formally announced in May, the EU had already secured hundreds of millions of vaccines from several drug-makers, including another 600 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech under two previous contracts with the two companies. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19

stacey","story":"A female banker who was shouted down by male colleagues with the catchphrase “not now Stacey” has won more than £2 million in compensation for sexual discrimination. Stacey Macken sued French bank BNP Paribas after being belittled by her boss, who used the phrase so often that colleagues copied it.The finance specialist, who earned £120,000 a year, claimed that over a four-year period, she received hundreds of thousands of pounds less than her male peers in salary and bonuses, adding that once she complained, managers targeted her with unfair treatment. Now, Miss Macken has won £2,081,449 in one of the largest awards ever made by a British tribunal.The London Central tribunal heard Miss Macken, 50, was hired by BNP Paribas in 2013. Unbeknown to her, a male recruit hired with the same job title and responsibilities was being paid £160,000.Within months of joining, she claimed that she was exposed to sexist behaviour involving one of her bosses in the prime brokerage team, Matt Pinnock. Georgina Chapman, his former PA, told a tribunal that a “large Halloween-style black witch’s hat” was left on Miss Macken’s desk after some of the team, including Mr Pinnock, had gone to the pub towards the end of the day. Ms Chapman said “they were visibly drunk” when they returned to the office that evening.The next morning, upon discovering the hat, Miss Macken asked Ms Chapman if she knew who had put it there.“I told her that I did not know, but I suspected it was one of the drunk team members, because they were the only people in that area of the office the evening before, which, combined with their drunkenness, made them most likely to have done it,” Ms Chapman said. “Stacey was visibly upset and confided in me that she felt really uncomfortable working with those male colleagues, knowing that one of them had purposefully gone out of their way to leave a witch’s hat on her desk.”Denis Pihan, another boss, was accused of routinely demeaning her by replying “not now, Stacey” when she tried to talk to him. Miss Macken made repeated internal complaints about her treatment, in particular relating to her pay and bonuses.Eventually, she took the bank to a tribunal, claiming more than £4 million in compensation and back pay.The tribunal heard that in her first four years, her male peer was paid more than £167,000 in bonuses compared to the £33,000 she received. The bank claimed it had hired her as a junior and that her male colleague deserved his higher salary because he was her senior.Miss Macken, from Fulham, south-west London, was successful in her claims of sex discrimination, victimisation, and unequal pay.The tribunal ruled that leaving a witch’s hat on her desk was an “inherently sexist act” and the regular use of “not now, Stacey” was branded a “demeaning comment”.At Miss Macken’s compensation hearing, Emma Burns, the employment judge, said that “Mr Pinnock and Mr Pihan behaved spitefully and vindictively” because she had raised concerns about her pay, and that they had a “discriminatory motive”.Mr Pihan “apologised for causing distress” at the tribunal, but “did not acknowledge that he personally discriminated against Miss Macken, nor did he apologise for discriminating against her”. The bank claimed it has now adopted a “detailed Gender Strategy and Gender Action Plan” in response to its poor gender pay gap and is “trying to increase the number of women at senior management level”.Miss Macken’s claims of harassment were dismissed and she lost a claim for damages over the “stigma” she suffered in this case. As part of her £2 million compensation fee, she received £51,400 to cover “pain and suffering” caused, £35,000 to cover injury to feelings, and £15,000 in “aggravated damages”. “We are pleased that the Tribunal recognised the seriousness with which we have taken its findings and the major steps forward we have made to try to ensure that nothing like this happens again.”More from NewsBoris Johnson scraps Brexit bonfire of EU red tape in favour of net-zero rulesSue Gray latest: Downing Street may never reveal if Boris Johnson or No 10 staff fined over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39Ukraine crisis latest: Vladimir Putin to give first public comments \u0026#39in weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39Major police operation\u0026#39 underway at school in HamburgChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"justin trudeaus woke agenda tearing canadian society apart","story":"After three generations of an official culture of political correctness in education and the media, Canada has become a strongly Left-leaning society. Six in 10 voters support the culturally Leftist Liberals and New Democratic Party (NDP) while 4 in 10 back the Tories or populist People’s Party of Canada (PPC). In many other western societies, such as Britain, the balance is far closer to 50-50.This gives Trudeau’s Liberals an incentive to tack to the woke Left on cultural issues to attract votes from the NDP while adopting a market-friendly economic approach to soothe business interests. When reports – which turned out to be false – of mass graves of indigenous schoolchildren surfaced, and Left-wing activists burned 30 churches in response, Trudeau called the actions “understandable” and did little to stop this attack on Catholic communities.Though their cause has only modest support, the truckers have tapped into the alienation of culturally conservative working-class Canadians from Trudeau and the cultural elite. As if on cue, the Canadian media has tried to portray the protest as racist, focusing on the extremists on its fringes. Trudeau has, without evidence, described anti-vaxxers as racist and misogynist while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh smeared the convoy as led by “those that claim the superiority of the white bloodline and equate Islam to a disease,” a complete fantasy.More from NewsBoris Johnson scraps Brexit bonfire of EU red tape in favour of net-zero rulesSue Gray latest: Downing Street may never reveal if Boris Johnson or No 10 staff fined over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39Ukraine crisis latest: Vladimir Putin to give first public comments \u0026#39in weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39Major police operation\u0026#39 underway at school in HamburgChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"see men objects","story":"Do you see presidents in peppers, houses that look like Hitler and the son of God in your sourdough? You’ve probably got face pareidolia – a scientific phenomenon in which illusory features appear in inanimate objects. According to new research, the brain is more likely to spot young male faces in objects than the physiognomy of older women – but is that down to social conditioning, hardwiring, or are our eyes not-so-secretly sexist?Susan Wardle, research fellow at the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, and the paper’s lead author, charted the responses of almost 4,000 people to everyday objects and found that illusory faces in inanimate objects are readily perceived to have a specific emotional expression, age, and gender. Participants were asked to state whether each item had a gender – and male faces were found four times as often as female ones. ‘This male bias could not be explained by pre-existing semantic or visual gender associations with the objects, or by visual features in the images,’ the paper found. ‘Cognitive bias’ was definitely at play, they added, but they are yet to discern how this occurs. One theory is that we more often see chaps in our chips as a result of ‘threat perception’ – where, historically speaking, assuming that a quickly-glimpsed face is male and a threat functions as a defence mechanism, alerting the viewer to the possibility of conflict. Then, there is the case that humans were exposed to more male faces during the earliest stages of development, further upping our likelihood of seeing them in lieu of female ones. ‘The origin of the bias – whether from social conditioning or from perceptual factors such as our visual diet of faces during development – remains an open question,’ according to researchers.Emotions were also frequently attached to the images participants were shown – leading to judgments of potatoes as listless, and handbags as sad. Dabblers in internet culture will know that finding faces in everyday objects – which research previously assumed was an early sign of psychosis – is nowadays grounds for going viral, with a smattering of social media accounts dedicated to sharing the best (one of which had several hundreds of thousands of followers until being suspended). From screaming plug sockets to sleepy pies, angry car bumpers and doleful bath taps, even the most vague approximation of facial features in unlikely places is enough to send online users into a tailspin. Primates do it too (though are probably less inclined to share their finds on the internet) a 2017 study found that animals such as the rhesus monkey experienced face pareidolia, poring over photos of illusory faces far longer than those without. “Face recognition is very important,” says Professor David Alais, psychology professor at the University of Sydney, adding that they are “detected incredibly fast. The brain seems to do this… using a kind of template-matching procedure, so if it sees an object that appears to have two eyes above a nose above a mouth, then it goes, ‘Oh, I’m seeing a face.’There seem to be certain faces we see more often – including that of Richard Nixon, whose resemblance to a range of vegetables, from peppers to aubergines, has proven catnip for the armchair pareidoliac. Jesus also has (typically food-based) form, showing up on toast and in the dregs of Marmite jars in crisps and banana skins, pancakes and potatoes. Elvis Presley is another common spot, making his presence known via cloud formations and ketchup-covered chips. Distinct features – such as pronounced jaws, a la the King and Nixon, or the messiah’s flowing locks - could be why certain faces seem to appear so frequently, though researchers have yet to investigate.As elsewhere in life (albeit a touch less importantly here) women are less likely to take centre stage. That’s not to say they’re completely absent from the ardent face pareidoliac’s findings, however: Whoopi Goldberg’s resemblance to a red onion has been documented, ditto an approximation of Mother Theresa and fellow nuns in cinnamon buns one jelly bean resembling the Duchess of Cambridge was listed on eBay at a starting bid of £596, while a toasted cheese sandwich ‘depicting’ the Virgin Mary sold on the same site for over £20,000. It’s a lot of dough for what was, at the point of purchase, a decade-old lunch – but the internet casino that bought it remained confident that this integral “part of pop culture” was worthy of the sum, and a subsequent world tour. Manna(chego) from heaven, perhaps, or plain madness more like.Still, there are more upsides to conjuring facial features where they may not be than not seeing them at all, Prof Alais suggests. “From an evolutionary perspective, it seems that the benefit of never missing a face far outweighs the errors where inanimate objects are seen as faces… when objects look compellingly face-like, it is more than an interpretation: they really are driving your brain’s face detection network.” Calculating the expressions of those faces is key, he adds, to determining whether “they are a friend or a foe.” Seeing the Cookie Monster in a loo-roll-hauling lorry or Donald Trump in a butter tub is central to survival: you heard it here first.More from NewsBoris Johnson scraps Brexit bonfire of EU red tape in favour of net-zero rulesSue Gray latest: Downing Street may never reveal if Boris Johnson or No 10 staff fined over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39Ukraine crisis latest: Vladimir Putin to give first public comments \u0026#39in weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39Major police operation\u0026#39 underway at school in HamburgChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tiktok phenomenon sees book sales skyrocket","story":"The rise of “BookTok” is driving teenagers and young adults into bookshops in numbers not seen since the Harry Potter years, according to the head of Waterstones.Sales of new books are booming after being recommended by influencers on TikTok, the social media app - but some classics are also becoming unlikely viral sensations.“These last three or four weeks in the United States, James Joyce’s Ulysses has been a significant seller because on TikTok the kids are getting excited about it,” said James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones and chief executive of the US chain Barnes \u0026amp Noble.The #BookTok hashtag has had 37.4 billion views and popular influencers tend to be young women, mostly recommending books by female authors.Mr Daunt said they were helping to make bookshops popular with young people, reminding him of the decade from 1997-2007 which saw publication of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series.“It is back to that kind of energy in our stores. Our challenge now is that we absolutely have to keep those customers, as we did with the Harry Potter generation. It stepped booksellers up and it stepped book sales up,” Mr Daunt told a bookselling conference in Italy, reported in The Bookseller.Waterstones runs its own TikTok account as a marketing tool and Mr Daunt explained: “It’s about fun and enjoyment and enthusiasm and the people who do it brilliantly are of the same generation - it’s our young booksellers and we let them get on with it.”He joked: “We have generally found that the people with blue hair do better than the people with sensible haircuts.”Barnes \u0026amp Noble has dedicated a section of its website to books recommended on TikTok. Even WH Smith groups some of its books under the tag “TikTok made me buy it!”Books that have benefited from the TikTok effect include The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Read, It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover and The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.Hoover’s book sold 21,000 copies on its release in 2016, but sales were reignited at the end of 2020 when TikTokers began posting about it. By summer 2021, according to Publishers Weekly, it had sold 450,000 copies.Sally Rooney’s Normal People and the Hanya Yanagihara novel A Little Life are also frequently recommended. The Barnes \u0026amp Noble list features classic titles The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights.The New York Times reported on the phenomenon with the headline “How Crying on TikTok Sells Books”, noting that tear-jerking novels were particularly popular. One of the most popular British “BookTok” stars is 22-year-old Abby Parker, who has amassed 428,000 followers.Often, Parker’s videos consist of her brandishing a book while a caption runs on screen and a soundtrack plays over it. Her recommendation for The Secret History, Donna Tartt’s 1992 bestseller, said simply: “No because never has an opening line hooked me faster. I’ve never been so excited to start a book.”Parker told Amazon last year: “I’ve always dreamed of sharing my love for books with the world and TikTok has finally been my gateway into doing just that. Getting completely involved with the book community this past year has been truly one of the greatest things I’ve ever done in my life.”The popularity of Ulysses, which many readers find to be impenetrable, is more difficult to explain. However, several TikTokers have introduced Joyce and his novels to a wider audience by discussing the racy letters he wrote to his wife, Nora.Joyce features in a video by Esme Louise James, an Australian PhD candidate who runs an irreverent account called Kinky History.More from NewsBoris Johnson scraps Brexit bonfire of EU red tape in favour of net-zero rulesSue Gray latest: Downing Street may never reveal if Boris Johnson or No 10 staff fined over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39Ukraine crisis latest: Vladimir Putin to give first public comments \u0026#39in weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39Major police operation\u0026#39 underway at school in HamburgChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid became free speech nightmare","story":"When a comedian promises to try harder after an ageing musician complains about their work, it’s rarely – if ever – headline news. Joe Rogan’s mournful Instagram video pledge to “try harder to get people with differing opinions on” his podcast after his “absolutely I get things wrong” mea culpa is possibly unique in the history of popular culture perhaps marking the moment we’ve passed through the looking glass on free speech and Covid.If that wasn’t thorny enough on its own, it comes as questions are being asked about how sensible an approach the BBC will take towards this week’s episode of Question Time, which will feature unvaccinated people in the audience, and as MPs are investigating the tactics of the government’s Nudge Unit after psychologists have questioned its “deploying fear, shame and scapegoating during the pandemic”.It is very difficult to know where to draw the line in discussions about disinformation and official information. If we were to say that all disinformation should be banned from major media sites, who decides? The World Health Organisation? Inidual governments? “It’s very problematic,” explains Martin Bright at Index on Censorship. “The musicians involved are perfectly within their rights to protest – where I become uncomfortable is when an ultimatum is set, forcing Spotify to choose between Joe Rogan and these musicians. As an open society we should, wherever possible, allow even the most uncomfortable debates to happen in as big a public arena as possible.”Since the start of the pandemic, however, there has been a surprising orthodoxy around the right thing to do, spearheaded in the UK by the likes of former Sage guru Neil Ferguson, and UK Health Security Agency chief executive Jenny Harries. Science has never been about unshakeable consensus – scientific theories are called theories for a reason. They are our best guess under the circumstances, but they could prove incorrect should further evidence emerge. The half life of Covid facts – the amount of time it takes before the majority of the knowledge we have is proved false – is uncertain, but from lockdown to masks and vaccines, credible dissenters have found themselves denied access to the airwaves and faced being smeared by the Twitter pundit and mainstream broadcaster alike.Oxford University professor Sunetra Gupta, who is so pro-vax that she’s part of a team that patented a new influenza vaccine a few months ago, knows this better than most. She fell foul of this orthodoxy as one of the primary authors of October 2020’s Great Barrington Declaration, which argued that protecting the vulnerable should replace a strategy of national lockdowns.“There is no moral imperative for consensus,” she says. “It is difficult to dismiss our viewpoint as being outrageous. Lockdowns and non-pharmacological interventions had huge uncertainty – we didn’t know what they would do to the spread of pandemic, but we did know they would cause economic harm to the poor and the young. Since then, the mainstream media and scientific journals have been actively engaged in publishing defamatory articles, saying we’d been bankrolled by the Koch brothers, and refusing us a right of reply. We are not on the BBC whilst the Zero Covid proponents are.”This response, Gupta found, meant that adherents to the wilder Covid theories – those who blame 5G, argue it was a Chinese Communist Party plot, that it was a scheme hatched by George Soros and Bill Gates to defeat Donald Trump, that it’s a Big Pharma plot and that, in fact, it doesn’t exist – ended up pushed into the same camp as an experienced epidemiologist like her. As a result, she found scientists who agreed with her research choosing to remain silent or even asking for their names to be taken off research papers.“It’s sad that we’ve ended up in coalition with some strange bedfellows,” she says. “I think that’s because we’ve lost the ability, as a civilised society, to accept that there is more than just a yesno answer to every question. In 1991 I was part of a team that published a paper on anti retrovirals urging caution – and the general climate was one of tolerance and different opinions being permitted. Today that is no longer the case.”Part of the problem, according to Dr Clare Birchall at King’s College London, who is researching Covid conspiracy theories, is that the general state of polarised debate means contrary views in any public debate are instantly politicised.“Lockdowns have created a coalition of distrust, drawing people together who would not normally share the same protest space,” she explains. “This means that views ranging from mild libertarianism to hardcore conspiracy theories become entwined and hard to disentangle.”Even as evidence for mask use has ided scientific communities, most nations opted to err on the side of caution – so although papers from as far back as 1997 show face masks are poor protectors against influenza, and a 2006 pandemic preparedness plan from the Canadian government did not recommend healthy iniduals use face masks, it has been hard to hear these positions argued in the mainstream media. Ferguson himself has admitted his doomsday predictions had been ‘oversimplified’ and “wrong” but lockdown fans – a curious concept – have not sought de-platforming.“Covid has put a huge strain on our instinct for free speech in this country,” Bright agrees. “Joe Rogan is prepared to have all sorts of conspiracy theorists on his programme – that’s part of his appeal. If you have someone who believes in UFOs or a flat earth, these discussions are harmless. Discussions about an international pandemic are of a different order. It is important to find ways of challenging inaccurate information in the public arena rather than closing all debate down.”As useful illustration of how this can backfire is known as the Streisand effect after the singer’s attempts in 2003 to get a photograph of her house removed from the California Costal Records Project saw downloads jump from six (including two by her lawyers) to 420,000.Some scholars argue that de-platforming doesn’t work, says Birchall “because it directs speakers towards unmoderated alternative online spaces or even private encrypted spaces. Many people say it’s better to have the conversation in the open to balance the risk to public health with the risk to public safety. Equally, we might think there is a problem with handing decisions about free speech to private companies like Facebook.”However deplatforming does, she adds, make it much harder for “conspiracy grifters like Alex Jones to make a living,” referencing the Infowars presenters huckstering of products like “Nano Silver toothpaste” and a “Superblue Silver Immune Gargle” as treatments for Covid.Certainly the gap in the mainstream media has allowed Rogan’s interviews to acquire an importance they don’t deserve – and has allowed celebrities like Russell Brand to take strong positions on the debates in his YouTube show.Rogan is emerging as a voice of reason in this debate – possibly prompted by Spotify’s cratering share price. “I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people’s perspectives so we can maybe find a better point of view,” his statement concluded.Bright believes that the long term picture is positive. “Covid has put a huge strain on our instinct for free speech in this country,” he says. “Because of the pluralism of our media you will find people who are sceptical in some media outlets and other media filled with people signed up to the government’s line. When we look back overall I think we will see that, despite the strains, the discussion of Covid lockdown has been for the most part an open and vibrant debate.”He cites discussions on the BBC about whether locking down students was the right way to proceed - as opposed to putting a ring of security around old people per the Barrington Declaration. In the maelstrom of Covid coverage, however, the brutal treatment of dissent on social media platforms suggests Twitter mobs still have the power to drive, for instance, Gupta away from the platform.Bright acknowledges the tensions but argues things haven’t reached the level of the trans debate or arguments about war crimes in Syria. Then he pauses thoughtfully and adds “I’m not sure if you should quote me but I think we’ve come through this.”More from NewsBoris Johnson scraps Brexit bonfire of EU red tape in favour of net-zero rulesSue Gray latest: Downing Street may never reveal if Boris Johnson or No 10 staff fined over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39Ukraine crisis latest: Vladimir Putin to give first public comments \u0026#39in weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39Major police operation\u0026#39 underway at school in HamburgChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"judge requests prince andrews former assistant testify civil","story":"The Judge presiding over the civil suit brought against the Duke of York has requested that the Prince’s former assistant, Robert Olney, give evidence.Prince Andrew is being sued by Virginia Giuffre, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with the Duke when she was 17 years old. The Duke of York denies all the allegations against him.Judge Lewis A Kaplan has written to the Senior Master of the Queen\u0027s Bench Division in an effort to get Mr Olney to testify regarding communication between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epsiten, Ghislaine Maxwell and Ms Giuffre as well as his travel to Epstein’s various properties.Last month, Ms Giuffre’s lawyers had requested Mr Olney’s testimony as well as one potential witness based in Britain.Judge Kaplan also wrote to the High Court requesting to hear the testimony of Shukri Walker, a UK based woman who claims to have seen the Duke and Ms Giuffre in Tramp nightclub in London in March 2001.Ms Giuffre’s husband Robert and her psychologist Dr Judith Lightfoot have also been asked to provide testimony.For his part, Mr Giuffre will be asked to discuss how he met his wife, any childhood trauma suffered, her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell as well as any occasions on which she mentioned the Duke of York.Dr Lightfoot will be asked to discuss any medical interactions she has had with Ms Giuffre as well as the theory of false memory.All four witnesses have been asked to finish giving testimony by April 29.More from NewsBoris Johnson scraps Brexit bonfire of EU red tape in favour of net-zero rulesSue Gray latest: Downing Street may never reveal if Boris Johnson or No 10 staff fined over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39Ukraine crisis latest: Vladimir Putin to give first public comments \u0026#39in weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39Major police operation\u0026#39 underway at school in HamburgChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sue gray report dissected what","story":"Sue Gray report dissected - what it REALLY reveals and means for Boris JohnsonSue Gray was unable to deliver her full verdict because of the ongoing police investigation into the Downing Street parties.

This blows apart Downing Street’s original defence there were no parties and the guidance was followed at all times.  Gray reveals the police are investigating  of these parties including a gathering in the Prime Minister’s private flat on November ,  and the Birthday Party for Mr Johnson on June , . This leaves open the possibility his we Carrie could be dragged into the police investigation. Johnson is also accused of misleading Parliament after he denied in the Commons on December  last year that a party had taken place on November  .  Here is what  Sue Gray said in her report… and what it really means: What the Gray report said:“We carried out interviews of over  iniduals, some more than once, and examined relevant documentary and digital information, such as emails Whatsapp messages text messages photographs and building entry and exit logs. This has also included searches of official records.” What it means:All of this information has been handed to the police who are investigating whether the parties broke lockdown rules. Scotland Yard today said it had been given more than  photos as part of the evidence compiled by Gray. If any of the pictures feature Johnson it could prove he was partying while the rest of the country was told to follow lockdown rules. Evenhe is cleared by the police, these images could see him damned in the court of public opinion.  What the Gray report said: “It is not for me to make a judgment on whether the criminal law has been broken that is properly a matter for law enforcement.” She later writes that because of the police investigation: “I have not made comment on whether inidual gatherings were in line with the relevant guidance and regulations in place at the time.”What it means:These were the only lines that proved helpful to Johnson. In his Commons statement, he hid behind these words to claim Gray had not reached a definitive conclusion and to urge MPs to wait until the police investigation. The Prime Minister is trying to buy time in the hope that public anger will have subsided when the police conclude their inquiries.  What the Gray report said: “The hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Government’s regulations and guidance rigorously are known only too well. Those challenges, however, also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health.”What it means:This blows apart the defence used by No  and some Tory MPs to excuse the parties. They had tried to claim that Downing Street was a unique building and its layout meant that work and downtime often collided. Supportive MPs said that staff and officials deserved a chance to unwind after working so hard during the pandemic. Gray does not buy this excuse. What the Gray report said: “Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the Government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is dficult to justy. “At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.What it means:This is as close as Gray gets to delivering a guilty verdict. The “serious” failure to “observe high standards” suggests that Covid rules were broken by the occupants of No  and there was no justication for what took place. Her comments demolish Downing Street’s claim that the guidance was followed at all times.  What the Gray report said: “At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear to the public. “There were failures of leadership and judgment by dferent parts of No  and the Cabinet Office at dferent times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.”What it means:This is the most damning part of the report. The criticism of the failure of leadership is a direct rebuke of Johnson. The fact that Gray concludes the events should not have been allowed to take place suggests they were against the law. The line “events should not have been allowed to develop as they did” reads like an admonishment of Johnson for failing to stop the parties and undermines his claim that nobody had told him the “bring you own booze” party might have been against the rules. What the Gray report said: “As a result of the politan Police’s investigations, and so as not to prejudice the police investigative process, they have told me that it would only be appropriate to make minimal reference to the gatherings on the dates they are investigating. “Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather.”What it means:Gray reveals she has uncovered far more than she is able to publish. As a result we do not know the names of the iniduals who attended the parties or whether they included the Prime Minister and people from outside Downing Street. We also don’t knowher final report will include photos and internal emails and WhatsApp messages. Johnson initially refused to commit to publishing the full Gray report once the police have finished their inquiries only to backtrack later. There will be a reason why he was so reluctant for the truth to come out.  What the Gray report said: “The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. “Steps must be taken to ensure that every Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.”What it means:Johnson has repeatedly claimed that he and No  staff were doing everything the could to help the country through the pandemic. Gray shows how that during this crucial time there was a drinking culture in Downing Street that had clearly got out of hand. Her comments again point to Johnson’s chaotic and free-wheeling approach to the job.  What the Gray report said: “Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so. “No member of staff should feel unable to report or challenge poor conduct where they witness it. There should be easier ways for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management chain.”What it means:Gray alludes to the fact that some people in No  did realise that the partying was inappropriate and possibly against the law. Her words suggest that they were too scared to speak up because of an intimidatory culture in No . This is will be seen as poor reflection of Johnson’s management at a time when he has been accused by a Tory MP of using ‘blackmail’ to get people to do his bidding.

It isnt Image: Getty ImagesopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsWell. The Prime Minister is under direct criminal investigation. The evidence of his alleged crimes are being kept hidden from him for fear of interference.And with war brewing on Europeaposs eastern flank, the PM told the enemy he didnapost have time to ring, because he had too much arse-covering to do.The Conservative Party is like an abused we with no other home to go to, and in two minds, not about whether this is acceptable, but whether itaposs survivable. And like every victim, it has yet to realisethataposs the question, then itaposs time to go.  Yesterday, a report he resisted ordering was not published. Instead, there was an aposupdateapos on the alleged criminality of his office, his staff, and his personal residence, and the PM greeted it in the same way he has every Mirror front page, ITV broadcast, and BBC breaking news update since late November: a burst of surprise and contrition with a half-le of . seconds, decaying into toxic belligerence that will linger in the bone for a thousand years. Events for which there was not enough evidence to merit an investigation by the politan Police had, in the space of a month, uncovered  witnesses,  photographs, and  pieces of paper.Despite the insufficient evidence,  out of  parties have met the evidential threshold for an investigation, on the grounds that those involved knew they were against the rules, there was no reasonable justication for them, and not looking into it would end Cressida Dickaposs career quicker than sending the riot squad into a candlelit vigil.One of them is an alleged gathering in the Downing Street flat on November , , which Mrs Johnsonaposs personal spokeswoman has repeatedly insisted is total nonsense, but about which there seems to be enough evidence to merit weeks of attention by an entire squad of coppers.  While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. One of them is Leshie Chandrapala. Her dad drove a bus. He died of Covid, and Leshie was not allowed to be with him as he lay in a coma in ICU. She believes he died because he didnapost get PPE at work, but the government hasnapost even written a letter of condolence to her family. A fortnight after he died, and while she grieved, they threw the BYO booze Downing Street garden party. The PMaposs response to the report was to say sorry for the way itaposs been handled, not sorry for doing it. And he has a solution. I know what the issue is, he declared. I get it, and I will fix it! He says he is taking personal charge, and setting up the Office of the Prime Minister. So who was in charge of his office for the past three years  Where is the drunken boozehound who careered around Downing Street Friday night drinkathons, encouraging staffers to let off steam with a long chug on the vodka bottle  Who allowed the culture of recklessness and lawlessness, at the heart of a government that was criminalising the same sins in others  Which leader has led his party to a disgrace worse than Windrush or Grenfell or Orgreave Bring me his head! bellows Boris from the Despatch Box. I will slay this beast, the same way that I would have slain Jimmy Savile,only I didnapost think that investigating historical sex abuse was money spaffed up the wall!Other things he has taken personal control of include Brexit, social care, test and trace, the energy crisis, the ministerial code of conduct, the saving of Owen Paterson, and funding for his gold wallpaper. The fact he took personal control of the vaccines may have something to do with the fact that  million people donapost want them. How many times has he taken charge, only for things to spin out of control  How many times has he shaken up the civil service, only to be rattled himself  Read more The nation is now watching the Conservative Party the same way as the rest of the street watches a victim get out of the police car, andto their abuser. They drag with them a whole country into this deranged, gnarled, unhappy misgovernment, back to the man who wonapost promise to publish the full truth in the House of Commons, where he might be held in contempthe failed to, but will promise it in the bar, to the MPs he has lied to for years, and who have been brainwashed into thinking such a promise is a concession rather than a repetition.Meanwhile the PM only appears in public when the public can be kept away from him. Abba tribute bands are raising their prices for satin satire. Andyou want a three-word slogan to describe where we are, it is simply: another fine mess. The PM or his we may get a fixed penalty notice pictures may or may not emerge. He may be out on his ear, or he may convince enough MPs to give him one more go. Itaposs irrelevant, because the fallout of this radioactive scandal will last to the ballot box and beyond it reaches into homes and hearts, to the guts and spines of millions to whom the words aposToryapos and aposPartyapos are now as repugnant as the fact that people like Leshie had their pain doubled and then dismissed by a man whose charm has long since been spent. The Tories got drunk on power, picked a man who can be fooled by a cake, and then dithered about whether to let him keep hurting the rest of us. They cannot see what the rest of us can: their party is over.

And Nicoles doing everything in her power to make sure she succeedsNicole and Penny have an incredibly close bond Image: Nicole GoldByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsNicole Gold knew her daughter Penny was destined for fame when she was just a toddler - slipping into her mum’s high heels and tottering around. “From the time she could toddle she was in my shoes,” Nicole, , told The Mirror. “She was picking up my microphones too.” Nicole, who records her own music and performs at festivals, had grand plans for her daughter from birth - getting Penny a baby acting agent at the age of three months old. “She did a Fairy commercial and a couple of campaigns and photoshoots when she was really young,” Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, explained. Surrounded by the commotion of a TV crew and set, Penny barely batted an eyelid - signalling she was meant to be in front of a camera. Reflecting on her own childhood, musical Nicole, from Colchester, Essex, regrets that she didn’t go to stage school at a young age - waiting until she was older to put herself through a performing arts course. “I’d have loved itmy parents had pushed me into stage school. It would have been a lot easier to get into it,” she said. So when the mum-of-one fell pregnant, she decided she was going to push her daughter into singing, acting and dancing to take up the opportunities she felt she missed out on as a kid.  Penny, now six, takes on around  hours of activities every week that will prepare her for a career in showbiz - meaning dedicated mum Nicole spends her week ferrying her daughter to and from classes. “It’s a juggling act,” Nicole said. “But I’m training her for what she wants to do.” Penny’s jam-packed week begins with gymnastics on Monday, followed by Latin Ballroom lessons on Tuesday, circus school on Wednesday, and performing arts and musical theatre school on Saturday. She wakes up at around .am every day and Nicole aims to have her in bed by .pm so she can get plenty of rest for the busy day ahead. To fund the array of extra-curricular activities Penny takes part in, Nicole runs her own beauty business - dropping Penny off at her grandma’s house on Fridays so she can see clients. In keeping with her glamorous education, Nicole homeschools Penny, giving her singing lessons using YouTube videos and practising reading by rehearsing scripts. “I try to make it fun. To be honest, kids learn more when everything’s fun so I try to make it more into a bit of a game,” Nicole explained. She added she’d always considered homeschooling Penny but decided to send her to school shortly before the pandemic began. Then, when schools closed and all parents were forced to homeschool their kids, Nicole thought it would be best to carry on home education after classrooms welcomed pupils back. Are you a apospushy parentapos  We would love to hear from you. Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.  “She loves it - she’s got more friends than when she went to normal school. Where we live there’s a massive homeschooling community,” Nicole said. As she teaches Penny more about le and fame, Nicole is starting to see her daughter’s natural talents as she excels. “I’d like her to go into music but I can see her acting more when she grows up. She has a right little flair for dferent characters.” Nicole acknowledges she’s a “pushy” mum but believes her approach to parenting will encourage Penny to follow her dream and give it her all. “First and foremost I want her to be happy and the best she can be. If her best means she doesn’t make it, then that’s ok - as long as she’s done everything to the best of her ability,” she explained. “If Penny decides one day that she wants to go and be a vet, that’s ok too, as long as she gives it %.” However, she reckons her daughter’s love of performing arts will continue to flourish and propel her to fame as she grows up.

The British Airways service from Aberdeen was filmed coming into to land at Heathrow as Storm Corrie whipped up the air with buffeting winds.In the footage the pilot appears to have everything under control as the large passenger jet edges closer to the tarmac. One wheel touches down onto the ground before the plane bounces up and onto the other side, causing the flying vehicle to lurch up and then down with force. Suddenly it tips right over onto its left wheel before the tail of the plane almost smashes into the runway. The nervy manoeuvre, which ended with the jet having to accelerate off into the air to circle around and make another landing attempt, elicited great excitement from the Big Jet TV cameraman who caught the rare aviation moment.  In the video, which has been viewed more than , times online, a man behind the lens can be heard shouting easy as the plane wobbles. Oh my god, Gilly, he yells in amazement as the jet takes off. The powerful winds of Storm Corrie on Sunday and Monday, which reached mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire, and Storm Malik the day before, didnapost just disrupt air travel. Tens of thousands of people were left without electricity and two people died. The Scottish Government said that of the , households that lost power as a result of both storms, all but around , were expected to be reconnected by Monday evening.  A nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire and a -year-old woman in Aberdeen lost their lives after the strong winds tore down trees on Saturday. Some schools in Aberdeenshire were either closed, or delayed opening on Monday, because of the disruption.  While the worst of the weather may be behind us, Tuesday is expected to be inclement for those in the north. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the northwest and northeast of Scotland and suggested winds could reach mph. It covers an area just north of Perth, including Aberdeen and Inverness. Central Tayside and Fe, Grampian, Highlands and Eileen Star and Orkney and Shetland are the regions that will be affected. It will be in place from am until pm. According to the Met Office it is likely there will be some short-term loss of power.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeBritish AirwaysWeatherPlanes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Doctors initially thought Lily Harding, from Macclesfield, who was aged nine at the time, was suffering with lockdown anxiety when she presented with vomiting in March . But mum, Toni Jenkins, persisted with GP and hospital visits, as she feared something was seriously wrong with her daughter. Scans later revealed that Lily in fact had a tumour in the left frontal lobe of her brain, which Toni described as the size of a aposlarge egg.apos After undergoing three major operations, as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital, Lily, who was described as a apostrue warriorapos was given the all clear in April . But in a heartbreaking turn of events, a three-month check up earlier this month revealed the cancer has now spread to her spine. Toni says she and her family are still coming to terms with the latest diagnosis, but have been left absolutely devastated. We’re obviously still in shock and absolutely heartbroken but trying to stay brave for Lily and focus on saving her le, she said. Lily was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in August  after several visits to her GP and hospital emergency departments. In January  she started being sick every morning and at the start of lockdown in March she was really bad, Toni said.The doctors at first thought it was anxiety because of coronavirus and lockdown. Then they thought it might be acid reflux.In August she was so bad that we took her to the hospital but she was sent home. We took her back the next morning because she was still sick and so they gave her a CT scan which showed a massive tumour in her left frontal lobe. It was about the size of a large egg. Toni said she and her family were overcome with shock after learning that Lilyaposs sickness was in fact cancer. We were absolutely devastated. Everything happened so fast, she said. The next day she was having surgery. We just had to stay strong for her. She couldn’t really have anyone in the hospital with her. She had to nominate two people but she has four parents as me and her dad are separated. Lily was just stuck on a ward and because of covid they didn’t have the normal entertainment. Despite it all though I want to say what a lovely, bright, happy, strong and brave little girl Lily is - she’s coped with everything like a true warrior. All the nurses adore her at the hospital even though she keeps them on their toes. She used to help the student nurses take her observations. By April , after three major brain surgeries and extensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, doctors told Lily and her family that she was effectively aposcancer free.apos She has had to go back for three-monthly scans which had remained clear until November. But the January scan showed the cancer had ed to the fluid in her spine, Toni said. She has a Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumourwhich is a cancer of the Central Nervous System and is extremely rare and aggressive. Lily has a couple of options left but the chances are very slim. We are doing research and trying to find other treatment options. Toni says she now wants to raise awareness of the symptoms of her daughteraposs cancer in the hope that other parents donapost go through the same trauma. She believes the family may need to consider alternative treatment options for Lily, which could cost thousands of pounds. If the option is that there is treatment we are going to need help raising the funds to take her, Toni said. A family friend set up a gofundme page when she was first diagnosed because we were hoping to take her to Disneyland but we still haven’t been able to do that because of covid. If holidays are no longer an option we just want to make sure she is happy and have the best time she can. Our community has been absolutely fantastic and very supportive. We’re not giving up and we will do absolutely anything we can to save our beautul daughter, the world will be a lot darker without her.

It was claimed he would have elite members of the Royal police squad acting as ball boys.But, speaking to The Sun Online, one ex-Royal cop, Paul Page, said thatthe Prince ordered him to fetch his balls he would “f****** knock him out”.Page protected the Royals for six years and confirmed previous reports of the Duke’s behaviour and said he’d seen it, but not been asked to do so himself.  He told the Sun: “If he had asked me to pick up his golf balls, Iaposd have f***ing knocked him out. Iaposm from the East End, I wouldnapost stand for that. He described the Duke as a “f***** a****** and a bully” who “treated his staff like s***”. Andrew is a keen golfer, but recently gave up his memberships of a number of prestigious golf clubs including The Royal and Ancient Club of St Andrews, where he’s been an honorary member since .  But now he faces a public civil lawsuit over sex abuse allegations. However, this is far from the first time that his behaviour towards staff has been called out. In Nigel Cawthorne’s  book ‘Prince Andrew: Epstein, Maxwell and the Palace’ he writes that an aide said: Iaposve seen him treat his staff in a shocking, appalling way. Heaposs been incredibly rude to his personal protection officers, literally throwing things on the ground and demanding they aposf***ing pick them upapos.  No social graces at all. Sure,youaposre a lady with blonde hair and big boobs, then I bet he is utterly charming. Only a few days ago, another allegation emerged where it was claimed Andrew shouted at a female gardener because he felt a tree had been cut wrongly. This came only days after being with his sex-abuse write by Virginia Giuffre. Page also told the Sun that Andrew would let Ghislaine Maxwell visit him at the Palace without signing her in, a signicant breach of Royal protocol. Speaking on ITV ’s ‘Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile’ Page said that Maxwell visited the Prince up to four times in a single day.Page said he suspected the pair “may have had an intimate relationship”. Page was jailed in  for his part in a £m property scam, he said: Iaposve admitted my crimes, and Iaposve served my time,. This all comes a few weeks after Andrew failed in his efforts to dismiss claims against him. Giuffre alleges that she was trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with the Royal. Andrew denies all the claims against him.

He wrote: Perhaps, I thought, they were wearing them against air pollution, which is bad at the moment. Or because it was a cold morning and they actively enjoyed the warmth of their foetid breath circulating inside the germy fabric  Or perhaps, I supposed, these masked ninnies were still so afraid of the now-harmless bug that they were prepared to endure the mild discomfort and inconvenience that comes with the illusion of security provided by a mask.  Or perhaps, in their post-pandemic health hysteria, they were hoping now to protect themselves against flu, measles, hepatitis ... even cancer  . While masks are no longer a legal requirement in England, there are still some settings where they are recommended. Londoners need to keep wearing them when using Transport for London services.  While London Mayor Sadiq Khanaposs demands are not enforceable by police and do not carry a fine, face masks will remain a condition of carriage on TfL services. That means you can be refused admission to a Tube or bus without one. Mr Khan urged the PM to rethink scrapping face masks altogether.He said: Wearing a face covering is one of the single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid- and the Government should rethink their plans.Some supermarkets will continue to either ask or suggest that shoppers wear a mask. Sainsbury’s and John Lewis said their customers will be asked to wear masks, though the latter acknowledged it will ultimately come down to “personal choice”.

Harry introduced his then girlfriend Meghan to his brother and Kate at Kensington Palace a few months into their relationship. However, the book claims Meghan was left disappointed when she realised Kate was, as Scobie and Durand put it,an extremely guarded person” with a tight-knit group of friends - which stopped the two women from getting friendly. Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends, the authors wrote.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Their relationship hadn’t progressed much since she was Harryaposs girlfriend. Meghan was disappointed that she and Kate hadnapost bonded over the position they shared, but she wasnapost losing sleep over it, the source added. But it was Meghan’s “adoration” of Kate’s daughter Charlotte that dfused the tension between the pair. During the early days of their relationship, Meghan lived with Harry at his Kensington Palace home, Nottingham Cottage. With Harry and Meghanaposs place just around the corner from the Cambridges, Meghan spent a lot of time with Charlotte and her brothers George and Louis in the beginning. This encouraged the Cambridges and Sussexes to put their dferences aside when the kids were around. Following this, Meghan gted Kate a soft leather Smythson notebook which brought them together, and the pair later attended Wimbledon together two years in a row. Speaking about the details in the book, Scobie told People: A lot of damage has been done. He also claims that Kate barely acknowledged Meghan during their final engagement as a four before the Sussexes quit the royal family. The book also focuses on tensions between Harry and William which arose after the Duke of Cambridge angered the Duke of Sussex with comments about Meghan. According to their sources, William said: Don’t feel like you need to rush this and take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, reports People magazine. They write: Harry was p***ed off. P***ed off that his brother would ask such a thing. Some felt it was an overreaction. But then, this totally sums them up as people—William the calm and rational one, and Harry, who can’t help but take things far too personally.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Deborah has now shared the note in a bid to shame the person responsible into coming forward. She said: Whoever posted this in my door, I donapost have a car so you are the idiot. Please come knock back on and get your stupid note back and talk to people face to face. Whoever this is for, leave your car where it is.  According to Deborah, the offending car was parked near the entrance of a cobbled back alleyway but wasnapost causing a major obstruction. The -year-old said: When I checked the entrance the car I guess the note was intended for was covering the entry slightly but not blocking it. Itaposs too narrow to park a car down there and itaposs only for bringing your bins out. It wasnapost that big of a deal anyway. I honestly think they should have left the note on the personaposs car. Either that or knocked on and asked meit was my car. I donapost drive at the moment so the fact they still posted it without correct knowledge shows immaturity. Itaposs a bit over the top for an adult and very childish. Iaposm more annoyed theyaposve assumed it was mine and posted such a vile note.  Mum-of-one Deborah explained that a note had been left on the windscreen of the same car around a month earlier. She added: I have seen notes left on cars around here countless times. There is another back alley entrance across the road too which is always blocked by cars as there is literally nowhere  for them to park. But theyaposve never had a note, yet this blue car seems to annoy them. Deborah admitted parking for homes around her area is a nightmare, with double yellow lines making it particularly dficult. The issue is exacerbated by staff, visitors and patients of the Royal Stoke University Hospital leaving their cars on the surrounding streets. She said: A lot of people donapost use their drives when they have them and we have a business which often has vans out front. We also get people from the houses further down which have no parking in front of them trying to park here. Itaposs like probably about  houses trying to park at the front or squeeze down Nelson Road. I think the council has double yellowed far too much of this road. The note was delivered to her address close in Hartshill Road, Hartshill, at around am on January .

Many feel he looks the spit of a young Mary of Teck, the UKaposs Queen consort from  to , MyLondon reports.The we of King George V also had prominent red hair and thereaposs no denying they have similar features. Some have pointed out online just how much the Duke of Sussex and his great-great-grandmother look very alike - and it has also been noted by royal experts.Speaking of the similarity between Prince Harry and Queen Mary when she was young in a post on twitter, one person branded them twins.  Others have pointed out there was no denying the likeness. Historian Rebecca Rideal said previously: You can see Queen Maryaposs facial features in our current Queen, her children and even Prince Harry. Prince Harry and Queen Mary are not the only ones where comparisons between their looks have been made. Prince Charles is often cited as the spitting image of Queen Victoriaaposs eldest son who became Edward VII in . And we could be getting to see Harry in the UK later this year, according to reports.He and we Meghan Markle could soonto Britain to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in a bid to boost their brand, it has been claimed. Her Majesty marks  years on the throne this summer, with celebrations set to take place over a special four-day bank holiday in June. Harry, , and Meghan, , are now living in Calornia with their children Archie and Lilibet after quitting royal duties in March .  A royal PR expert says it would actually be good for both of them to make time for the overseas reunion. Pauline Maclaran is a professor of marketing and consumer research at the School of Management at Royal Holloway and author of Royal Fever.She told thethe Sussexes need their connections within the royal family.I think it would add to the royal celebrations to have the element of ersity reclaimed that they seem to have lost through the sort of rupture of the relationship with Meghan, she said. I think it would be very good for the Sussex brand as well as they really need to maintain those sort of royal connections to really validate their brand, otherwise what are they. So because it might benefit them more than the actual Royal Family brand that might in fact encourage them to make a visit to top up their brand as it were with a little bit of royal shimmer and glimmer.

In an attempt to bust the myths of what actually goes on behind the doors of a mobile speed van, Go Safe Casualty Reduction Officer Gareth Thomas has revealed exactly how the cameras work.Speaking withNorth Wales Live , he said: I decided after retiring that I wanted to make theroadsas safe as they can be in this area.The aim of cameras is to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on our roads. Go Safe prefers to educate drivers rather than punish them with fines and penalty points. Gareth has answered a number of the most common questions surrounding speed cameras, which can hopefully keep you away from getting a fine. Is it true that speed vans have to be visible at all times No. There are no laws about visibility, so there is nothing stopping an officer operating in the dark. But they donapost often choose to do this, and maintain that being visible acts as a deterrent in its own right. Gareth said: Legally, we donapost have to be visible. I could camouflage myselfI wanted to - but itaposs all about being fair, education and preventing an accident. EvenI parked my van and went for a walk somewhere, it would deter people speeding right away. Can officers only catch motorists travelling in one direction  No. Any car that passes a Go Safe van is recorded on the officeraposs camera. Soyouaposre exceeding the speed limit whether youaposre driving in the same or opposite direction to the van, you can expect a speeding ticket.  It is true that the  per cent rule exists  Yes. You will not get a ticket provided your speed does not exceed the limit by more than  per cent, plus mph on roads, Gareth says. So for example, travelling at mph or above in a mph zone will be recorded as a speeding offence. However, Go Safe say thresholds y and can change without notice. Officially, any speeding offence occurs at mph above the limit, but most forces will allow a iance. Are officers a revenue collector for the Government  No. Gareth, explained: Weaposre not here to get figures or to make money. Weaposre just here to catch the people who are speeding. If I get a day where I donapost get any drivers speeding, then I know Iaposve done my job. If Iaposve been working an eight hour sht, I just hope at least one person that day has escaped injury or a crash has been avoided. Can I get caught speeding more than once on the same day by the same camera  The current position with Go Safe is thatyou are caught twice in  minutes, it will be treated as one offence. In theory, a driver with a previously clean licence could be caught several times on the same day - and as a result be at risk of disqualication under the totting-up system.If you are caught speeding several times on the same journey and accept a fixed penalty for each, you could be at risk of a penalty points disqualication . Is it illegal to obstruct a vans view of the road  Yes. Obstructing a GoSafe vans field of view during its operational duties is an offence and you can be prosecuted for it. Do officers enforce anything other than speeding  Yes. Officers are there to make sure you are wearing a seat-belt and are not using your mobile phones behind the wheel. Anyone caught breaking these laws will be prosecuted. This is the reason why you sometimes see a GoSafe speed van in an area where there are already permanent speed cameras.  Is it illegal to flash your headlights to alert motorists of a GoSafe speed van  If drivers choose to flash to warn others about a speed van, they could be in breach of the law. Under section  of the Police Act  it is an offence to wilfully obstruct a constable in the execution of his her duty. However, Gareth says while it is an offence, it is very dficult to prove. He said: It doesnapost bother me that people flash to warn them of the speed van - I just want to educate people and the van to act as a speed deterrent. How long do GoSafe speed vans tend to stay at one particular spot  For technical reasons, a speed van will only remain in a certain spot for  minutes, Gareth said. During his average eight hour sht, he will normally visit three dferent spots across the region where he has been ordered to visit. Who decides where GoSafe speed vans park up  Enforcement is usually carried out in certain areas for a number of reasons, including: Death or serious injury has occurred at the location. Speeds in the area have been recorded as signicantly high. Speeding concerns have been raised by residents and those concerns have been corroborated by a traffic speed survey. Go Safe are supporting a police enforcement campaign What happensI am caught speeding  It all comes down to the circumstances within which you were caught speeding, and how much you were in excess of the limit.  The minimum penalty for being caught speeding on the UKaposs roads is a £ fine. But Gareth explained in some circumstances, police can offer the option of attending a speed awareness course - an alternative to a fine and penalty points. Gareth, said: An accredited course is far more likely to improve driver behaviour and consequently make our roads safer. Courses are available to drivers who respond quickly to the aposnoticesapos and who were driving at no more than  per cent, plus  mph above the posted speed limit.So for example, anyone travelling over mph on a motorway would not be offered the awareness course.Those who donapost have a clean licence at the time of the office, oryou have been on the course in the last three years, it is unlikely you will be offered the awareness course as an option.

Following the birth of her triplets, Charity Horton,  believed her we was plotting with her mother-in-law and planned to drug her during the horrying ordeal.

She said: “It was like I’d gone schizophrenic overnight. Even when I started sleeping I was obsessing over things.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here I kept thinking people were testing me to seeI could cope. I thought my we and her mother were watching me on the baby monitor to seeI made mistakes. “I thought they were hiding my medicine so they could drug me to make me stop talking. I was obsessively askingit was time to feed the babies, and how much they would need at their next feed, just repeating the same questions over and over. “Then all the hallucinating and obsessing about birds in the garden started. If I saw only one magpie in the garden I would obsess that something bad was going to happen to the babies, and Iaposd chase around the garden trying to find all its friends. “I’d be really gladI saw a robin in the garden and follow it about because when my we sees a robin she says it’s her dad who died, but I obsessed over them.  “I had a hallucination of my we carrying a bag down the side of our house, but I can’t have seen that, because I was sitting on the sofa with a wall in front of me. “I did a similar thing with my friend’s car, which I thought I saw, but it wasn’t there when I looked again.” Charity became pregnant following articial insemination in August , and along with we Sarah, an HGV driver was over the moon. The wives used a sperm donor from Denmark, and Charity had intra-uterine injections because of suspected polycystic oies she said. The mums-to-be were delighted when three little ones were spotted on the seven-week scan: each with their own amniotic sack and placenta, on March , .The babes, each weighing four pounds, were born by planned caesarean section after a -week uncomplicated pregnancy. The girls were strong enough to stay in the main hospital with mum, resting in special hot-cots, and fed via nasal-gastro tubes. The new mums cuddled and burped their tots, and changed many tiny nappies, before bringing their family home on April . But Charity Horton, , struggled to relax after babies Raine, Poppy and River were born, and once she got home from hospital barely slept for an entire week. Soon she became very ill and was convinced she was starving her tiny babies - even though the trio were perfectly healthy. And she believed her mother-in-law Cheryl Horton, , and we were hiding her medication, and that Cherylaposs dog was going to eat the babies. In the following weeks, her mental health spiralled, and she started to hallucinate thinking she could see through the walls. Convinced that magpies in her garden were a sign of bad luck, sheaposd chase them out the garden of their home in St Austell, Cornwall. Doctors initially prescribed the exhausted mum antidepressants and sleeping pills, but the depleted woman couldn’t find peace. Frightened Charity began to self-harm and take risks with her le. The troubled mum once tried to put her foot in scalding water to seeshe could feel the pain.  In a cry for help, she told her we she was going to take her own le, and disappeared, on April . Loved-ones including mum Joy Ternouth , was worried sick, she said. The family called the mental-health nurses and Charity, who ed home the same night, was admitted to Longreach mental health acute psychiatric ward on April . The mum was given support and a six-month course of antipsychotic drugs and was well enough tohome to her we and babies on May . After two weeks of in-patient treatment, she was on the road to recovery and able tohome. She spoke up about her experience to help other mums going through the same thing. Charity, a CCTV manager, said: “At first I didnapost think there was anything wrong I just thought I was high on le after having these three beautul girls. “Then we got home and I was so frightened of having to look after them. I was sure I was doing it wrong. “I convinced myself I had to feed them all at once. I couldn’t switch off or sleep at all. It was like I was wired. I could hear them all the time, and they always sounded really loud. “I feared they would die in their sleep, so when they were quiet I thought they were dead. Whenever they were awake I thought they needed something all the time. “I didn’t stop talking, I just kept repeating the same questions to my we and her mum all the time. It just got worse and worse, until I wanted to kill myself because I was in so much pain. “I just wanted the anxiety to stop. Looking back now it seems so scary. I just canapost believe that happened. It’s brilliant being a new mum now - I love it. “I’m really embracing it and making up for the lost time. I just laugh and play with them a lot and get them to smile. I’m so glad Iaposve got through it. “At leastmy girls go through mental health problems I’ll know how to help.” After a month, brave Charity confessed she was having thoughts about self-harm and was admitted to hospital, where she was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. She said: I knew there was something wrong but not what it was.  “I desperately needed help. I threatened to hurt and then kill myself because I was hoping somebody would realise that I wasnapost me and that I was in this horrible place. “I just wanted to feel like myself again. I was glad to pack my bags - it was the right place for me. “I was too in my own head to worry about leaving the babies, I just need to get better. “After nine days I started really missing them so I knew I was getting better. They’re not quite sure why postpartum psychosis happens, about one in a thousand women get it, and it’s triggered by birth. “I imagine it’s the perfect storm of all the hormones of being a new mum, the stress, and being so tired. It’s a medical emergency -somebody gets it you need to ring an ambulance it’s that bad. “It’s rare, but be on the lookout for your family and friends just be aware of what can happen. One minute you seem fine but the next you don’t know what’s going on.” If you are suffering from postnatal depression, donapost struggle in silence. PANDAS is a charity dedicated to helping people.

Cherie Hitchens, , and Joanna Morrison, , have been living in temporary accommodation for a year.They both have multiple disabilities including multiple chemical sensitivity, making them extremely sensitive to any chemical-type smells, DorsetLive reports. Dorset Council said the only permanent accommodation it could offer them was a bungalow just one mile from the Lush soap factor. Cherie and Joanna said they had no choice but to turn it down, leaving them homeless. Cherie said: They evicted us because we said no to one permanent bungalow in Upton.  We said no to that because it was right next to the carriageway, there were lots of Lush smells, lots of people working for Lush - we are allergic to scented products, they make us very ill. Also the problem with the bungalow was they saidwe didnapost stay there for five years, we would have to pay for all the disabled adaptions. In , the pair had been living in Upton. They are part-time wheelchair users, with Joanna suffering from asthma and diabetes. Cherie also suffers from spinal stenosis, Graves Disease and has recently recovered from cancer. That year, when their council-funded home became unavailable they were moved into a hotel and from there they were moved to a temporary house for a year. They were then offered a new bungalow, but the two friends said it was unsuitable. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Cherie said: We had to do an assessment, of their opinion and our opinion of why we couldnapost take the bungalow in Upton. We did that. They [the council] said you should have taken it. We looked in Devon, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Cornwall, and Dorset obviously, to start with. Theyaposre throwing us out of Dorset. We canapost go to places that have very well-known scented product shops and factories - we canapost go near them, and they are all over the place. We did look at three properties out of a lot that I saw. Three of them we wanted, but one landlord said: aposno, housing benefitapos. They believe whataposs on the TV - that weaposre all scum and weaposre just milking the system. We are not. Itaposs not our fault we had these accidents - itaposs not our fault we have to rely on benefits. Weaposre relying on credit cards now - Iaposm almost maxed out. Cherie claims they went through the courts, but the council has stopped all forms of help. She says they were evicted from their temporary home on January . The pair are now staying in a hotel for as long as they can afford to, which they expect will be until Tuesday. Cherie said: Theyaposre expecting us to sofa-surf, theyaposre expecting us to have friends and family. But they use scented products! We used to use scented products - we used to have lovely incense sticks, you know  We couldnapost live there. [Joannaaposs] suffered enough. Sheaposs nearly  years old - she doesnapost deserve this, we donapost deserve this. No disabled person deserves this - the way we are being treated. When asked what she felt needed to be done, Cherie said: Weaposve looked for a three-bedroom, detached bungalow, with a wet room, with a garage, no wood burners, no VOC paint, not newly refurbished, no new carpets and not near carriageways, factories or industrial estates. Thataposs what we want. Itaposs not easy - of course, weaposre part-time wheelchair users, and Iaposm going to be paralysed in a few years because of my narrowing of the spinal cord. Cherie said: Jo has to see the specialist, sheaposs got another condition, and she has not been able to see them for six months. So we cannot move out of Dorset until she sees them. So weaposve got to stay here until February . There are other counties that offer three, four, five properties. We were only offered one. We didnapost know that! They never said to us,you donapost accept it, then you are going to be on the streets. She added that the situation has taken a toll on their mental health. A spokesman for Dorset Council said: “The council is unable to go into detail on inidual cases. “However, there is a very clear legal procedure the council has to follow in offering residents a suitable property. “The consequences of refusing to accept a property, which is deemed suitable, are clearly communicated in writing and verbally. “Decisions can also be reviewed and go through the court system. The council also has an obligation to use temporary accommodation in the best way possible for all residents.” Thecontacted Dorset Council for comment.

More than , homes were without electricity following back-to-back storms which hit the UK over the weekend and cost three people their lives. Storm Corrie brought winds of mph to Stornoway in the Western Isles of Scotland late on Sunday. It came after Storm Malik blew down trees, damaged power lines and ripped roofs off homes in the north of England and Scotland on Saturday.Now more stormy weather is predicted with a Met Office yellow warning in place for the north and east of Scotland. It states: “Strong winds on Tuesday may lead to some disruption.” Adding people can expect: “Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. “Probably some bus and train services affected with some journeys taking longer. It’s possible that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and or large waves.” Met Office Alex Deakin said that it is set to be cloudy and wet day with the strong winds on Tuesday but temperatures are expected to be mild.  He said: A grey day for England and Wales with outbreaks of rain across the North West some brighter skies across Scotland, some sunshine coming through. It is going to be windy across the North East, gusts of mph over the mainland maybe a little bit more than that across the far North East and of course after those recent storms there is the potential for further disruption so we do have a yellow warning in place across the north east of Scotland.” Temperatures are expected to remain relatively mild through the middle of the week before an Arctic plunge caused by a cold front sweeping in bringing snow on Friday for Scotland and temperatures as low as -C over the weekend.

UK forecast for the next  days Today: Cloudy and mild for most parts with some patchy light rain and drizzle. Brighter weather moving south across Scotland, northern and eastern England, whilst wintry showers affect the far northeast. Windy, with severe gales for northeast Scotland. Tonight: Showers and winds in the far northeast easing, then turning clear and chilly for a time. Cloud, rain and drizzle in the west moving eastwards later. Wednesday: Cloudy for many with some patchy light rain and drizzle moving eastwards, then some heavier rain in the far northwest later. Brighter across the south. Mild and breezy. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Squally rain sweeping southeast Thursday, with sunshine and wintry showers to follow. Milder at first over the weekend but with more squally rain and showers following later. Windy throughout.

Whitney Paige Venable, from Florida, was mortied during the exchange at the Orlando theme park, and believes the request came due to people feeling uncomfortable about her naturally large breasts.The -year-old, who has previously suffered discrimination for her curvy shape, claims that an employee informed her that she would have to cover up her cleavageshe wanted to be let into the park. Whitney was wearing a white crop top and mint green shorts at the time of the incident, which took place in June , and she claims many other women were wearing similar outfits. I felt humiliated and embarrassed. I was told I had to change my top to be able to enter. I think itaposs because I have naturally big breasts and it makes people uncomfortable but at far as I know my clothing wasnapost against the rules, she said. I feel like I was discriminated against because of the size of my breasts. I noticed other people staring and I felt really embarrassed. It was humiliating. Whitney and her pal filmed themselves as they excitedly waited to go into the theme park, but moments later, film shows them standing at the entrance being told the modelaposs outfit was inappropriate. In the clip, she can be heard saying: So, I guess my top is inappropriate for Universal, weaposre having a problem right now. So apparently I have to go change into a more appropriate top even though Iaposve seen a lot of people here in sports bra-looking tops. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Looking back a the incident several month later, the model said: I felt like I was being targeted and it was the summer so it was hot, I didnapost really understand [the issue] but having natural large breast brings attention. I ended up putting on another top over the sports bra, my friend had another top in the car. But I ended up taking it off later on in the park because it was hot and ugly and the fact I was judged really pi**ed me off. Smaller women can wear whatever they want – having big breasts however gets sexualised.This isnapost the first time the model has hit the headlines due to her looks. Last year, Whitney claims she was banned on Twitter for being too hot with people reporting her saucy snaps because they are jealous of her beauty.One day, I changed my cover photo to an innocent shot of me showing off my figure – but I was wearing underwear. And suddenly, my account was banned. It made me feel discriminated against because there are far worse pictures on Twitter. Some of them look like actual p*rn showing off really graphic angles. I’m sure thatI wasn’t so good-looking the photo would have stayed up. I firmly believe Twitter deleted my account because I’m too hot and jealous people who aren’t as attractive complained or said I was promoting sexual activity. Itaposs not fair.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Sara assumed it was a simple mix up, so she called the delivery driver in the hopes they could easily swap the wrong half for the right colour, but she was gobsmacked when he told her it was not a mistake and she would have to take it up with Argos. When the mental health worker flagged the mismatched mistake to Argos, she claims she was told she could keep it,it or pay to upgrade to another model but would have to pay the dference. Sara, from Swansea, said: Iaposm still stuck upstairs because of this, Iaposm so angry. You couldnapost make it up, itaposs just a complete shambles. We phoned the delivery guy back and said aposwe think you have made a mistake and the other half of our sofa is in your vanapos. He said it would have to go through Argos - even though it was just  minutes since he left. I felt very frustrated as he had only just left. Iaposm still stuck upstairs because of this, Iaposm so angry. You couldnapost make it up, itaposs just a complete shambles.

The mum-of-one said she was offered an insulting £ compensation for their troubles, but has now been left stuck upstairs nursing and caring for three-week-old Arthur Hudgell, as she doesnapost want to mark the sofa before itaposs collected. Argos said Saraaposs experience did aposnot meet their usual high standardsapos and said they have provided a full refund for the sofa and arranged for the sofa to be collected. However, Sara said after contacting Argos she was told that she had three options - keep the mismatched sofa, exchange for another more expensive model that they would need to foot the dference for or get a refund. This situation come just a couple of weeks after they ordered a £ range oven from Argos, only for it to arrive damaged and needing to be replaced. Sara said: Itaposs just ridiculous. We were told we had the wrong half because the grey was out of stock and they couldnapost provide the other half of the sofa we wanted. I would never buy from Argos again. We both have Argos credit cards but have decided to cancel them, theyaposre not having any more purchases from us. Itaposs so appalling itaposs laughable. It seems like one big joke, like someone is having a laugh. When Argos was contacted for comment they offered to speed up the refund for Sara and offered £ cash. An Argos spokesperson said: Weaposre in touch with Sara and Greg to apologise for their experiences, which do not meet our usual high standards. We have provided a full refund for the sofa as well as an additional gesture of goodwill. Weaposre also arranging for the mismatched sofa, which was delivered in error, to be collected.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Others criticised the behaviour as insane or silly with one insisting taking a kid isnapost smart.

Another recent World Meteorological Organizationrecord was set in , when a lightning bolt over Uruguay and northern Argentina lasted . seconds.  Lightning does not typically last for longer than a second, or stretch further than  miles, Randall Cerveny at Arizona State University, told the New Scientist. Rather than moving from sky to ground, as a regular strike would, the lightning moved from cloud to cloud. WMO spokesperson Clare Nullis said the trip by air would take a couple of hours. In this case, the distance was covered in a matter of seconds, she said.  We reiterate our message: when thunder roars, when you see lightning - go indoors. Donapost seek shelter in a beach hut, donapost stand under a tree, Nullis said. Both record-setting bolts were spotted in South America’s Great Planes of America and the Río de la Plata basin, areas known as thunderstorm hotspots.Thunderstorms occurring in these areas would often develop into huge weather events, bringing large lightning strikes, as they are prone to relatively big convective systems.The WMO confirmed the new records’ validity through the y process of tracking the strikes via a satellite tracking system. As both records happened in , it is thought the two weather events could show that weather events like thunderstorms, which kills hundreds of people a year, are becoming extreme. Despite this, it could also be down to improved technology that the record-setting strikes were observed so closely together.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

We’re playing for a famous trophy and it’s  years old. To have it first up adds to the buzz around the Six Nations. It will focus our minds next week.“The games in November were excellent in terms of seeing fans back when we arrived at the stadium, the noise they generated when we came on to the field and how they helped us through those games. So to have them there for our biggest fixture of the year will be a great boost to us.“We’ve also got three away games this year, so we’ll also have to handle those occasions where the crowd are against us and for the home team. But everyone involved in rugby can’t wait to play in front of supporters again for this Six Nations.”Team captain and former Hawick star Stuart Hogg added: “We know it’s going to be tough and physical, but these are the games you want to be involved in. I know I speak on behalf of everyone involved in the Scotland camp when I say we’re excited for next weekend.“It’s the best opportunity to kick off the Six Nations by playing England at home.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

Pugh’s monumental history of Dunbar is consulted, we read that there was a turnpike toll at Kirkhill near the town’s parish church another on the main road through Belhaven and a third known as Cleikimin Toll on the road from Dunbar to Spott.Kirkhill Toll stood near the parish church, near the former site of the Bellevue Hotel there is a house at the site today but this rather large two-story building does not look like a toll-house.Cleikimin Toll stood until Edwardian times but is today buried underneath the A road.Mr Pugh assures us that Belhaven Toll was known within living memory to bus drivers and conductors, but its situation has been open to debate.The Canmore database of Historic Environment Scotland contains the following reference to it: “Benston Cottage, in the angle between the Aand the south going cross road, is reported locally to have been a toll house, but it shows no features distinguishing as such apart, perhaps, from an outshot  foot square abutting its E end, with a small window facing the road. Visited  February .”Now who is right  The Belhaven locals or the Edinburgh architectural historian The earliest newspaper mention of Belhaven Toll is from July , when a certain James M’Dougal was on trial in Edinburgh for issuing counterfeit £ banknotes.The prisoner had asked several toll-keepers to issue change for his bogus banknotes, but when he came to Belhaven Toll and asked for a glass of whisky, the tollkeeper James Liddle did not at all like the look of the £ note he was handed.After the scoundrel M’Dougal had beaten a hasty retreat, Liddle gave the banknote to a Dunbar bank agent who pronounced it to be a forgery.M’Dougal was found guilty and sentenced to death issuing  banknotes was considered a heinous offence in those days.The property page of The Scotsman of March ,  contains the following important notice: “LAND AND HOUSES NEAR DUNBAR.It says: “The park adjoining the post-road on the west side of Belhaven Toll, consisting of  acres English measure or thereby, as presently possessed by Mr France, together with the dwelling-house, large garden, and offices thereon, called Rosebank.”It turns out that Rosebank House is still standing today, although a number of houses have been built in its extensive grounds, some of them along Edinburgh Road itself, including the former Belhaven police station.The next mention of Belhaven Toll is in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of October , , announcing the sale of “That PIECE of ENCLOSED GROUND, extending to   Acres imperial measure of thereby, situated to the South of Belhaven Toll-Bar, on the West Side of the road leading from Belhaven to Spott, and contiguous to the Line of the North British Railway Company”.These newspaper notices establish, without any doubt, that there was a toll-bar at Belhaven, constructed before  and still operational in  when the arrival of the railways meant that the old tollgates were under threat.William Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire tells us that the toll was there already by that time, at the junction of the post-road and a road going to the south-east.The newspapers provide some further valuable clues to its position.Back in , the grounds of Rosebank were on the south side of the post-road [today Edinburgh Road], just west of the junction with the road from Belhaven to Spott [today Beveridge Row].In , the farmland between Belhaven and the mainline railway was bordering what is today the west side of Beveridge Row and stated to be situated to the south of Belhaven Toll.This would indicate that the toll-house was situated at the corner of Edinburgh Road and Beveridge Row, and indeed this is the exact position of ‘Benston Cottage’ described in the Canmore survey by the doubting Edinburgh historian. I would not agree with the opinion of this inidual that the building looks unlike a toll-house.The Edinburgh toll-houses, of which specimens survive at Morningside and Merchiston, are single-storey buildings but have some quaint architectural features. The East Lothian toll-houses were even more primitive, even by the standards of the time: small and low cottages offering only the most basic amenities.Belhaven Toll – alias Benston Cottage – very much, in fact, resembles the Goatfield toll-house at what is today  Dunbar Road, Haddington, and the surviving toll-house in Haddington, Abbey and Aberlady.Thus it can be concluded that the locals were right, and that Belhaven Toll still stands today!On the morning of September , , the No.  bus between Dunbar and North Berwick took off without any incident.But on Edinburgh Road, Belhaven, it was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Antara and veered off the road, crashing right into. . . Benston Cottage alias Belhaven Toll!Fortunately, the cottage was empty as it was undergoing renovation further remedial work would surely be needed since the bus hit it with considerable force, knocking down the front door and some of the wall.A number of police and firefighters were soon at the scene, successfully cutting the trapped bus driver free using hydraulic gear and making sure that the other victims of the crash were taken away in ambulances. A -year-old East Linton RAF veteran, who had been a passenger on the bus, hit a handrail hard and later died in hospital.A -year-old man, the driver of the Antara, was charged with causing the incident, being handed by the courts an order of  hours of community service and banned from driving for three years.As for the battered former toll-house, it was repaired and taken care of by a firm of property developers, and is today used as a holiday let for out-of-town sportsmen and visitors, ‘sleeping six’ in the restored cottage and offering extra storage for surf boards and golf clubs.It is curious that neither the newspaper accounts of the bus crash, nor the Benston Cottage homepage ‘fishing’ for customers, mention the interesting past of the former toll-house.History can be made, but it can equally easily be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"snooker-legends-coming-musselburgh","story":"The two will recreate some of their most famous duels, accompanied by icon John Virgo as

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"new-highway-code-2022-test-new-rules-starting-today","story":"Major changes to the Highway Code requiring drivers to have more responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media -

This, of course, was exactly what was promised by Gordon Brown and David Cameron in . Instead, Westminster delivered Brexit, the UK Internal Market Bill, muscular unionism and the Government of Boris Johnston. I doubtMr Smith will find the answer to his fears in the Labour Party, which remains electorally irrelevant in Scotland.It is interesting that Mark Smith fails to mention the Scottish Conservatives as worthy opponents of the independence movement. Labelled as “lightweights” and “nobodies” by senior UK Government ministers, their beleaguered leader, Douglas Ross has now tasted the realpolitik of how Scotland is regarded by the UK Government. The Partygate fiasco has illustrated just how impotent all Scottish MPs are at Westminster, even when they belong to the party of government.However, I have good news for Mr Smith. The question of independence will soon be settled, perhaps much sooner than he thinks. Sustained pressure, both legal and democratic, will precipitate a second independence referendum. After all that has happened since , I am confident that the people of Scotland will choose to run their own affairs and Scotland will become an independent country. In common with all  nations which have gained independence from the UK, Scotland will not turn back but will rapidly establish its place in Europe, Nato and the UN as a thriving modern democracy. Mr Smith’s angst will be salved, the independence issue will be settled.Iain Gunn, Elgin.LABOUR MUST NOT PLAY THE SNP GAMEJUST who is advising Sir Keir Starmer on Scotlandhe thinks that the priority of any incoming Labour Government is more powers for Scotland Labour will only get elected again at a UK levelit looks and sounds like a Labour Party. It cannot out-compete the SNP on the constitutional question. If the Labour Party does not understand the value of being in a union, then what does it actually believe in  Surely it should understand what the arguments are.If it wants people to vote for it, then it should make itself visible and relevant to the electorate. Instead of trying to find an angle on the constitution, it should simply go out and find a whole lot of doctors, nurses, shop workers, lorry drivers and policemen to stand as candidates, people who really understand what is going on in the world at present. We will need  years to get properly out of the Covid situation. Concentrate on that, and Labour might stand a chance. Play the game that the SNP wants you to play and you can forget about it.Victor Clements, Aberfeldy.THE UKS MORAL BANKRUPTCYI AGREE with your correspondent Michael Sheridanwhen he describes the slogan \"Its Scotland Oil\" as depressing. To me the slogan represented the worst form of a narrow parochial nationalism, the opposite of what an outward-looking country should seek to be.However, Mr Sheridan and others who share his strongly unionist views have questions to answer, not least in outlining which institutions of the British state are worthy of respect. The question is all the more relevant, indeed pressing, considering that the British Prime Minister has shown utter disdain for these institutions, not least that of his own office. This contempt is glaringly obvious when we reflect on the Prime Ministers treatment of Parliament, the monarchy, the courts and very worryingly, devolution.Mr Sheridan goes on to say that our nation is a \"beacon of hope\" in the world Afghans, Iraqis and others may wish to disagree. He also says that when Scotland joined the Union the country was bankrupt. The worst form of bankruptcy is moral bankruptcy, something ubiquitous in the polity Mr Sheridan so admires.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.BALANCING UP DEMOCRACYI WAS astonished by the assertion from Jill Stephensonthat “the same amount of time andmoney” should be spent by those opposing Scottish self-government as by the elected Scottish Government. This implies that she is unaware of the Union Unit which was based in No , and fronted first by Luke Graham, then Oliver Lewis, or the Michael Gove-led Union Directorate. We also have the Union Strategy Committee, sitting above the Gove committee, all employing dozens of people across Whitehall, at substantial taxpayers expense: this without referencing the state propaganda outfit called the “Scottish Office”.All this has been going on for years, while the Scottish Government independence campaign has been in abeyance due to the pandemic. If Ms Stephenson takes off her blinkers, she must admit that the “time and money balancing” should be toward the pro-independence side: anything , as she asserts, is a “denial of justice and democracy”.GR Weir, Ochiltree.FRANCHISE IDEA IS DANGEROUSDOUGLAS McBeanadvocates extending the independence referendum franchise to all non-resident native Scots. That would be legitimatethe franchise were to be based on birth rather than residence but, for consistency, the quid pro quo would require removal of the franchise from any and all Scottish residents who were not Scottish by birth. Such a franchise test might go down well in Brexit-minded jurisdictions, but would surely be the wrong road to go down in an open-minded and welcoming European nation like our own.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.THE CASE FOR PR FOR WESTMINSTERCATRIONA C Clarkgives us a list of the places where the SNP has total dominance in the election of MPs. In doing so, she makes an excellent case for electoral reform at Westminster: it cannot be right that in  the SNP took  per cent of the seats on the basis of % – little over one-third – of the vote.Proportional representation would also have other wholly beneficial effects. It would stop the votes of non-nationalists being wasted and would indeed demonstrate that independence is only supported by a minority of Scottish voters. And at Westminster it would stop the SNP from taking its bogus position as the third party and its accompanying procedural and financial privileges. The only surprising thing is that the Tories and the Labour Party do not support electoral reform And before anyone asks, yes, I did support PR when first past the post disproportionately favoured the Labour Party.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ARMS SALES MAKE LITTLE SENSEGEORGE Fergusson’s Agenda articlehighlights the UK arms industry.A great many British people are puzzled by and despair when it seems clear that the sheer availability of guns in the United States makes repeated mass killings of innocent citizens inevitable. Yet Britain and France, unlike Germany and Japan, have no compunction about ensuring the ready availability of far more deadly weapons to the Middle East and where, making mass killings on a far greater scale than in the schools and streets of the US also inevitable.Mr Fergusson comments that \"there is little public opposition\" to our continuing arms sales. To find the free availability of weapons to American civilians unacceptable, but to be totally relaxed about our Governments determined supply of deadly armaments throughout the world, makes little sense.Ronald MacLean, Kiltarlity, by Beauly.DONT LET COVID GUARD DOWNBA., the sub-lineage of Omicron, is spreading, as Helen McArdle points out . It is more transmissible than Omicron BA. and has become the dominant iant in Denmark and India. BA.’s arrival in the UK on December  last year, with , cases now identied in England , is a wake-up call.We cannot afford to do away with face masks being worn in schools, on public transport and in indoor spaces. We also need to reinstate social distancing at one or two metres, as BA. is likely to prolong the virus at higher rates into February and March.Humankind will always be vulnerable to Covid iants unless we in the West ensure Covid vaccines are made available worldwide, especially in Africa, where only six per cent of Africans are vaccinated. Big Pharma has to be forced to waive intellectual property rights to Covid vaccines so that developing nations can produce Covid vaccines locally. In this way we can eventually get back to some real sort of normal.Sean Clerkin, Barrhead.Read more: Shame on those who want to abandon the Union for sordid gain"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scottish-government-needs-take-big-decisions-dysfunctional-calmac-ferry-operation","story":"The second point is that Calmac is not, of itself, “Scotland’s ferry network”, but one of no fewer than  year-round vehicle ferry providers operating in Scottish waters, which collectively carry signicantly more traffic than Calmac. Of these four are local authorities that underwrite any operational deficit. Four are commercial private operators that operate at a profit and are unfunded by the public purse, and in each case provide superior service to comparable state-funded services in terms of capacity, frequency and longer hours of operation. Oneis a commercial management company funded to operate ferries on behalf of the Scottish Government and then there is the state-owned David MacBrayne Group  Calmac, also funded to operate ferries on behalf of the Scottish Government.Bearing in mind the current multiplicity of ferry owning and operational practice in Scotland, there is no fundamental reason why the number of state-funded tenders should be restricted to two. It has often been stated that the large Calmac fleet enables vessels to be replaced easily in the event of breakdown or other disruption. In practice Calmac performs worse in this regard than almost all other Scottish operators, with frequent service disruption and capacity constraints being widely criticised by the communities affected.Of course de-bundling is anathema to the RMT “monopoly”, but the Scottish Government must decide whether the huge and ever-growing sums devoted to one dysal ferry operator is for the benefit and largesse of Calmac’s personnel or the well-being of the communities it purports to serve.Roy Pedersen, Inverness.PUNISHED FOR USING SCOTSHUGH Macdonald’s articlecertainly struck a chord with me regarding the Scottish “cringe” or feelings of inferiority, in particular when it relates to the way we speak. We are all aware of the days when Gaelic-speaking children were punished for using their own first language, but children were also punished for using Scots. Indeed even at home many of us were forbidden to speak anything other than the King’s English.My mother, born in , was brought up to have a lelong disdain for anything Scottish, considering most things as being inferior to English. After my paternal grandmother died, my grandfather came to live with us, and spoke with a broad Arbroath accent. This irritated my mother and she was upset when my speech started to adopt elements of his Angus tongue. So when I was about , she sent me to elocution lessons to “improve” the way I spoke. This was something I detested and something I had to keep from my schoolmates.However, her desire to make me sound “proper” backfired. My elocution teacher was impressed with the timbre of my recently-broken baritone voice and immediately set me to memorise and recite some poems – in Scots. I can still remember my mother’s look of horror when I started reciting “Willie Wastle dwalt on Tweed, the spot they ca’ed it Linkumdoddie. Willie was a wabster gude. Could stown a clue wi ony body”. It wasn’t the misogynistic content of Burns’ poem that bothered her – it was the Scots tongue.Unsurprisingly and to my great relief my lessons came to a rapid end, and to this day, almost  years later, I can still remember Willie Wastle well enough to recite it almost word perfect.Thanks, Rabbie.Neil Scott, Edinburgh.AN EGREGIOUS COMPLAINTI MUST object to the egregious overuse in yours and other areas of the media of the word “egregious”.We must put a stop to this egregious invasion of our language before it becomes too late.Even friends of mine who, until now, have spoken normally have taken to using this word, of which they were not aware until Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.Whilst I do not believe they are using this word egregiously, I believe the egregiousness can be laid at the door of the media whose egregious focusing on a word that sounds more learned than it is is truly egregious.By the way, the word originates from the Latin “egregius” meaning “outstanding”. So I remain, with all due humility, your egregious correspondent.William Thomson, Denny.THE TIRESOME FORWARD THINKINGR RUSSELL Smithdoes well to compose a letter containing so many of Britains endangered sayings.Of equal concern must be the plethora of new sayings now familiar to most of us.Business leaders, politicians and committee men and women never tire of telling us how their new policy will benefit us going forward.

More than halfadmit sustainability has had to take a step back due to Covid-, with the figure rising to two-thirdsof fashion and beauty retailers.The current supply chain crisis also comes to the fore as retailers continue to fight to keep shelves stocked and fulfil online orders. Some % of retailers also say there is a risk that sustainability will fall down their list of prioritiesthe crisis continues.Highlighting the need for sustainability to be embedded from the top down in an organisation, only two-fthsof retailers say the main person responsible for sustainability in their business has “signicant” or “high” influence on company decisions and projects.Sustainability, meanwhile, is also in a “battle of the priorities” with profits, with the vast majorityof retailers saying their shareholders look at profits before sustainability, and % believing that sustainability will never be of equal importance to profit.In addition, % of retailers admit their business sees sustainability more as a cost centre than a cost saver, despite sustainable initiatives – such as shared logistics – having the potential to improve efficiencies, reduce environmental impact and cut costs in the long-term.More positively, over halfof retailers say sustainability is important to their business, and % say it has moved up the agenda over the last year, while % say their approach to sustainability is becoming less organic and more strategic. Three-quartershave announced sustainability improvements, one-fthare giving customers a choice between standard and sustainable deliveries, and % have launched a new line of sustainable products separate from their standard offering.The increasingly high-profile area of rental and resale also comes to the fore, with % of fashion and beauty retailers and % of retailers in the lestyle and leisure sectors launching their own rental or resale service.Howard Beach, partner at TLT, comments: “Our research reveals just how vulnerable sustainability is to other priorities facing the retail sector at the moment. “These other pressures – like the supply chain crisis and staff shortages – are likely to continue for some time, so there’s an urgent need to find a way of balancing these demands. Retailers need to appoint people with the right expertise who can set the right strategy and oversee its implementation. They need to have credibility and a voice that is heard at the highest levels of the business.“At the same time, this isn’t something that can fall to just one person or team. It needs to be part of how the business operates, and people need clear communication and support in their roles. Simply put, sustainability cannot afford to lose this battle of the priorities to the extent that it has done for a quarter of retailers over the last year.”Meanwhile, just % of retailers – and % of grocers – are “very confident” they will meet the expectations of the Competition and Markets Authoritywhen it investigates misleading green claims this year.The finding comes as % of retailers say they are under pressure to make their position on sustainability more visible, and % are becoming more vocal about their sustainability credentials – despite % admitting it’s impossible for retailers to knowthey’re doing enough to say they’re sustainable.TLT’s Sustainability Matters – putting the “eco” in retail economics report identies three types of retailer:The report also highlights the fact that the biggest pressure to be more sustainable is coming from the Government and regulators , closely followed by customers , shareholders investorsand the media . Some % of retailers are becoming more vocal about their sustainability credentials, while just one-fthhave taken the bold move to position themselves as a “sustainable business”.Highlighting the growing legal risks associated with green claims, three-quartersof retailers say customers misunderstand claims about sustainability, while one-fthsuggest they do so “often”.TLT’s research also reveals that many retailers are signicantly more concerned about the PR risksof “greenwashing” than the legal risks, with only % worried about civil claims and % worried about regulatory prosecutions.According to retailers, the biggest barrier to preventing greenwashing is competing priorities , followed by the time it takes to do what’s neededand a lack of budget .One-quarterof retailers blame a lack of accepted benchmarks and definitions for terms such as “green”, “ethical” and “sustainable”, while one-fth blame a lack of in-house skillsand a lack of board-level support for sustainability .Mr Beach points out that the messaging from the CMA has been very clear. “The CMA has already announced that it is prioritising the fashion industry as part of its full-scale review this year,\" he notes.“The review should be a concern for all retailers who arenot only promoting their own businesses but also repeating or relying on the sustainability claims of their suppliers. Retailers who haven’t already done so need to familiarise themselves with the CMA’s Green Claims Code and its list of  questions. “They should review their internal procedures to identy where the risks might be and what changes might be needed.” www.tltsolicitors "},{"url":null,"title":"actor-podcaster-nicola-roy-shares-favourite-things-scotland","story":"BEST BEACHI think of Gullane in East Lothian straight away. A beautul sandy beach backed by high sand dunes close to the quaint village of Gullane. East Lothian is a lovely area. It’s a beach we would always go as children, a little escape from Edinburgh when needed. And sometimes you spot a famous golfer or two!BEST BUILDINGThe Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh is a beautul, old building with the castle as a backdrop. Inside, the grandeur of the chandelier, velvet seating and the classic proscenium arch stage always takes my breath away. This is where I was first mesmerised by the magic of theatre as a child. I joined their youth theatre and watched incredible talents such as Siobhan Redmond as Miss Jean Brodie. I have performed there many times and now I am proud to have my podcast The Cultural Coven, in association with it.BEST STREETTechnically it’s a th century close and not a street, but Lady Stairs Close is one of the secret little streets in Edinburgh’s Old Town. I love the juxtaposition of views one side on to the Royal Mile and the other on to the New Town. The unique, rickety buildings in the court are quintessentially old Edinburgh, it’s easy to feel the history of the city.BEST CHILDHOOD MEMORYDefinitely the girls’ trips to Nairn with my mum, grandma and sister in the holidays to visit my mum’s cousin Ian who owned the Braeval Hotel. The drive was always hilarious, my grandma map reading, getting it all wrong, while my mum would be playing Motown CDs. We’d have a pit-stop in Pitlochry, and venture into the old-fashioned sweetie shops. My mum would take us to explore castles and palaces. She died far too young but I’ve inherited her sense of adventure.BEST WALK OR CYCLEI live right by the Pentland Hills but when I was a child and we were on a drive, I would spot them from the motorway and immediately feel at home. I walk from the Bonaly side and you get the most incredible views over Edinburgh. You pass reservoirs, horses and even Highland cows just roaming free. You can walk for hours. I can see my old school from there and my grandma’s old house and right across to Fe. And they now even have a little café up there!BEST VIEWIt’s Sligachan Old Bridge up looking on to the Cuillins behind it and the apparently enchanted waters below it. I hadn’t been to Skye until the pandemic struck but I’ve since been three times and it has become a place of solace for me. I think this view is even more magical and mysterious when surrounded by the mist. It’s almost unfathomable that these huge mountains are on a small island.Legend has it that faeries live at Slighachan, I believe it but I’m not sure my boyfriend is convinced… yet.BEST SHOPThere are two shops that it’s impossible to choose between. Totty Rocks in Edinburgh is cool – they work with tartan and tweed in a modern way. Their designs are a clever, modern twist on nostalgic looks.Then Toys Galore in Edinburgh. An independent toy store that is an Edinburgh institution in Morningside. Toys you might think were now extinct are there. It felt special to visit as a child and even now to buy gts for children.BEST SCOTTISH DELICACYI’m not sure a drink is a delicacy butit was, it would be a peaty whisky. I ADORE it. A storytelling drink for the end of the night a cuddle in a glass.Food is all about context. I’m not a huge seafood fan but it’s hard to beat scallops at the Oyster Shed on Skye. I was there with my Canadian boyfriend a couple of weeks ago and those views on to the loch while standing round a barrel eating freshly cooked seafood feels special.BEST PLACE FOR A CUPPACaoro Dhubh Coffee Company in Carbost on Skye is this little hut that does the best coffee from the independent scene, right on Loch Harport in Carbost. It’s got a good focus on ethical trading too. It’s hard to think of a more unique location – one view is to the Talisker distillery and one is on to the water. When the sun shines and you sit at a wee table outside there is nothing better.BEST PLACE FOR ALONE TIMEFor me Braidburn Valley Park in Edinburgh is a peaceful, oasis. It’s  minutes’ walk from my house and where I go to learn linesI need a change of scene. I strongly associate it with being a little girl.My mum and dad would take us sledging there, and I would get lost in the Maisie the Morningside Cat books or the play The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. If I win the lottery you’ll find me lounging in a mansion in Morningside!Nicola is an actor and host of The Cultural Coven podcast.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions. The success of DRS in Scotland, however, will depend on ensuring we get the details right, not just in our cities but in rural and island settings as well.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With long-track it’s a time-trial. You could still do something silly and get disqualied, but the chances are really low.“I like thatyou skate well and you have a good execution of the race, that means you will put down a really good result.”Born in England to a British mother and a Dutch father, Smeding moved to Holland at a young age in order to learn the language, and found a natural progression from an initial love of roller-blading onto the ice in a nation that has won a remarkable  speed-skating gold medals. vw,vw,px, px\"Ellia Smeding will compete in Beijing alongside her partner Cornelius Kersten Alongside Kersten, who was born in Haarlem and also has a British mother, the duo funded their quest to reach Beijing by setting up a single-filter coffee business, Brew .She hopes interest in their performances could ultimately percolate down into improving the effectively non-existent domestic facilities for long-track, which requires a -metre ice oval.Perhaps a touch less ambitiously, Smeding senses the opportunity to swing the focus onto long-track at a Games where, for the first time since its addition to the Winter Olympic programme in , its short-track counterpart offers negligible medal opportunities for Britain.The relative serenity of the long-track oval will certainly offer a stark contrast to the short-track chaos in Pyeongchang, where pre-Games favourite Elise Christie fell three times in her elusive quest for a first Olympic medal.“Elise really made a name for herself and you’ve got to give lots of respect to her for that,” said Smeding, who is scheduled to make her first appearance at the Games in the women’s m on February .“But now we get the chance to show off the sister sport. Long-track is slightly dferent, slightly less prone to things going wrong, and this is a good opportunity to show off the sport.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s one word a day and it’s the same word for everybody and we’re all trying to figure it out together.“It’s just incredibly clever and I think it’s a game that we all needed because it just brings us together.”Wordle requires players to guess a five-letter word within six guesses, with grey, yellow and green coloured bricks used to indicateguessed letters are part of the answer and whether they match the right place in the correct word.Once solved, players are able to share their own results on social media via rows of the same coloured bricks but with the letters removed, so others can see how they did without having the puzzle ruined for them – a feature that has been attributed to the rapid rise in Wordle’s popularity, with many being introduced to it after seeing the yellow and green grids on s such as Twitter.Wordle   So nearly snatched grinding defeat from the jaws of immediate victory this morning.⬜🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩— Richard OsmanJanuary , “It has many layers to it, as simple as it is.

Every word that you guess you get feedback and now you have a new puzzle, a new challenge. It’s multiple puzzles built into one. It’s deceptively simple but there’s quite a bit going on.”Creator Mr Wardle, who lives in New York but was born in Wales, announced the sale on Twitter, thanking users for sharing touching stories about the effect the game has had on their lives and relationships and adding that he was “thrilled” about the takeover.He said: “Since launching Wordle, I have been in awe of the response of everyone that has played.“The game has gotten bigger than I ever imagined .An update on Wordle pic TmHdAIRLX— Josh WardleJanuary , “It has been incredible to watch the game bring so much joy to so many and I feel so grateful for the personal stories some of you have shared with me – from Wordle uniting distant family members, to provoking friendly rivalries, to supporting medical recoveries.“On the flip side, I’d be lyingI said this hasn’t been overwhelming.“After all, I am just one person, and it is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone.“Given this, I am incredibly pleased to announce that I’ve reached an agreement with The New York Times for them to take over running Wordle going forward.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

On that basis the proposal is legitimate.”SDLP councillor Steven Edwards said he felt the sum of £ was a fair amount to withhold.Backing the proposal, DUP Alderman Keith Kerrigan commented: “I know there was a recommendation from the committee which we weren’t in favour of.“I would like to request a recorded vote on this proposal. I feel with council still going against the legal advice which was brought forward, I feel we have a strong chance here that we will have legal action against this decision.”The proposal fell with  votes against,  for and  abstentions.The recommendation to withhold £ from the Castlederg Young Loyalists was subsequently ratied.Related topicsDerry City and Strabane District CouncilMore On Derry City and Strabane District CouncilPolice in Derry investigate ‘unnotied parade’ not connected to commemorationsNewry district tops league table for highest Covid infection rates in UKNI councils spending £k on pauper burials ‘a worrying trend of loneliness’ PremiumSale of leisure centre site to be re-run after legal challenge by losing bidder PremiumRevealed: Councillors voted against the advice of planners  times in last yearMost ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverColeraine woman thanks shoppers who ‘saved her le’ in TescoTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern Ireland‘Confidential personal information unlawfully obtained by Covid certication scheme’, court toldNatural gas supplier Firmus Energy to hike prices by %Taoiseach to meet cross-community group over opposition to legacy plansNI sports presenter Orla Chennaoui ‘devastated’ to miss out on Winter Olympics after Covid close contactPM’s Jimmy Savile jab at Starmer is ‘wrong and cannot be defended’, says former NI SecretaryLatestTripAdvisor reaches one billion contributions‘Magical’ puzzle Wordle is ‘lightning in a bottle’ – New York Times games bossPower due to be restored to ‘vast majority’ of homes affected by stormsFinancial Conduct Authority staff back industrial action over pay changesAmanda Holden shares tribute on stillborn son’s th birthday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While he had wanted to make the climb last year, the pandemic scuppered those plans.But he took off from Heathrow on New Year’s Day for Buenos Aires. This was followed by a connecting flight to Mendoza, and a four-and-a-half-hour bus journey to Aconcagua.Eight hours of climbing for just over two weeks meant he was burning close to , calories daily.

He gave me a big handshake and a hug, and we also took a selfie before he went off running down the mountain like a mountain goat.“I was just in awe of this moment I had, and almost felt like God had sent him to me in this moment to encourage me.“I just had so much strength and I was able to just go up to the mountain with no issues at all.”On ing home a positive Covid test indicated Nathan contracted the virus during the trek.Some of the struggles he faced during the final days of the climb were probably linked to his symptoms.He added: “It’s nice to be home — evenI’m only able to see the dog again.”Most ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsColeraine woman thanks shoppers who ‘saved her le’ in TescoTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern IrelandCouncil withholds £ Good Relations funding from Castlederg loyalist band‘Confidential personal information unlawfully obtained by Covid certication scheme’, court toldNatural gas supplier Firmus Energy to hike prices by %Taoiseach to meet cross-community group over opposition to legacy plansNI sports presenter Orla Chennaoui ‘devastated’ to miss out on Winter Olympics after Covid close contactLatestGenetic marker carried by descendants of Robert the Bruce is identiedLeaving Certicate will be exams only this yearPublic may not be toldJohnson fined for partygate Covid rule breachesSunak ‘too distracted by plotting for PM’s job’ to deal with cost of livingJohnson rebuked by Speaker over Savile jibe at Labour leader,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The CEO’s salary is set by the remuneration and performance committee which is made up of three members of the board, known as the Council. All of our board members are volunteers.”Unicef Ireland’s director, Peter Power, has an annual salary of €, , while St Vincent de Paul’s national director , Andy Heffernan, brings home between €, and €, Agnes Lunny is the chief executive of learning disability charity Positive Futures, based in Northern Ireland, and Positive Futures Ireland, based in the Republic.Her combined salary for both roles is £, annually.In her response to this newspaper request, Ms Lunny said: “My average working week across both roles is + hours, more often than not  hours. That puts my hourly pay at between £ and £.“My salary was recently increased following a benchmarking exercise against similar roles in Health  Social Care.”All-Ireland wellbeing charity Inspire’s chief executive, Kerry Anthony, has an annual salary of between £, and £,. An Inspire spokesperson said: “You will see from our accounts that our income mostly comes from contracts for services with very little coming from donations from the public. Any donations we do get from the public to support our work go straight to the projects for which they are raised and don’t contribute to the pay of our CEO.”Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen, a member of Stormont’s Communities Committee, said he can understand why some may be concerned by charity bosses taking in large salaries, however the signicant amount of work they undertake must be taken into account.“The structure and complexity of modern charities require leadership and ability at the highest levels to ensure the organisation is managed effectively to deliver vital support services for their beneficiaries,” he said.“While I understand fully the public concern that salaries of some charity chief executives are over £,, it is important to recognise the experience and skills required to run an organisation that employs hundreds of people, manages millions of pounds of public money and donations — delivering vital services to our most needy and vulnerable.If an inidual could earn more in a similar position in the private sector, as is the case in many of these examples, then how can our charities attract the best and most qualied leaders to ensure services to those most in need are deliveredthey are not offering a comparable salary that recognises the skills and experience needed ”In December , it emerged that the then-Communities Minister Caral Ni Chuilin had commissioned an independent review of the Charity Commission, following a report by senior civil servant Jonathan Baume looking at how the Department for Communities handled complaints in relation to the Commission.Responding to an Assembly question about the Baume report’s recommendations by TUV leader Jim Allister at the time, Ms Ni Chuilin said: “The former Head of the Civil Servicecommissioned a review into how the Department for Communities had handled a number of complaints from a member of the public in relation to the Charity Commission.“HOCS asked my Department to respond to the suggestions set out in the review. These are currently being progressed, including consideration of the Department’s role as the custodian of charity regulation law and policy and sponsor for the Commission.“The Department’s Head of Governance has also written to the Chief Commissioner to seek assurances in relation to matters highlighted in the Review.“In order to restore public confidence in a system that has undoubtedly been damaged, I have also decided to commission an independent review of charity regulation including a review of the performance of the Charity Commission in its role as statutory regulator.”Related topicsAndy AllenJim AllisterDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Andy Allen PremiumViewpointOpinionCharities must look at sky-high salaries PremiumShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last year PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in funding PremiumQuestions raised after Justice Department s £m to Finance Department as PSNI faces budget shortfall PremiumHousing Executive owns more than  acres of unused land while, people on homes waiting listMost ReadCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsColeraine woman thanks shoppers who ‘saved her le’ in TescoLatest Northern IrelandCouncil withholds £ Good Relations funding from Castlederg loyalist band‘Confidential personal information unlawfully obtained by Covid certication scheme’, court toldNatural gas supplier Firmus Energy to hike prices by %Taoiseach to meet cross-community group over opposition to legacy plansNI sports presenter Orla Chennaoui ‘devastated’ to miss out on Winter Olympics after Covid close contactLatestGenetic marker carried by descendants of Robert the Bruce is identiedLeaving Certicate will be exams only this yearPublic may not be toldJohnson fined for partygate Covid rule breachesSunak ‘too distracted by plotting for PM’s job’ to deal with cost of livingJohnson rebuked by Speaker over Savile jibe at Labour leader,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As the supplier had technically met the contract’s specication and had already incurred costs, % of the contract value was unable to be recovered.”During the year, the DHSC wrote off laboratory equipment valued at £, following the closure of two regional testing sites and “there being no alternative options for repurposing or storing these assets”.Additionally, a stockpile of intensive care unit items was created to prevent shortages.The reports said: “A small number of items, valued at £,, reached their expiry date and had to be written off.”When it comes to NHS Test and Trace, DHSC has “impaired… consumables totalling £ million in respect of items for which we have not currently identied a suitable use.”Two flights relating to the transportation of PPE from China had to be cancelled due to lack of stock availability at the time, and the £, deposit for the two flights was taken as a cancellation charge, “as per the terms of the contract”.The report also pointed to “changing requirements” which meant the DHSC incurred a cancellation fee of £, following the cancellation of two contracts for quarantine hotels.Interest payments were paid to a supplier totalling £. million resulting from the late payment of invoices as a result of an initial contractual dispute, which ended up in the DHSC being forced to pay.In the first six months of the Covid- pandemic in the UK use of PPE in England alone added an additional % carbon burden, compared with pre-Covid-. Between February and August , three billion items of PPE were used, resulting in  tonnes of waste per day. Much of this PPE use was unnecessaryWHO study of PPE wasteThe Government’s auditor, the comptroller and auditor general to the House of Commons, said in his section regarding the accounts that the DHSC was put under “extraordinary pressure” by the pandemic and had to operate outside normal processes and procedures.But he said it “was not able to manage adequately some of the elevated risks, resulting in signicant losses for the taxpayer. Nearly two years later, it has not fully restored effective control over some of the inventory purchased”.“The chief secretary to the Treasury wrote to the department on  December  confirming HM Treasury’s view that £. billion of the department’s spending did not have proper HM Treasury consent and was irregular. He stated that ‘in the vast majority of cases’ this was because either the department or NHS England had spent funds without approval or in express breach of the conditions that had been set.”It comes as a World Health Organisationstudy on PPE waste pointed to “unnecessary” use in the UK.It said: “In the first six months of the Covid- pandemic in the UK use of PPE in England alone added an additional % carbon burden, compared with pre-Covid-.“Between February and August , three billion items of PPE were used, resulting in  tonnes of waste per day. The greatest contribution came from gloves. Much of this PPE use was unnecessary.”Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said the Government was “inept”, adding: “They cannot be trusted with our money and are totally out of touch.”Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: “These levels of waste destroy any claim the Conservatives have to be careful stewards of the public finances.“Along with the Government’s laissez faire attitude to fraud, this will be particularly galling to hard-working households wondering how they will pay the higher taxes the Chancellor is imposing this April.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle.

The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9720633.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I took up art, I did it for about a year and that was the end of that.“Then about five years ago, my sister’s husband had died and we were clearing out the house. I found that she’d kept all of the sketches I’d done when I was  in an envelope. “I started looked at them, messing around with them, I bought some paints and started colouring them in.Clubsound in the s. PACEMAKER PRESS BELFAST“The nights I wasn’t working I was painting. In two years I must have done about  paintings for people.“It’s a blessing for me, it kept me sane, when you play every week and suddenly you stop, it hits you hard.“It relieved the boredom, it gave me something to focus on, when a painting turned out successful you felt you’d achieved something.“My biggest satisfaction is that I’ve painted memories for people that are now hanging in their house.George Jones started and finished his radio career with Downtown. Picture by CHARLES MCQUILLAN PACEMAKER.“It’s another sense of entertainment I suppose, another string to my bow. If my sister hadn’t kept those sketches I wouldn’t have all of this.”George recalled his sister’s influence on his musical career: “The first two records my sister brought in that started me on music when I was about nine or  were Little Richard ‘Long Tall Sally’ and Elvis ‘All Shook Up’. “In those days it wasn’t vinyl, it was  bakelite – it looked the same as vinyl butyou’d dropped it, it would have smashed. “I listened to them non-stop and then she bought me my first guitar at .”George said he formed skfle groups with boys of his age in the Bloomfield area of east Belfast. One of them was Van Morrison, whom George went on to tour with as The Monarchs.He said: “I go to lunch with Van Morrison quite a lot. The Monarchs were the first band to go to Germany. We had a hit record in  when the Beatles were still hovering around Germany.“Van has been trying to find the rights to it to repress it and put it out as a single on vinyl. I sung on it and he played saxophone – a bit of rock and roll.”George, who has been part of the successful ‘Do You Come Here Often ’ and ‘Rock ‘n Roll Years and Dance Hall Days’ shows, started learning the guitar at . He believes that might be the magic number: “I’ve interviewed so many people in my years on the radio who started the exact same way. “I’m hesitant to ask when they started to play the guitar – it’s always . So many great guitarists I interviewed, the likes of Hank B Marvin, started at .”Having found his first chords at  George is still going strong at .He said: “For me it’s been an incredible le, just when you think it’s all over, Clubsound have found a new lease of le.“We’ve found out that young people have started listening to the albums their parents have. I hesitate to use the term, but you become a cult.“Young ones come up to me and say ‘Yeoooo, Shankill Airways, my mum plays that all the time’.”George said the state modern music meant that people are yearning for songs from bygone days, especially the fties and sixties: “It was real music, there was no electronics – it was guitars, live drums, you were getting the whole live vibe.“In our day you just piled in, there was no such thing as tickets, you paid at the door and they squeezed in as many as they could.That added to the experience.”George plans to publish his memoirs as a book. In it he plans to recount his first meetings with Rory Gallagher and an incredibly green Gary Moore, of whom he told his father, ‘that wee lad will never be a guitar player’.‘It took a long time but I’m now over shock exit from Radio Ulster’George said that when he made his radio debut with Downtown his plan wasn’t to dilute his Clubsound persona too much.He said: “I used to bring what I did on stage onto the radio. I used to bring these we characters like Sadie that I did the voices for – she got more mail that I did. Radio needs to entertain,you’re on for two hours you’re not just sitting there spinning dics, you have to draw people in.”It wasn’t long before George was snapped up by Radio Ulster where he delivered ‘Just Jones’ for an amazing  years. Then one fateful day he was told he was surplus to requirements despite his popularity.George said: “People come up to me to this day, saying, ‘we miss you on the raido’ and ‘why did they do that to you’. “It was a big change in my le, it brought me down to earth more than anything. I thought those days were over – about two more times before that we were down and out and started over again, especially after the Miami thing and in South Africa my son nearly died of typhoid.“There were downs, but this was one I didn’t expect. I felt I was doing a good job.“During my six month notice period the public lted me to heights I never would believe. On the last week I was there I got nearly , emails from all over the world. I walked out of there about  feet tall. That was the bonus.”He said: “My we and family have helped me put it behind me. It took a long time because I was hurting.“I took up U with good success. It was water under the bridge and I had to put it under the bridge. I finished up in Downtown where I’d started in the s. Then I said to myself, radio is changing but it’s time for me to step aside.“When I look back now at radio in general, it’s like looking back to the wonder years of music, it saddens me – why has it changed so much  The commercial radio stations are just advertising boards with bits of music. “The word entertainment has disappeared from broadcasting. You couldn’t sit and listen to a radio show for two hours now, whereas before you’d have people would have been glad of that two hours of company.”Asked who he listens to on the ‘wireless’ George said: “Ken Bruce is still one of the old school and he makes me laugh. He still plays the oldies. Steve Wright still plays oldies. Asides from that it’s Classic FM.“It breaks my heart but I wouldn’t listen to any local radio stations.”Where to see George and Clubsound in actionClubsound’s current line-up of George Jones, David McKnight, Barry Woods, Alan McCartney and Jimmy Black will be on the road this spring including gigs at Theatre at The Mill in Newtownabbey on Saturday, March , Armagh’s Market Place Theatre on Saturday, April  and the Portico Arts and Heritage Centre in Portaferry on Monday, April . There will also be a gig at the Millennium Forum in Londonderry on Thursday, November . The same venue hosts ‘Rock ‘n Roll Years and Dance Hall Days’ on Saturday, February .——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s one word a day and it’s the same word for everybody and we’re all trying to figure it out together.“It’s just incredibly clever and I think it’s a game that we all needed because it just brings us together.”Wordle requires players to guess a five-letter word within six guesses, with grey, yellow and green coloured bricks used to indicateguessed letters are part of the answer and whether they match the right place in the correct word.Once solved, players are able to share their own results on social media via rows of the same coloured bricks but with the letters removed, so others can see how they did without having the puzzle ruined for them – a feature that has been attributed to the rapid rise in Wordle’s popularity, with many being introduced to it after seeing the yellow and green grids on s such as Twitter.Wordle   So nearly snatched grinding defeat from the jaws of immediate victory this morning.⬜🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩— Richard OsmanJanuary , “It has many layers to it, as simple as it is.

Every word that you guess you get feedback and now you have a new puzzle, a new challenge. It’s multiple puzzles built into one. It’s deceptively simple but there’s quite a bit going on.”Creator Mr Wardle, who lives in New York but was born in Wales, announced the sale on Twitter, thanking users for sharing touching stories about the effect the game has had on their lives and relationships and adding that he was “thrilled” about the takeover.He said: “Since launching Wordle, I have been in awe of the response of everyone that has played.“The game has gotten bigger than I ever imagined .An update on Wordle pic TmHdAIRLX— Josh WardleJanuary , “It has been incredible to watch the game bring so much joy to so many and I feel so grateful for the personal stories some of you have shared with me – from Wordle uniting distant family members, to provoking friendly rivalries, to supporting medical recoveries.“On the flip side, I’d be lyingI said this hasn’t been overwhelming.“After all, I am just one person, and it is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone.“Given this, I am incredibly pleased to announce that I’ve reached an agreement with The New York Times for them to take over running Wordle going forward.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uMagical u puzzle Wordle is  ulightning in a bottle u  u New York Times games boss article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We need families and students to continue to take part in the programme.”Last week, vulnerable five to -year-olds become eligible for their first Covid- jab.Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders , said: “The initial rollout of Covid vaccinations to  to -year-olds in our schools and colleges appears to have been reasonably successful, according to these figures from the Office for National Statistics.“But it is important to note that this is a snapshot of the vaccination effort as it stood at the end of the first full school week of January and before second jabs were offered to  to -year-olds,” she added.“The signicant regional iations in the number of students vaccinated are concerning and it is dficult to overlook that the areas with the lowest uptake – London and the North West – were hotspots for very high levels of student and staff absence at the end of the autumn term, a pattern that has largely continued during the first few weeks of the new year.“Even more worrying is the low uptake of vaccinations among pupils eligible for free school meals and in the most disadvantaged areas of England, as well as among students who speak English as an additional language and those with special educational needs .“These are the students who can least afford more time out of school.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas metercosts will increase by around pound per year to pound,. The Ten TownsareaincludesAntrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon ,Limavady,Derry-Londonderry, Newry and more than other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “The Utility Regulator forewarned us that energy price rises of this nature will continue because of exceptionally high global wholesale gas prices, however it is never good news for consumers when prices go up. This is going to put extreme pressure on many households as they try to pay their gas bills. “With the cost of energy continuing to increase, the Consumer Council is concerned about a potential rise in fuel poverty as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “We welcome firmus energy’s commitment to assist some of our most vulnerable consumers through support for the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme, but it is clear that energy companies including firmus, policy makers, The Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high fuel prices will be with us for years.” Consumers who are struggling with their energy bills or topping up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support. Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free, independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailingcontact@consumercouncil.org.uk. The Consumer Council’s websitehas a number of free resources includingSwitch On: A Guide for Home Energy Users,which helps consumers be more energy efficient at home, get the best from their electricity or gas supply, and save money. firmus energy customers in Greater Belfast and in the gas to the West network area will not be impacted by this tarf change.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_befebdaebbaefc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeeefadbcedbff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
