JFK was campaigning to be elected to a second term as Massachusetts’s senator and, if successful, there were strong rumours that he would make a run for the presidency in 1960. After several days taking pictures of husband and wife, Clark asked over lunch at the house if he could get a picture of the senator with his baby daughter, Caroline. “Jackie said no,” he recalled, “that she was upstairs asleep. But Jack bounded up the stairs, and I followed.”Clark took a spontaneous roll of film up in the nursery. It included this picture capturing the moment Caroline woke up, wide-eyed with delight to see her father. The nation was starting to share that excitement. Clark’s cover story for Life did much to advance the growing conviction that Kennedy was a leader for a new generation and a new decade. Up until that moment, presidents were far more likely to be grandparents than new dads, and family photographs were largely awkwardly staged compositions.Clark, who was based in Tennessee, had made his name in the aftermath of war, photographing the Nuremberg trials, and the bombed-out ruins of Germany and France. In 1962, aged only 51 and at the height of his powers, he was forced to give up his career at Life because of failing eyesight. A new surgical procedure partly restored his vision in 1980 and he returned to photography for the remaining 20 years of his life. The picture of Caroline Kennedy in her crib is included in a new book taken from the photographer’s personal archive. When he became president, JFK hung Clark’s picture in pride of place in the Oval Office Jackie purchased 75 prints.

Initially just two trains a day will operate, with services likely to be increased next year.Tickets will go on sale from 1 September, priced at £40 each way. They can be booked up to February 2021, allowing passengers to plan a Christmas or new year break in the Dutch capital.The introduction of the service comes amid uncertainty because of ongoing travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The UK government has removed the Netherlands from its list of countries people can travel to without having to quarantine on their return.Travellers who arrive back in the UK from the Netherlands after 15 August have to self-isolate for 14 days under coronavirus safety measures. Eurostar says it will offer more flexible booking options, including accepting changes to any booking at no cost up to 14 days before departure.The operator has also suspended its popular seasonal south France route – to Avignon and Marseille – until 2022, in order to focus on routes between London, Paris and Brussels which have the highest demand and shorter journey times. It operates up to five daily return trains between London and Paris and up to two to Brussels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fceeaefdb3576d9c9fe6f9340c3aef425a46b898/1_0_3541_2124/master/3541.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=610040f4d600cb0c9c1aebfcb7a89b84","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

Clued-up undergrads TikTokking their uni experience are real-time proof, though, that healthy student eating is not a myth. You just need your feet on the ground and some tricks up your sleeve.While she was all over the place upon arrival at Essex University, it didn’t take long for Emily Solman to find solace in cooking. “It became my little getaway, especially when living with other people, having my own time to watch a YouTube video and chop up some veg. I’d be like: ‘Mum, look what I’ve done!’”For #onepoundmeals cookbook author Miguel Barclay, the single most important tip is to learn to cook from scratch. Your food will be tastier, healthier and cheaper. His Instagram, @miguelbarclay, is a good place to start: all familiar ingredients and recipes no longer than a tweet. Fancy a curry? “Fry up some onions,” he says. “Then chuck in finely diced potato, some curry powder and a can of chopped tomatoes (two solid store cupboard staples right there). Add in any other veg and a protein if you like, cook and serve with rice.”Of course, learning to cook involves learning to shop. Ehis Ilozobhie (@ehis) loves his seafood, and when he first arrived at King’s College London was a dab hand at prepping it. But he’d never had to pay for it. “I was like, ‘Mom, are these prices right?’” He soon got organised. He’d go through his fridge on a Sunday to make a list, then head to the supermarket for that, and only that.When shopping, there are three things to remember: own-brand items are just as good as branded ones fresh produce is often discounted at the same time every day, so clock when that is and the frozen section is your friend (berries, peas, chopped broccoli, you name it, it’s a bargain).Solman’s diet is mostly plant-based, but with added fish. Ilozobhie began his second year cutting out meat too. For anyone wishing to go full vegan, chef and musician Denai Moore (@deestable) says it’s easy: “You can veganise pretty much anything!” She still makes mac ‘n’ cheese (albeit with nutritional yeast), and a scramble on toast for breakfast – only it’s tofu, not eggs.On her vegan website, Pick Up Limes, Sadia Badiei has a super-helpful visual prompt for ensuring your nutritional intake. She calls it the plate method. At every meal, make sure your plate is: half fruit and veg, one-quarter carbs (potato, bread, rice, oats ...) and one-quarter protein (pulses, tofu, nuts, meat, fish ...), with some added fat (avocado, olive oil ...) and, twice a day, a serving of dairy (or plant-based equivalent – for the calcium).Badiei only started paying attention to what she ate a year into her dietetics degree. In other words, you’ve got time to get it right. Try to keep healthy and get into a good routine of sleep, take regular exercise and eat balanced meals. These habits will safeguard your mental and physical wellbeing for life.But don’t beat yourself up when you can’t. If you need the coffee, drink the coffee (add soy milk to boost nutrients). Likewise, allow yourself to snack – but try to stick to healthier options such as malt loaf and oat bars. And remember it’s the basics that are most important: always have something in your fridge. Fun fact: “Constipation,” says Badiei, “is a huge thing for students globally!” Stay hydrated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cc2f6458e03aa57313e953cab39eb1b9f898b84/0_119_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5205cef96d3d9ae5e69dcbfb3280ce26","title":"greta thunberg returns to school after year off","story":"Swedish environmental activist says she’s heading back to the classroom after travelling the world, spreading her conservation message Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg said has returned to school after a year off campaigning to curb climate change.“My gap year from school is over, and it feels so great to finally be back in school again!” the 17-year-old tweeted, attaching a smiling photo of herself with a schoolbag on her back and her hands resting on a bicycle.Thunberg did not say in which city or school she would be continuing her studies.Since her last school year finished in June 2019, the teenager’s travels around the world meant that she ended up doing lessons remotely.Rather than head into the final years of secondary school, she travelled across the Atlantic by sailing boat – hoping to highlight the carbon emissions of flying.Her ultimate destination had been the COP25 UN climate conference in Chilean capital Santiago.But the event was ultimately shifted to Madrid because of massive unrest in Chile, leaving Thunberg to sail back from the US to Europe on board a catamaran belonging to a young Australian couple.While in North America, Thunberg rebuked world leaders at the UN, had a repeat visit with former US President Barack Obama, was given the keys to the city of Montreal and travelled around the continent in a Tesla electric car lent by former California governor and action star Arnold Schwarzenegger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78863e361540934d8746aae9ccb1459888faaa60/0_192_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=dbab0de05527daa6e05fdbc9a6e4df66","title":"mathieu flamini former arsenal midfielder sustainability athletes positive impact","story":"Former Arsenal midfielder has made sustainability his life goal and wants more athletes to follow the example set by Marcus RashfordMathieu Flamini wants to be certain we are getting down to business. “I’m quite hyperactive as you know,” he says. “If we’re beginning the interview I need to start walking around. Sitting down is something I’m not good at doing for a long time.”Moments later he is off and running. At times over the next hour it feels hard to keep pace, the ideas pinging around in a manner familiar to anyone who can picture him eating up the yards during the peak of his football career. Flamini is on a mission. He wants athletes to seize their opportunity, in fractured and rudderless times, to disrupt the status quo and use their voices meaningfully. He would like them to channel their life experience and, when the subject matter is relevant, become activists. Essentially, he would like more of them to follow in the footsteps of Marcus Rashford.“I sent him a message telling him: ‘You’ve made us all very proud, you’ve been an inspiration,’” he says of his reaction to the government U-turn prompted by Rashford’s articulate, persistent and flawlessly reasoned argument that free school meal vouchers should be continued over the summer. “We all have to stand together so more and more athletes can understand they have a social responsibility, and can use their platform to drive positive change. We don’t accept being told to shut up any more.”Flamini is not merely sounding off. While Rashford can speak compellingly about the sacrifices his mother made during his childhood in Wythenshawe, the former Arsenal midfielder found much of his own world view shaped when growing up in southern France. His involvement as co-founder of GF Biochemicals, a dazzlingly successful entity that focuses on finding sustainable alternatives to oil-based products, is well known and bears no resemblance to tropes around footballers discovering sidelines in, say, real estate.“Growing up by the sea, I could see from a very early age the impact of plastics in the water, on the beach,” he says. “It’s horrendous and makes you realise that, if we don’t change something, the place where we live won’t be liveable any more. I was very aware of everything, very curious. I always told myself: ‘If I do something else later on outside football, I want it to be around sustainability.’“The opportunity came along, we started, and I was not very knowledgeable around everything when I began. But through the years I’ve become part of this world of passionate people who give their lives to put the planet, the environment, the sea, before even themselves. It’s very inspiring but what they are missing is a voice, a platform. So as a footballer I’ve always tried, after developing my knowledge, to create awareness and make a small impact myself.”What he calls his “journey around sustainability” began with GF Biochemicals’ birth in 2008, when he was 24. It happened during a year in which he enjoyed the best season of his life at Arsenal and earned a move to Milan. Even for a man who just kept on going – the sight of Flamini fuelling himself with colossal bowls of pasta at the London Colney training ground was a common one – there should not be enough hours in the day. But he says such weighty external interests affected his football positively, constituting “an escape, clearing my mind, refreshing myself to come back stronger”.During his second spell in north London teammates would look on in a mixture of amusement and genuine interest when, after training, he would change into a suit and drive off to a meeting. Héctor Bellerín, a kindred spirit, reminded him of that recently. “He told me: ‘I was thinking, wow, one day I also want to do something like that.’ We need more players like Héctor that are thinking outside the box, using their platform to create a positive impact. We speak too much about negative things. Let’s speak about beautiful things let’s speak about love, let’s unite people.”By now he must have completed several laps of the building – in France, though he is based in London – in which he is taking the call. The thoughts keep coming, though: Flamini is particularly interested in how elite footballers, blessed with access to some of the best doctors and nutritionists, can exert a direct influence in public health. At length, he expounds the benefits of cutting animal protein and dairy, while increasing one’s water intake, and how such decisions need not only benefit athletes. There is, he believes, an obvious place to begin informing wider society.“I was reading about the UK standing up to obesity, the NHS being under a lot of pressure and the government doing a campaign around it. Great, finally we are talking about it – so why don’t we involve athletes, footballers, in pushing these messages to educate younger generations? Football has a role to play here. Let’s bring players into schools to speak about how important it is to eat healthily, and let’s use social media. If we want to reach a large number of kids, that’s how we need to do it.”Flamini worries young people are “living in a system that is killing the dreams of their generation” and, more than once, points to a lack of trust in established institutions. The space between them is the one he thinks sportspeople, with their huge social media followings, can inhabit and use to bring back that faith in public figures.Although now a businessman enjoying considerable success, he still wants to be viewed as a footballer. The sport is, he stresses, the first thing he thinks about upon waking up. As recently as last year he was playing in La Liga for Getafe all that conditioning acumen has helped ensure that, at 36, he still feels more than physically capable. “Everything is possible,” is all he will offer on the topic of a comeback in the meantime he stays in constant touch with developments at Arsenal, expressing particular satisfaction at the managerial promise of his former teammate Mikel Arteta.“It was always clear he’d go in the direction of coaching,” he says. “Even back then, he’d mention it. I’m very happy the club has trusted an ex-player because for too many years that was missing at Arsenal: someone who feels, breathes and lives the club. I really hope he’ll be successful and that we’ll be one of the main contenders very soon.”Now he is taking a seat once more and the camera, switched off while he darted about, is back on. We are finishing up but it is clear that, for Flamini, this will only be a momentary pause. “These days people really value authenticity, honesty and transparency,” he says. “We have a great opportunity to help so many people in our communities. For me, a champion is someone who not only wins on the pitch, but takes the lead off it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19ed0583483c6c03a5939f88a6d2ad4d622ec0fc/0_81_847_508/master/847.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=20f269bee1f7719c8e91e0847fa14bc0","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

But can their spirit ever be recreated on a screen?Back in February, the streets of Trinidad and Tobago’s Port of Spain were full of carnival revellers, as is the custom for what is billed as the greatest show on earth. Photos from those days now look as if they were beamed from another world. “It seems like 10 years ago!” exclaims Solange Govia, designer of costumes for Tribe, Bliss and Harts, three of the largest carnival bands in Trinidad. “So much has happened, and is happening.”The summer carnival season worldwide, from Antigua and Barbuda to Notting Hill in London, has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those who live for carnival, or for whom carnival is their livelihood, are trying to figure out how to cure a kind of tabanca – a Trinidadian word for longing sadness – like no other.This isn’t just a cancelled party: carnival’s history is rich and deep, a creole celebration of culture and freedom from colonial enslavement and oppression. It’s about taking up space, as Dr Jo-Anne Tull, coordinator of Carnival Studies at the University of the West Indies, underlines: “The contemporary Caribbean has come to own this space. Carnival allows the average person to claim the road.”But despite the deserted roads, “no matter what, art finds a way,” says Kees Dieffenthaller, lead singer of soca group Kes the Band. With the regular schedule of jumping from one carnival to the next scrapped, he and his band have turned to recording what they call a “live” album. As his bandmate and brother Jon Dieffenthaller describes, “It proved to be a time to really clear your mind and approach creativity in a more refreshing way.” Their album was not recorded in front of an audience, but still attempts to capture the live energy of a soca-soundtracked carnival.Kees says the band have always aimed for “timeless” tunes that transcend carnival season, including 2020’s road march-winning Stage Gone Bad, with Iwer George. Road march winners are crowned based on how many times a song is played as carnival bands cross through judging points at Trinidad and Tobago carnival – Stage Gone Bad clocked up 386 spins. The song, referencing the exhilaration of being one of a band of masqueraders “on stage” at a particular judging point – showcasing costumes and soaking up the experience – speaks of a space and time that now feels so distant. “The world has changed and we don’t know what it will change into,” Kees says.Notting Hill Carnival’s solution is to move online for this weekend’s celebrations, and tens of soundsystems and costumed “mas” bands have been filmed for it, including the Elimu Paddington Arts Mas Band. Founder and artistic director Ansel Wong describes the filming as “transcribing”, taking “the kinetics of performance and movement of people online, to get as close an approximation as possible to the experience of the road”.Being online means a focus on iniduals instead of a collective presentation: you can’t recreate a crowd of thousands. Wong speaks of the difficulty of recreating the “density of movement” in this distanced setting, while Govia explains that mas costumes are not made with a video camera in mind: “You are designing to see it in a group. I’m always thinking about how it is going to look on the road and how girls are going to look next to each other in their feather backpacks – how they are going to manoeuvre through the crowd”.The art of mas, for Wong, is the “art of presenting a theatrical presentation of the road”, moving through the architecture, transforming the space, forever adapting and changing depending on the crowd and the road itself. The shift in engagement, with a camera as opposed to an audience on the street, means these performances will lack spontaneity.He also notes how carnival challenges the control of regulatory bodies and the police. In the UK, concrete blocks and steel fencing have been introduced on the Notting Hill Carnival route in recent years: “Where the road has been the site of liberatory struggles, it becomes like a prison and encases you. It gets worse each year.” Tull calls for a balance between safety, maintaining “a people’s socio-cultural milieu that is so important to who they are”, and ensuring resilience for “an industry that contributes a significant amount to the country’s economy in a very short time.

A BBC Panorama programme broadcast a similar charge on Monday night.Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been under effective house arrest in Tehran since March when she was given temporary release from prison having served four years of a five-year sentence for alleged espionage. She was arrested in Tehran in April 2016.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has alleged that her full release has been held back by the UK’s failure to settle an acknowledged £400m debt over an arms deal with the late shah of Iran.In the letter to Wallace, the lawyers say it is astonishing that International Military Services (IMS), a UK government agency, “continues to raise every possible legal objection to payment of the debt and has plainly failed to engage in constructive dialogue with Tehran”.The letter claims the Foreign Office evades and prevaricates when it is asked the simplest questions on the steps it may be taking to pay the debt, which has been the subject of more than a decade of court disputes.It says a decision to defer the next high court hearing on the debt until 4 November, a day after the US presidential election “in effect plays politics with the lives of British citizens”.The lawyers claim: “The UK government is apparently waiting for implicit permission from the US government to pay the UK’s legally owed debts, payment of which would allow Nazanin (and other innocent British nationals) finally to come home. The message appears to be that the safety of British citizens abroad is subordinate to falling in line with US policy.”The UK stance is somewhat paradoxical, the letter says, in that the US has itself negotiated two prisoner swaps with Iran recently.It also claims British tactics have failed to deter the Tehran regime, saying: “There has been a new wave of forced confessions and prisoners being tortured, a new programme of family members of activists and prisoners being arrested, more instances of second sentences being levelled against cellmates of Nazanin who would otherwise be eligible for release.”Part of the purpose of the letter is to warn the UK government that its actions risk endangering the freedom of more British dual nationals.The letter concludes: “It is important that the UK both honours its legally owed obligations to Iran, but also calls out the Iranian government on its illegal treatment of Nazanin under Iranian law. However, the UK government has done precisely the opposite: obtusely refusing to discharge its legal obligations, whilst remaining silent and appeasing Iran in the face of Tehran’s atrocious abuse of Nazanin’s human rights.”The Ministry of Defence said: “The defence secretary’s position on this matter has not changed. As previous government statements have made clear, we remain committed to securing the immediate and permanent release of all arbitrarily detained dual British nationals in Iran and regularly lobby for their release at the highest levels. This includes through the prime minister, the foreign secretary and the British ambassador in Tehran.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39aa5a0cf6d3dca96a022a5f07169fec01384b4/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2702c83213551178644e6f61435119c 480w","title":"eight in 10 poorer uk families feel worse off since lockdown survey","story":"Families tell of abandoning balanced meals and selling possessions for lack of moneySome families have abandoned balanced meals for lack of money during the coronavirus crisis, while many have faced physical and mental problems, according to a report.The findings underline the disproportionate strain being placed on the poorest households as the UK struggles to deal with the pandemic. In June the Resolution Foundation said that while many low-income families were turning to credit cards to get by under lockdown, many higher-income households were able to save more money as their costs fell.The CPAG and C of E researchers found that costs had gone up for many low-income families, many of whom were having to spend more on food and utilities than before. Meanwhile, many had lost work either as a direct result of the lockdown or the loss of support such as childcare.“We have had to cut down quite a bit, not have the diet we had before when I was trying to make sure that they get a balanced diet. I just manage whatever I can make, really … with fruit and everything being so expensive, you just have to get what’s affordable,” said one parent, named by the researchers as Ann-Marie.Another, named Claire, said: “I went round Lidl with a list and a calculator to try and get everything I possibly could at the lowest possible price. It has just meant worry and stress and anxiety, because as long as you can see a light at the end of the tunnel, it gives you strength to move forwards. We haven’t had that. In terms of financial impact, it’s meant absolutely counting every penny.”The CPAG said it found many children who were eligible for free school meals in England had not been receiving them. It called on the government to extend the scheme to all families in receipt of universal credit or working tax credit, with a view to bringing in universal free school meals for all children in the long term.The charity also said ministers should “increase child benefit by £10 a week and add an extra £10 a week to the child element within universal credit and child tax credits” and “abolish the benefit cap, or at least suspend it for the duration of the pandemic”.The researchers conducted an online survey of 264 low-income families from a range of backgrounds in the UK, and held in-depth interviews with 21 of the families in England, between May and July this year.

Anderson, sitting on 599 career wickets, will not want to wait to become the first seam bowler to pass the milestone.Of greater importance to England’s head coach, however, is completing a 2-0 series win and, after declaring his satisfaction at a day during which just two wickets fell – as the ball went soft, the pitch fell docile and Pakistan’s batsmen dug in – the call was for one final push.Silverwood said: “I’m very proud of how the players have handled themselves, being locked up for the best part of 10 weeks in the bubble. Their attitude and effort during that time has been fantastic.“To finish strong and see Jimmy get his 600th would be fantastic. He’s an inspiration, isn’t he? To have one of the best in the world sat in your dressing room, playing for your country is absolutely amazing. He’s constantly helping the other bowlers and it would be brilliant to see him get over the line.“But I want to win the game – that’s my first and foremost. Weather permitting, let’s give it a good go.”Silverwood insisted the 56 overs of toil on a rain-affected fourth day were “good practice” for overseas assignments when the ball does not move off the straight and he was pleased to see Jofra Archer strive for the speeds asked of him before the match even though the 25-year-old remains wicketless thus far.“I think we’ve seen pace from him this time,” the former Yorkshire and England bowler said. “We talked through his role and we’ve seen what we asked him to do: 90mph and good skill. We all know there is a world-class bowler there.”Ollie Pope, meanwhile, will not take the field on the final day of England’s Test summer and is due to undergo a scan after sustaining an injury to his left shoulder as he slid to prevent a boundary just two overs into the fourth morning.The 22-year-old Surrey batsman, who appeared in considerable discomfort following the tumble and did not reappear, dislocated the same shoulder while playing for his county last summer – a problem that required surgery and led to him missing three months of cricket."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa2ef492fe0c136f4ae3e65364894ba4161a281d/1131_179_3113_1868/master/3113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=730c23537c668d45341a9f278ffab22b","title":"exeter 14 changes top two meeting bristol semi radradra premiership rugby union","story":"It is worth pausing for a second to recall that the last time a Bristol v Exeter fixture attracted as much neutral interest was in the Championship 10 years ago. Those who would scrap promotion to the top ision might care to study the rise of the Premiership’s current leading duo and reflect on the benefits of embracing those who might go on to challenge the status quo in future.What a shame no spectators will be allowed inside the 27,000-capacity Ashton Gate for Tuesday night’s summit meeting which the Bears’ director of rugby, Pat Lam, reckons would otherwise have sold out weeks ago. Leaving aside any nagging player welfare misgivings about midweek matches, there is little question it enhances rugby’s visibility and offers an interesting challenge to players and coaches alike.The only snag is that, with so many held-over games to cram in, the leaders, Exeter, are shorn of the majority of their first-choice starters with Rob Baxter having made 14 starting changes to his lineup following the 32-22 victory at Sale on Friday. The sole survivor is the winger Olly Woodburn with the 11th-hour decision not to risk Jack Nowell prompting a debut for the highly rated England Under-20 full-back Josh Hodge and a switch to outside-centre for the veteran Phil Dollman.Bristol, however, have gone the other way, sticking with the sensational Semi Radradra in the No 13 jersey – Dollman’s first outing since lockdown will be a busy one – alongside Charles Piutau, Kyle Sinckler, Nathan Hughes, Callum Sheedy and Steven Luatua who have all helped to propel the Bears to seven successive Premiership wins since early January. With an eight-point gap between first and second places with seven regular‑season games remaining, this would appear the hosts’ last chance to try to stop Exeter finishing top of the heap.The temptation to rev up Radradra and co again, accordingly, has been too much to resist, with Lam comparing the current league placings to a Formula One race as the top six prepare to meet in grid order – first v second, third v fourth, fifth v sixth – inside 26 hours. “As we know in those F1 races the cars placed one to four have a better chance of winning. But it doesn’t mean it is guaranteed and people will overtake you if you’re not on the money. It is a big and exciting round but there is still a lot of rugby to go.”Baxter takes a similar view – “Whatever happens won’t define the season for either side” – but there is no hiding from Radradra’s significant early impact not just on flailing opponents but his own teammates, not least during the 33-24 win at Gloucester on Friday.“What we’re seeing is just a normal day at the office for Semi,” Lam said. “The X factor he shows is not a surprise to me or people who watch him. It’s what he does all the time but the space he had came from the rest of the boys doing their jobs.”Another secret weapon Lam has been quietly utilising is the coaching brain of his former Northampton and Scotland mentor Ian McGeechan, whom he has invited to come down to Bristol and coach a session. He also rates the on-loan Saracens flanker Ben Earl, a replacement against Exeter, as another reason to be cheerful about English rugby.“When I used to play I thought England always got it wrong with the sort of back-rowers they were selecting,” Lam said. “They used to pick Lawrence Dallaglio sometimes out of position at No 6 or 7 when New Zealand had guys like Michael Jones or Josh Kronfeld. England now have a wealth of options and are picking some great 7s. World rugby has had an unbelievable explosion of back-rowers for people to aspire to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c693ac7f1ad4fa52ab8687220250942f38970ff0/0_16_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=96d278dfe8aa141205ce0d00ca941290","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

Panniers and racks are out the preferred option is now specialist luggage attached to the bike by Velcro and straps in a streamlined set up. “We’ve seen an increase in sales and new customers,” says George Huxford of bag maker Apidura, confirming that, as with the rest of the cycling industry, Covid has had a positive impact on business.While a hedge and a waterproof bivvy bag are the preferred choice of sleeping quarters for hardcore enthusiasts, most bikepackers opt for a bothy or official campsite. This makes bikepacking bang on trend, combining camping with a more enjoyable method of arriving at your pitch than sitting in a car or taking public transport. Cycling UK is a valuable resource, starting with advice on how to plan a simple weekend ride and camp miles from your doorstep.What I’m attempting is certainly on the more extreme side (minus the hedges). An experienced cyclist with a number of 100-mile sportives under my belt, I’m looking to cover the Greater Ridgeway in four days – those looking for a more leisurely ride could choose a shorter section over more time. Four hours in, though, I’m questioning the plans I’d made from the comfort of my front room.Boulder-packed descents, loose gravel climbs and impassable sections of path that look like they haven’t been walked on, let alone ridden, since the stone age mean it’s slow going over Dorset’s undulating countryside. When I find myself 42 miles short of my campsite in Sixpenny Handley with only three hours of daylight left, I need to find a more direct route. Unlike the druids before me, I have the benefit of switching to smooth asphalt roads.I arrive at Church Farm Caravan and Camping Park (pitches from £11.50) as the sun is setting, the tougher travails of the day softened by my catching a glimpse of the Cerne Giant while descending into the village of Cerne Abbas. Hastily assembling my tarp – a sheet that provides the shelter of a tent for a fraction of the weight – in the light of a friendly neighbour’s car headlights, I conclude that I need a plan B. My routes will have to change, allowing me to reach my remaining campsites in daylight, see some more sights and average 90 miles a day. I will cut out some of the winding, time-consuming tracks and trails in favour of the streets of Newbury, Cambridge and Thetford.New routes plotted, I find the riding improves immediately. I have time for a leisurely pit stop at The Bridge Inn, Upper Woodford, north of Salisbury, for coffee and a thick slice of carrot cake, and continue across the Salisbury Plain military training ground (there are various routes, but the clearly marked danger zones should, obviously, be avoided). The views across the hills are breathtaking and I even spy muntjac, hares and pheasants.This was the bikepacking experience I’d hoped for: Wilton Windmill appearing on the hillside from a quiet country lane waving to barges on the canalside paths of the Kennet and tackling the Ridgeway’s woodland trails with hearty helpings of calories every few hours. Reaching White Mark Farm campsite in Watlington (pitches from £8) ahead of schedule, I down a well-earned pint and devour a pizza in the Spire \u0026amp Spoke’s sunny beer garden before I tend to my tarp, queue for my socially distanced shower and bed down for the night as red kites circle above.A 5.30am wakeup call courtesy of that distinctive screech doesn’t dampen my spirits, and I’m soon back in the saddle – a 110-mile epic standing between me and the Kings Forest Caravan Park (adults only, pitches from £15) on the NorfolkSuffolk border. It starts with a rollercoaster ride past Chequers, and by lunchtime I’m grateful to have swapped the punchy peaks of the Chilterns for the pan-flat Fens. The addition of luggage makes the climbs rather harder (an off-piste ascent on Aldbury Common sticks in the mind), but the trick is to embrace bikepacking’s slower nature. The environment then takes on a new vividness, making for a much more rewarding experience.I rise with the sun, the scent of the pine forests lingering while I pack up for the last time. There’s just 50 miles to go and the waves of Norfolk’s coast are pulling me towards the end – even a ford, ripe for a spot of wild swimming in Castle Acre, can’t break their magnetic spell. I grin when I spy the Wash and don’t stop smiling until I reach the sandy beach of Holme-next-the-Sea.After a train ride from King’s Lynn, I’m back grinding through traffic on London’s streets. While my expedition may have got off to a choppy start, I’ve been bitten by the bikepacking bug. I’m plotting my next escape from the city before I even reach my front door.• Charlie Allenby is the author of Bike London (Spring 2021, ACC Art Books).

DeJoy did not dispute the decline and conceded that a recent change he implemented to get USPS trucks to run more on schedule had contributed to the delays. The schedules at mail processing plants, DeJoy said, weren’t aligning with the on-time truck schedules, leading some mail to be delivered late.“While we have had temporary service declines, which should not have happened, we are fixing this,” DeJoy said. DeJoy conceded on Monday he was still trying to figure out why the problems had persisted over weeks. DeJoy offered few details on what analyses, if any, USPS had done before implementing the program to try and get trucks to run on time.The postmaster general also reiterated a pledge he made Friday during a US Senate hearing that USPS, the federal agency, has the capacity to deliver mail-in ballots this fall and that delivering them in a timely way was a priority for the agency. But he offered few details on what exactly USPS would do to facilitate timely delivery of ballots in the run-up to the election.In one remarkable exchange with congresswoman Katie Porter, a California Democrat, DeJoy was unable to supply basic information about post office costs. While he correctly told Porter the price of a stamp was 55 cents, he conceded that he did not know the cost of sending a postcard in the US (it costs 35 cents).“I’ll submit that I know very little about postage stamps,” DeJoy said. He also said he was unaware of how many people voted by mail in the last election, even as he pledged USPS had the capacity to safely deliver ballots. Just over 31 million voters cast ballots by mail in the 2018 midterm election, about a quarter of all ballots cast.“I’m glad you know the price of a stamp, but I’m concerned about your understanding of this agency,” Porter said. “I’m concerned about it because you started taking very decisive action when you became postmaster general.”Nonetheless, Republicans on the committee sought to downplay the delays and offered full-throated support of DeJoy during the hearing. They noted USPS has long suffered from financial woes and portrayed DeJoy as an outsider qualified to overhaul the agency.David Williams, a former member of the USPS board of governors, told House members last week that DeJoy did not appear to be a “serious candidate” for postmaster general when the board interviewed him. He struggled to answer basic questions, Williams said, and another governor had to step in and complete answers for him.Some of the hearing’s most tense moments came when Democrats pressed DeJoy about potential conflicts of interest or political interference at the agency. When congressman Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, asked DeJoy whether he had provided extra compensation to employees who donated to Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, DeJoy said he had not. “I resent the assertion sir. What are you accusing me of?” he said.Cooper asked DeJoy whether his “backup plan” was to be “pardoned like Roger Stone”, referring to the Republican fixer and Trump confidant who had a prison sentence for felonies relating to the Trump-Russia investigation commuted by the president. DeJoy shook his head and said: “I have no comment on that. It’s not worth a comment.”DeJoy did make some commitments to ensuring ballots cast in the fall would be counted. The agency has long advised states to put ballots in the mail at least a week before election day, but DeJoy said the agency would expedite mail cast closer to election day. There have also been issues with ballots arriving at election offices without postmarks – a crucial feature to determine whether they can be counted – and DeJoy said the agency was going to try and implement a system to postmark as much as possible.Throughout the hearing, DeJoy said that he would not restore hundreds of sorting machines that have reportedly been removed from postal facilities across the country. When Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, asked him why he wouldn’t restore the machines if it meant restoring confidence in the election, DeJoy simply said “because they’re not needed. That’s why.”Khanna later got DeJoy to concede that restoring the machines would likely cost less than $1bn. Asked whether the machines could be restored if USPS got an additional $1bn, DeJoy said: “Get me the billion and I’ll put the machines in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04268c02a4aeb41dc7d15c3a4e5718d76918e15/0_92_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d50d75cb57dcfa102ad8974cad21c1c","title":"flordelis case brazil evangelical preacher politician accusations","story":"Singer-turned politician known as Flordelis was alleged ringleader of lurid family plot to kill husband, including poisoning himA gospel-singing Brazilian congresswoman has been accused of masterminding the “barbaric” murder of her preacher husband after at least six failed or aborted attempts to kill him with poison or in staged robberies.Anderson do Carmo was 42 when he was shot dead in June 2019 as he returned to the home he shared with the church crooner-turned-politician Flordelis dos Santos de Souza.The celebrity congresswoman, who congregants and fans call simply Flordelis, claimed her husband – with whom she had famously raised more than 50 children – had been slain by thieves.But allegations of a bizarre and lurid family plot to murder the evangelical preacher emerged on Monday as police arrested five of Flordelis’ children and one granddaughter for involvement in the crime.The 59-year-old lawmaker – who has made records for one of Brazil’s top gospel labels and was elected to congress in 2018 – could not be arrested because she enjoys parliamentary immunity.But investigators said they had no doubt Flordelis, who reportedly wept uncontrollably as police raided her home, was the ringleader.“The conclusion the investigation reached was this: that she planned this cowardly murder,” the homicide chief Antônio Ricardo Lima Nunes told reporters as the singer’s handcuffed relatives were led away by heavily armed officers.“The motive was that she was unhappy with the way in which pastor Anderson lived his life and handled the family finances.”Do Carmo’s grisly murder – he was reportedly shot more than 30 times, predominantly in the groin and thighs – made nationwide headlines and has continued to do so since.Brazilian newspapers have published a succession of sensational allegations, including that the evangelical couple frequented a swingers club in west Rio where the singer was spotted in a state of inebriation. Flordelis denied those claims and has repeatedly denied involvement in her husband’s murder.“Let’s say we were surprised by today’s events,” her lawyer, Anderson Rollemberg, told the website UOL on Monday.Police, however, say they are sure she was the architect of his killing.Monday’s pre-dawn round-up was dubbed “Operation Luke 12” – a reference to the New Testament chapter in which Jesus tells his disciples: “There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.”Local reports alleged the conspiracy began in May 2018, when scheming relatives began secretly spiking pastor Anderson’s food with arsenic. It ended just over a year later, in the early hours of 16 June 2019, when the preacher’s body was riddled with bullets at the couple’s home in Niterói, a city near Rio.In the intervening period newspapers claimed there were at least five other failed or aborted attempts on his life, either by poisoning his food and drinks or staging robberies.One of the congresswoman’s daughters, Simone, was found to have trawled the internet for information on “cyanide in food” but claimed that was merely out of curiosity and to help a friend whose dog had a tumour.The O Globo newspaper reported that the pastor had actually discovered plans to murder him and threatened to bug all of the telephones in the family home, forcing the plotters to communicate with burner phones.Flordelis was born and raised in Jacarezinho, a sprawling Rio favela, where she began her singing career and met her future husband in the early 1990s. The couple went on to found a church together – the Ministry of Flordelis – and became famous for their huge family which was made up of 55 children, the majority adopted.Flordelis used her celebrity as a springboard into politics and was one of Rio’s most-voted federal lawmakers in 2018 with nearly 200,000 votes. “I’m going to fight for the family, for life and for women,” she vowed as she took office.“It was a barbaric, cowardly crime,” he told breakfast TV.Just a week earlier Flordelis had posted a photograph to Instagram – where she has nearly one million followers – in which she appeared straddling a camel with her late husband during a trip to Israel.“I still feel lost … part of me died with you … I feel a mixture of pain and disgust – what they did to you was so cruel,” she wrote before signing off: “I love you my Baby”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1199f987999f45a5f91b7e208570ac216edc2bb7/0_91_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8bf76f1e260cc371517266c111cff55d","title":"coronavirus live news gaza in lockdown following first local cases hong kong man re infected","story":"Four cases detected in Gaza outside of quarantine facilities First known case of re-infection prompts immunity concerns Usain bolt tests positive for Covid-19.

He had earlier posted a video on social media saying he was waiting to hear back on his results – before urging anyone who had come into contact with him recently to enter quarantine.Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness Dr Christopher Tufton reportedly confirmed Bolt had been notified of the positive test and contact tracing was underway: South Korea on Tuesday ordered most schools in Seoul and surrounding areas to close and move classes back online, the latest in a series of precautionary measures aimed at heading off a resurgence in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 280 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Monday, bringing the country’s total to 17,945 with 310 deaths.That represents a drop in daily new infections from 397 reported as of midnight Saturday, the highest daily tally since early March. With most of the new cases centred in the densely populated capital area, however, health authorities say the country is on the brink of a nation-wide outbreak and have called on people to stay home and limit travel.All students, except for high school seniors, in the cities of Seoul and Incheon and the province of Geonggi will take classes online until 11 September, the Ministry of Education said on Tuesday.The beginning of the spring semester had been postponed several times since March, but as daily coronavirus cases dropped sharply since a February peak, most of South Korea’s schools reopened in stages between 20 May and 1 June.Over the past two weeks, at least 150 students and 43 school staff have tested positive in the greater Seoul area, Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae told a briefing.The world-famous Australian building is enjoying a brief moment of rest amid the coronavirus crisis.

In Wales, there were 240.1 physical abuse offences recorded per 10,000 11- to 18-year-olds, compared with 70.5 per 10,000 aged under 11.World-record sprinter and eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt has tested positive for the coronavirus and is self-isolating at his home in Jamaica after last week celebrating his 34th birthday with a big bash mask-free, Reuters reports. Jamaica’s health ministry confirmed late on Monday that Bolt, who holds world records in the 100m and 200m distance, had tested positive after he posted a video on social media around midday saying he was waiting to hear back on his results.“Just to be safe I quarantined myself and just taking it easy,” Bolt said in the message that he appeared to have taped himself while lying in bed. It was posted with the caption “Stay safe my ppl”.The only sprinter to win the 100m and 200m golds at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016) said he did not have any symptoms of Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.Bolt said he took the test on Saturday, the day after he celebrated his birthday at a bash where partygoers danced to the hit “Lockdown” by Jamaican reggae singer Koffee.Daily confirmed cases in Jamaica have surged to more than 60 per day over the past four days from less than 10 just a few weeks ago. Jamaica now has 1,612 confirmed cases, with 622 active cases and 16 deaths from coronavirus.Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, announced on Tuesday that eight people died from the new coronavirus in the last 24 hours and reported 148 new cases.The state a day earlier reported 15 deaths from the virus and 116 cases, its lowest daily rise in new infections in seven weeks, Reuters reports. A flare up in infections in Victoria forced authorities in to tighten restrictions on people’s movements and order large parts of the state’s economy to close but the southeast state has seen a slowdown in new cases in recent days.Moving away from the US now: Mexican authorities said Monday they have started price-gouging investigations to sanction 420 businesses, including stores and funeral homes, for unfairly raising prices during the coronavirus pandemic, AP reports. The consumer protection office said hundreds of grocery stores and retailers allegedly failed to respect posted prices or changed them, or charged too much for items including basic food stuffs as well as goods that are in high demand because of the pandemic, including rubbing alcohol, hand sanitiser and face masks.Punishments for unjustified price increases can include fines and other administrative measures. Those to be sanctioned also include 63 funeral homes, many of which apparently did not respect prior contracts.But authorities excused one of the most flagrant examples of price hikes, saying that a two- or three-fold increase in prices for bottled oxygen was largely the fault of consumers who bought supplies of the gas they didnt need, just to have it on hand in case someone fell sick.Mexico has seen over 560,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 60,500 Covid-19 deaths, the third-highest total in the world.More from Reuters on Biden and coronavirus testing: Reporters have frequently asked Biden whether he has been tested for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and he has always answered no.He has criticised President Donald Trump’s handling of the virus, which has killed more than 176,000 Americans, as disastrous.During campaign appearances, many broadcast online, Biden consistently wears masks and maintains distance to show his adherence to public health guidelines.By contrast, Trump, 74, who will face Biden in the 3 November election, downplayed the virus in its early stages, once referred to mask-wearing as politically correct and has been reluctant to wear a face covering himself.Trump in July wore a mask in public for the first time during the pandemic, a shift in his tone to encourage Americans to wear them as the country began to see a resurgence of cases.Meanwhile, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, will be tested regularly for Covid-19, an aide said on Monday, as the campaign prepares for the possibility of more public events in the run-up to November’s election, Reuters reports. Since the coronavirus began spreading widely in the United States in March, Biden has done few public events, most of them close to his Delaware home.But following his formal nomination at last week’s Democratic National Convention, the campaign is expanding its health protocols in a new phase of the race that could see the former vice president in closer proximity to the public.“Consistent with the transparency Vice President Biden has demonstrated, we will make public if either the Vice President or Senator Harris ever has a confirmed, positive case of Covid-19,” a campaign aide told Reuters.The aide said Biden, 77, Harris, 55, and key staff who interact with them would be tested “on a regular basis,” in line with the advice of medical advisers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337860.1598295573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost half of secondary schools can t find builders for covid linked work","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlmost three quarters of teachers do not believe that students have the required technology to take part in remote learning if their school was required to close for a period, the poll found. Photograph: iStockAlmost half of all secondary schools in the State are having problems hiring builders to carry out works to allow for Covid-19 physical distancing rules, a new survey suggests.On the back of the findings, the Teachers Union of Ireland is insisting on delaying the reopening of any schools which cannot safely space out teachers and pupils over the coming days and weeks.Michael Gillespie, TUI general secretary, warned extended closures are the “only acceptable option” where schools cannot strictly enforce public health measures.“Should a school not be in a position to open as scheduled in a manner consistent with the physical distancing requirements set out by the public health authorities, a delay in opening is the only acceptable option,” he said.“There can be no departure from the specified physical distancing measures in schools. Every school must adhere to this key protection.”The union has polled principals and deputy principals at 124 schools between August 11th and August 18th. It found 47 per cent of schools were having difficulties “employing builders or other contractors with the required skillsexpertise to make required adjustments”.Health issuesThe survey also found 66 per cent of principals and deputy principals who responded are aware of teachers in their schools with underlying health issues that puts them in the high-risk category for contracting Covid-19.Almost three quarters (73 per cent) knew teachers in their school who live with family members with medical conditions that make them extremely vulnerable to the disease.“This is a hugely stressful time for them,” said Mr Gillespie.The vast majority of school heads (95 per cent) believe their teachers want to return to face-to-face teaching and learning, but that it must be done “in a manner that protects the health and safety of all”.Almost three quarters (73 per cent) do not believe that students have the required technology to take part in remote learning if their school was required to close for a period, the poll found.Substitute teachersThe survey further suggests that virtually every school (98 per cent) in the country has had difficulties employing substitute teachers over the the past 12 months.Adrian Power, president of the Principals’ and Deputy Principals’ Association branch of the TUI, said the lack of supply teachers was a cause for concern.“This will undoubtedly pose problems in the coming months should the need arise due to absences and there will be an ongoing need for funding from the Department of Education,” he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337811.1598291703!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"back to school preparations the minister is bogged down with letters from us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKildorrery National School: ‘Everyone’s anxious to get back at this stage’School principals around Ireland are scrambling to get classrooms ready for the new term, but for Rachel Kelly, in the north Cork village of Kildorrery, the task has been compounded by delays in building works that have forced the school out of its grounds for more than a year.The primary school had to relocate last August when one of the workers replacing the roof of the building fell and was critically injured. Brian McGrath, a 39-year-old father of three from Mitchelstown, died a week later in hospital. The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) closed the site to investigate the incident and because asbestos in the lining of the roof had been disturbed. Staff had just two weeks to get their new home, 20km away at Mallow GAA complex, ready for about 200 pupils.It takes 20-25 minutes to bus pupils and staff back and forth from Kildorrery, with the lost time forcing the school to cut back on extracurricular activities. Covid-19 guidelines have added further challenges given the need to minimise interaction between classes. The Department of Education is not providing additional buses to allow for social distancing. However, after repeated requests, the department has agreed to lay on two extra buses so children can be collected en route and to enable the school to resume its normal tuition time.Substitute teachersKelly believes the biggest challenge Covid-19 will present for the school will be the availability of substitute teachers. The department has promised an additional €41 million to help primary schools with cover for the likely rise in sick leave, with 250 posts being allocated to new supply panels. Kelly says at times it can be “impossible” to get substitutes for their 11 teachers.Kildorrery is one of several hundred schools undergoing works before reopening. Department figures show seven schools had “large-scale projects” completed up to July 31st this year, with more than 340 in progress.A spokeswoman for the department said 405 projects were approved under the summer works scheme this year at a projected cost of €30 million, of which more than 50per cent “are either completed on site, in construction activity or have been given approval to commence work on site”.There have been 253 applications approved for the emergency works scheme and they are “at various stages of completion”.Kelly says “parents are disappointed, they’re angry, they’re frustrated, as are the staff and the board of management” with the ongoing uncertainty over the works in Kildorrery. “The Minister is bogged down with letters from us.”“We were told initially that we’d be out of Kildorrery for 12 weeks. That was last August.”School roofOne of the major reasons for the delay was the school roof being left open when the site was closed off, and there was a “huge amount of water damage done over the winter”.Work on the roof did not restart until December but was largely complete when, in March, Covid-19 restrictions led to all construction stopping until mid-May. The roof was finished shortly after work recommenced, but only then was the extent of the damage fully assessed.Contractors had to be brought in to remove any remaining asbestos, and a separate tender process for what is now a full refurbishment began.Local Labour TD Seán Sherlock says he would like to see temporary accommodation on Kildorrery grounds being considered. “That would have alleviated a lot of the stress for parents and for children.”The department refused that request last August and again in the summer, saying it did “not represent value for money”.A department spokesman said it “fully appreciates that the additional delays . . . are extremely disappointing and frustrating for the entire school community. However, we can assure the local community that the school is doing everything it can to ensure the earliest possible return to the school.”Staff and children will be returning to Mallow in September but they don’t know for how long. Management has been given a 12-16 week estimate for the school refurbishment once the work begins, but that has yet to happen.“Everyone’s anxious to get back at this stage,” says Kelly. “They’ve told us we’ll have a state-of-the-art school when we go back. We’ll just have ride out the storm and hopefully we’ve only one more hurdle in front of us.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337818.1598293036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 and teachers i am paranoid anxious and cautious","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeacher with health issues was given a report stating he was “high risk” and not “very high risk”, so he would be expected at his desk when school reopened.

It is a very anxious time,” says Tomas (to protect his identity we are not using his real name), a 60-year-old secondary school teacher ordered to return to work next week despite having cancer and a heart condition, which leave him at high risk of contracting Covid-19.Last week, he filled out the online risk assessment for returning to school, which he believed, because of his renal carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer for which he had part of his kidney removed last year, and his angioplasty and stent insertion, would allow him to work from home.As part of the process, he was asked for an up-to-date report from his consultant.“Let’s just say he’d prefer if I didn’t return to the workplace,” he said.Just days later a report was emailed back to him stating that he was simply “high risk” and not “very high risk”, so he would be expected at his desk when the school gates reopened.The only advice was to socially distance and take the appropriate hygiene measures.Bolt from blue“It was a bolt out of the blue, considering my conditions,” he said. “I do want to go back to work sometime but I don’t feel now is the appropriate time.”A teacher for 40 years, Tomas has been cocooning to protect himself at home since the start of the pandemic. His wife and two children, with whom he lives, have also been limiting their social contacts because of his illnesses.With his medical conditions, he has been “paranoid, anxious and cautious” about coronavirus.Now, faced with having to mix with large groups of children and adults in his school, where “space is very much limited”, he says a “plethora of worries” are weighing on him.“It’s not safe at the moment,” he said.“I’m particularly worried about the areas in the school that become congested at times.‘Lax with time’“I know we’ll all be very careful at the start, but people will get more lax in time. Kids are kids, and they have to be kids.”Break times are another concern, he says, adding that he is worried about the impact the stress will have on his ability to focus on his teaching.“Normally, when you go to work you just worry about work – now I have this other worry hovering over my head.“It seems to be a fait accompli.“My worst fear is that I will contract Covid and all the risks that go with that, even developing another serious illness from contracting it. From the information we have at the moment, you could be knocked out for months and no one knows the long-term effects of the disease.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Diesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the centuryOne Change: We need to rethink the value we place on the natural environment"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337823.1598293373!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clifden golf dinner former junior minister %C3%A1ine brady apologises for attendance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer junior minister Aine Brady is chief executive of Third Age, the organisation that supports older people in Ireland. File photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Former junior minister Áine Brady has apologised for attending the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Clifden, Co Galway last week, describing it as a distraction from the work of her charity. Ms Brady is chief executive of Third Age, the organisation that supports older people in Ireland. She became the latest of the more than 80 guests at the controversial event to publicly acknowledge her error and apologise. The dinner was held by the society after it hosted two days of golf at the nearby Connemara Golf Course in Ballyconneely, Co Galway. The event was attended by several TDs and senators, along with former TDs and senators.Ms Brady had accompanied her husband Gerry, who had played in the golf tournament, to the function in Clifden.Third Age did not immediately supply a comment from Ms Brady when contacted but in a statement reported by the Leinster Leader, she said she wished to sincerely apologise. “I am disappointed that my actions may have distracted from the tremendous work that the organisation does, and I will re-double my efforts to ensure that these programmes will continue to deliver positive outcomes for older people and communities in Ireland,” she said. “I unreservedly apologise and deeply regret my attendance at last week’s event.”Ms Brady lost her Kildare North seat in the 2011 general election, having represented the constituency as a Fianna Fail TD since 2007.She became minister of state with responsibility for older people in April 2009 and was appointed head of Third Age 2013. On Monday morning, another former TD, Dr Michael Harty also apologised for his attendance. Media interviews with those at the dinner have been rare but Dr Harty told his local station Clare FM that he had made an error of judgment and did not initially suspect there was anything wrong with the event. He said he was not aware of the changes to Covid guidelines made the day before which further limited indoor gatherings. “I turned off completely in relation to what was going on in the outside world for two days,” he said. “I have been working hard in relation to this pandemic for the past six months since it started at the beginning of February and ya, I let my guard down.”He said he should have known something was amiss when he walked into the room and used his common sense but he assumed the dinner was in compliance with the rules. He explained he was not a member of the “tight knit” committee group who organised the meal and that he “certainly would have seen the dangers” if he had been. “I walked into a trap basically. I walked into a room which looked fine the tables were distanced. I didn’t see any difficulty.”The former Clare independent TD and GP, said he intended to learn from his mistakes which have cost him personally and professionally. “I acknowledge the hurt and distress that it has caused and has undermined the commitment and sacrifice that everyone has been making during this pandemic,” he said.

Video: RTE\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActing Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn during a press briefing at Government Buildings in Dublin. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireThe State’s public health emergency team has issued a “note of caution” about rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in Dublin where people should take “extra care” to prevent spreading the virus.There were a further 147 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team, including 73 in Dublin. No further deaths were reported. This brings total confirmed cases to 28,116 with the death toll from the virus remaining at 1,777. Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn told a press briefing that there was not a major problem with rising cases in Dublin over the last number of days but that it was “something that we are watching closely.”“It is not an alarm it is simply a note of caution for people to take care and take all the basic measures,” he said, referring to the long-standing public health measures that people should follow and last week’s specific guidance to avoid house parties and other larger gatherings.The increased cases in Dublin were spread across the county but the number of infections were “slightly higher” in Dublin West, Dublin North West and Dublin North Central, he said. “Unlike what we saw in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, there isn’t one or two defined clusters guiding this in Dublin. It is spread out across areas, across settings, across workplaces and with a significant proportion of community transmission,” he said. One in three Dublin cases are from community transmission, which is higher than one-in-five national average. Some 34 of the 73 Dublin cases are close contacts of other Covid-19 cases.There was “no suggestion” that a county lockdown or any further restrictions were needed in Dublin and that if people followed guidance, the benefits would be seen next week, said Dr Glynn. Countrywide, there were 27 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals, including six in critical care units, and that this was up from 17 last Thursday. “We do need to monitor that very closely,” said Dr Glynn.He challenged claims from some commentators that the pandemic was now a “case-demic”, that public health officials should “stop worrying” and that “the virus has weakened.” “That is simply not the case,” he said. If cases kept rising, “it will only be a matter of time before it spreads into other groups,” he said. Dr Mary Favier, president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, acknowledged the anxiety amongst parents with schools reopening this week.She said parents should not worry about children who “have a runny nose for every single day of winter” but should “start to pay attention” when children have a high temperature, a cough or other respiratory symptoms and should keep them home for 48 hours until symptoms settle.Dr Glynn said it “won’t be a surprise” if there are cases among schoolchildren but the challenge was “to response to that appropriately and listen to the appropriate information sources.”There were 84 children under the age of 14 last week who tested positive for Covid-19 and overall children under 14 accounted for less than three per cent of cases.“The vast, vast majority who have Covid have very mild, if any symptoms,” he said. “If we can suppress this and keep this low in our community, we can protect our children and protect our education system.”Dr Glynn said he didn’t believe that it was possible to pursue a strategy to eliminate Covid-19 completely and that Nphet’s strategy was to “keep the cases as low as possible” and to protect education, vulnerable people and healthcare. Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that alternative testing methods were being evaluated for children, including saliva testing.Some 57,670 Covid-19 tests were conducted last week with a 1.3 per cent positivity rate.There were two new Covid-19 outbreaks reported at direct provision centres, in Bray and in Limerick and eight new cases spread over all eight outbreaks in these centres. Separately, another 10 cases of Covid-19 have been reported across Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours.There have been no more deaths.The first pupils have returned to schools across Northern Ireland since the coronavirus lockdown started in March. Some parents have expressed concerns while teachers’ unions say educators had not been given enough time to respond to rules issued earlier this month. Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride has insisted it is safe to return.

The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe European Commission chiefs were last night examining the account given by EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan about his movements in Ireland before and after a golf dinner amid a growing belief in Dublin and Brussels that his position is under threat.Senior Government sources expect clarification in the coming hours from European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen who yesterday asked for further information from Mr Hogan just hours after he submitted a dossier on his movements.It has emerged that following Ms von der Leyen’s request there were “further contacts” but an EU source last night sounded a pessimistic note saying they “could not say whether she received all clarifications or not”.It is understood Ms von der Leyen wants to be “thorough” and does not want to rush her assessment.There are growing doubts among senior Ministers that Mr Hogan can hold on to his role as EU trade commissioner. He came under pressure after it emerged that initial statements by his spokesman claiming he travelled “directly” from Co Kilkenny to the controversial Oireachtas Golf Society event in Co Galway were incorrect.Mr Hogan’s team have since admitted he returned to Co Kildare on his way to the golf event to collect items from his residence at the K-Club and was stopped by gardaí in the county for using his mobile phone while driving.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has called on Mr Hogan to give the public absolute assurances that he did not break coronavirus restrictions.“That to me would be very, very serious indeed,” said Mr Martin.“The public need to know that restrictions in Kildare were not breached,” he added. The county was in lockdown at the time of the golf event in Galway last week and continues to remain so.Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said earlier that Mr Hogan should resign.He also said the commissioner has to be “really clear about his whereabouts and his actions over that period of time. The drip feed of information is less than helpful, I still don’t think he understands how angry people are about this and rightly so.”European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant said it was “important that rules are respected. This is a matter not just on respecting the rules but this is also a matter of public health. There are legal aspects involved and there are moral aspects involved as well.”She added that “it is important of course for the president that rules are respected in respect to coronavirus rules and quarantine regulations . . . It is essential that all facts are being provided, are being put on the table with the necessary clarifications and details.”‘Justifiably angry’Meanwhile, the State’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said he did not think the anger over Mr Hogan’s behaviour last week would affect the public solidarity needed to prevent the spread of Covid-19.He understood that people are “justifiably angry” about what happened and there “can’t be any excuses” when it “shouldn’t haven’t happened”. But he felt that once people take a step back they will realise the importance of following the public health measures.“I don’t think solidarity will be affected by this, current anger notwithstanding,” he said.Dr Glynn also sounded a “note of caution” about Covid-19 cases increasing in Dublin.There were a further 147 confirmed cases of the disease reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Monday, including 73 in Dublin. No further deaths were reported.The increased cases in Dublin were spread across the county but the number of infections were “slightly higher” in Dublin west, Dublin northwest and Dublin north central, he said.“Unlike what we saw in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, there isn’t one or two defined clusters guiding this in Dublin.

Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"british museum removes bust slave owner founder sir hans sloane","story":"The British Museum has removed a bust of its founding father from its pedestal and labelled him a “slave owner” in an attempt to confront its links to colonialism, the institution’s director has announced.Sir Hans Sloane’s likeness has instead been placed in a secure cabinet alongside artefacts that explain his work in the “exploitative context of the British Empire”.The decision was signed off by Hartwig Fischer, the museum director, and revealed in an interview in The Daily  on Monday.“We have pushed him off the pedestal,” Mr Fischer said. “We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge.”It is part of a wider process of acknowledging the museum’s links to slavery, curators said.Other artefacts, including those taken by Captain James Cook on his voyages, will be given new labels explaining how they were acquired by the museum through “colonial conquest and military looting”. Mr Fischer said: “Dedication to truthfulness when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The case dedicated to Hans Sloane and his relationship to slavery is a very important step in this.“We have pushed him off the pedestal where nobody looked at him, and placed him in the limelight.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history.”The decision to revisit Sloane’s past was made during lockdown in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, which sparked debate around statues of controversial historical figures in public spaces. In June, a statue of Edward Colston was removed from its plinth by protesters in Bristol.The Rhodes Must Fall campaign in Oxford also successfully called for the removal of a statue of philanthropist Cecil Rhodes.Neal Spencer, keeper of Nile and Mediterranean objects and the curator behind the new Sloane display, said that “Black Lives Matter provides a certain level of urgency”.He added: “It’s expected of museums today. The collection is owned by the public in the widest sense.“We want to be upfront about Sloane’s collection being at the root of the British Museum. And we want to put it in a wider context, which is obviously a very difficult context.“It happened in the exploitative context of the British Empire. I wouldn’t describe it as an imperialist organisation, but it is a museum that was founded within the context of Empire.“Eventually we’re going to be redisplaying the whole British Museum. We want to tell more of these stories.“We want to talk more about the context of how the museum was founded.”Sloane’s collection of 71,000 artefacts became the starting point of the British Museum after being bequeathed to the state in his will.The Irish-born collector, known for London street names such as Sloane Square, and being the purported inventor of drinking chocolate, also had investments in the slave-trading Royal African and South Sea Companies.These facts are now noted on labels beside his terracotta bust, which is surrounded by tokens of the slave trade and its legacy.A panel beside Sloane’s bust explains that this collection was “enabled by the wealth and networks that grew out of European imperialism”.New labels also state that this bequeathed hoard contained “anatomical specimens relating to skin colour and theories of racial difference”.While the origins of the foundational collection are being examined, a new “trail” for visitors will allow them to move through the museum on a themed tour of 16 objects unjustly taken from far-flung places in the days of Empire.This trail will not include the Parthenon Marbles – also known as the Elgin Marbles – which have long been the subject of demands for repatriation to Greece after being taken from the Acropolis in the early 19th century.Mr Fischer is determined that in the coming years the long-term commitment of the museum to being open about its imperial heritage will lead to an overhaul in the information available to members of the public visiting in future.He said: “This is not just about empire and colonialism, and European expansion across the world in the last 500 years.“It is also setting this in the wider context of human history.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"five speeches watch republican convention","story":"The annual Republican Convention gets underway this week without the packed stadiums that the political spectacle usually involves.However, Donald Trump has reportedly requested a blockbuster convention with made-for-TV speeches and celebrations across the four-day event.The political jamboree represents a crucial opportunity for Mr Trump, who is trailing in national and battleground state polls and under intense pressure to turn the race around.Here is a brief summary of the five key speeches to watch.The US president\u0027s speech on Thursday night is expected to be the biggest event of the week, with Mr Trump setting out his vision for what his second term in office would look like. With Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent, framing the election as a referendum on Mr Trump\u0027s presidency, he will also seek to highlight his greatest achievements over the last four years.No stranger to controversy, Mr Trump is delivering his speech to a crowd from the White House, blurring the lines between governing and campaigning. Mr Trump\u0027s critics say the use of the White House for party political events represents an abuse of power, but Mr Trump\u0027s defenders insist he is simply choosing to work from his home - like most of the nation - during the pandemic.Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador, will be one of the closest watched speeches when she takes the convention stage. Ms Haley, the first Indian-American and first female governor of South Carolina, is a skilled politician and widely seen as a future presidential candidate. Indeed, such is her popularity within the party there was some anticipation that Mr Trump would choose her as his running mate for his re-election. Ms Haley achieved the rare feat of managing to leave the administration and offering occasional critiques of Mr Trump without falling foul of him. Expect her speech to offer an early insight into what a future presidential run might look like. The president\u0027s eldest son has been the most politically active member of the Trump family since his father entered the White House and Donald Trump Jnr has hinted that he is interested in running for office himself in the future.Donald Jnr\u0027s fiery rhetoric, his active presence on social media and his ability to connect with the Republican base have made him a rising star within the party. His speech at the convention on Monday night offers a test-run for his future political ambitions.Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, plans to record his speech to the convention from Jerusalem. It is a highly unusual move which has already been heavily criticised by some in the region as well as in the US for mixing diplomacy with partisan politics. Mr Pompeo, who is seen as a potential future leader of the Republican Party, has a clear aim in mind with such a setting: appealing to evangelical Christian voters.The Trump administration\u0027s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and to move the US embassy there is seen as one of its signature foreign policy achievements among the Republican Party\u0027s conservative base. Mr Pompeo\u0027s speech will be a nod to that accomplishment.A white couple from St Louis, Missouri who made headlines for aiming guns at Black Lives Matter protesters in June are likely to be the most headline-grabbing speakers outside of the political speeches.Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, were charged with unlawful use of a weapon after they waved a handgun and an AR-15 at protesters and yelled at them to move on. Donald Trump, who has been critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, condemned the investigation into the couple\u0027s actions. The McCloskeys\u0027 case has been taken up by the political right and championed by gun rights activists.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no amount caffeine safe pregnant women experts call radical","story":"No amount of caffeine is safe in pregnancy or for women trying for a baby, research suggests.Current guidelines suggest that such women can safely drink around two cups of instant coffee a day without affecting their unborn baby\u0027s health.But a review of almost 50 studies, published in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, suggests there is no safe level of caffeine consumption in such circumstances.Researchers called for a radical revision of current health guidelines - advising those who are pregnant or trying to conceive to cut out caffeine entirely.Scientists examined 48 observational studies and meta-analyses which examined links between caffeine and up to six negative pregnancy outcomes. These were miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight or size, preterm birth, childhood acute leukaemia, and childhood obesity.A total of 42 separate findings were reported of these 32 found that caffeine significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and 10 found no or inconclusive associations.Professor Jack James of Reykjavik University, Iceland, said: Caffeine-related risk was reported with moderate to high levels of consistency for all pregnancy outcomes except preterm birth.”Fourteen of the studies linked maternal caffeine consumption with increased risk of four adverse outcomes: miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, and childhood acute leukaemia.The studies were observational, meaning they could not prove that caffeine intake caused the risk. However, researchers said it was likely that caffeine was the cause, as the chance of negative outcomes increased depending on how much was drunk. No level of caffeine consumption was found to be free of risk. Until now, pregnant women have been advised until now that consuming a small amount of caffeine daily will not harm their baby.The NHS and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both suggest that the safe limit is 200 mg caffeine, which is the equivalent to around two cups of moderate-strength coffee per day.Professor James said such advice “is not consistent with the level of threat” shown by the research.He said: “Current health recommendations concerning caffeine consumption during pregnancy are in need of radical revision. Specifically, the cumulative scientific evidence supports pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy being advised to avoid caffeine.”Caffeine is a stimulant and can increase blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormones.  A number of studies on caffeine have had contradictory results, with some research suggesting that more than 200g a day can double the risk of miscarriage, while other studies found that up to 300g was safe. Scientists said women who drank a lot of caffeine might be more likely to have unhealthy habits, which might not be fully taken into account. Dr Daghni Rajasingham, Consultant Obstetrician and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “The findings of this study add to the large body of evidence that supports limited caffeine intake during pregnancy, but pregnant women do not need to completely cut out caffeine, as this paper suggests.“As the study notes, high levels of caffeine during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage and babies having a low birth weight, and may lead to excess weight gain in the child’s early years, which can increase risk of health problems later in life. However, as other – and potentially more reliable - research has found, pregnant women do not need to cut caffeine out entirely because these risks are extremely small, even if the recommended caffeine limits are exceeded.“The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ advise to limit caffeine intake to 200 milligrams (mg) per day – the equivalent to two cups of instant coffee – still stands. This paper does not supersede all the other evidence that has found that a limited intake of caffeine is safe for the majority of pregnant women.”Dr Adam Jacobs, Associate Director of Biostatistics, Premier Research, said: “Given that pregnant women have been advised to avoid excessive caffeine consumption for at least the last 40 years, you might expect that women who drink coffee during pregnancy are generally less likely to follow health advice, and possibly in some ways which are quite hard to measure. “Overall, I think if I were a pregnant woman, I don\u0027t think this paper would make me overly concerned about drinking the occasional cup of coffee.”Prof Andrew Shennan, Professor of Obstetrics, King\u0027s College London, said it was possible that women were under-estimating their coffee consumption, and said it remained clear that high doses of caffeine did most harm. “It is well known that women may report lower intake then actual consumption in studies and could explain why lower caffeine intake looks harmful,” he said. “The authors conclude the advice from health bodies such as the NHS needs to radically change and they advise avoiding all caffeine. However the observational nature of this data with its inherent bias does not indicate with any certainty that low doses of caffeine are harmful, and the current advice to avoid high doses of caffeine are unlikely to change.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"re infected hong kong man catches covid twice four half months","story":"The world’s first case of a patient being reinfected with Covid-19 has been confirmed, leading to fears that vaccines may not work. Researchers at the University of Hong Kong sequenced the virus in a healthy man, who tested positive twice at airport screenings four and half months apart, and found he had been infected with two different strains.The Chinese scientists said it showed that long-term immunity cannot be guaranteed, and that people who have already had the virus still needed to comply with social distancing, wearing masks and vaccination.British researchers also said it cast doubt on whether a vaccine could deliver protective immunity.Dr David Strain, Clinical Senior Lecturer, at the University of Exeter and chair of the British Medical Association’s Medical Academic Staff Committee, said: “This is a worrying finding for several reasons.“It suggests that previous infection is not protective and it raises the possibility that vaccinations may not provide the hope that we have been waiting for.”Vaccinations work by simulating infection in the body, which triggers the production of antibodies.Dr Strain added: “If antibodies don\u0027t provide lasting protection, we will need to revert to a strategy of viral near-elimination in order to return to a more normal life.”There has been growing speculation that people who contract the virus are not automatically immune from another infection. The common cold is also a coronavirus, but becoming infected does not stop reinfection in the near future. Although there have been previous reports of people picking up the virus again, it was unknown whether they had simply failed to clear it properly the first time round.However, some experts said that a rare case of re-infection with a different strain was to be expected given how widespread the virus is globally, and said it was too early to be alarmed.Brendan Wren, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, said: “With over 3 million cases of Covid-19 worldwide, the first reported case of a potential re-infection with coronavirus needs to be taken into context. “It appears that the young and healthy adult has been re-infected with a slight SARS-CoV-2 variant from the initial infection. “It is to be expected that the virus will naturally mutate over time. This is a very rare example of re-infection and it should not negate the global drive to develop Covid-19 vaccines.”Dr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, added: “The significant thing here is that being re-infected with a mutated strain demonstrates that it is more likely to be re-infection, rather than the same infection that has hung around because the virus has not actually been got rid of, as some people have suggested happens. “The finding of a mutant strain is absolutely nothing to be shocked or surprised by. It would actually be more interesting if there were no mutations cropping up.”The new paper has been accepted by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks national interest joe biden wins presidential race","story":"As the United States embarks on what might be its most acrimonious election in living memory, what outcome would be in the interests of the UK? A case can be made that the first term of President Trump has been not too bad from the British point of view. He is warm towards Britain, likes our Prime Minister and is in favour of a free trade deal. His administration has backed us up at some crucial moments, such as over the Salisbury poisonings, or China’s breach of its agreements with us over Hong Kong. He never looks happier abroad, or behaves with more decorum, than when visiting the Queen.These are actions we can appreciate, as are the tireless efforts of American diplomats to keep cooperation with allies on the road. Trump’s inability to keep a team together – with repeated changes of defence secretary, national security adviser and senior intelligence officials – has been damaging, but at lower levels the US system works closely with us every day, sharing valuable intelligence, keeping our militaries aligned and helping with law enforcement.Furthermore, it can be argued, many of Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements are part of a longer-term trend in US thinking. His attitude to China is symptomatic of Washington waking up to the rise of a new strategic adversary. The lectures to allies about paying their own way are an extension of appeals made by Obama, albeit more threatening. And his desire to bring troops home from Syria and Afghanistan is also part of a common American exhaustion after Iraq, even if more erratic and temperamental.So far, so much relief. Trump has not wrecked Nato or blown up the world. Yet we British have to recognise that something is fundamentally wrong. Something vital to us, as a medium-sized, transatlantic, democratic nation, is missing. We need the US to be the active leader of a network of alliances, of which we are a part, and to combine its great financial and physical strength with moral authority and respected global leadership. In the next four years, the need for that leadership will be as vital as it ever has been since the end of the Cold War. No other country can come close to providing it. And we have seen enough now to know that Donald Trump is not going to give it.The Covid-19 crisis has been, as in so many ways, a revelatory moment. Leave aside the chaotic domestic response in America – we have not been in a position to preach, and Europe’s problems are far from over. But the most striking aspect of the crisis has been the absence of any attempt at global leadership. The one person who could have moved other nations and his own to take it seriously, to coordinate policies, to consult on closing borders, share vaccine research, and act to prevent future pandemics, was the US president. The leader who could have summoned the G20, and even now could be ensuring sufficient support for developing countries to prevent a health and economic meltdown with far-reaching consequences, is in the White House.Next year, the UK will host the Cop26, the world conference on climate change. It will be the most crucial such meeting since Paris in 2015, and a decisive moment in seeking agreement from all countries to take necessary action. The Trump administration is uninterested in such issues and even hostile to addressing them. Within the US, it is pushing ahead with the obscenity of drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Internationally, it is unwilling to give the lead that would bring a global agreement within reach.Other issues of vast and lasting importance are coming to a head. Rivalry with China may well be unavoidable, but we need America to be at the centre of strong alliances as it faces up to that, not striking out on its own. Trump’s early decision to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership weakened his own country’s position on international trade, and the value to this country of ultimately joining the pact. More widely on China, Western countries are on the strongest ground when opposing totalitarian behaviour but still seeking a framework of coordination with Beijing on pressing global issues – arms control, climate change, and economic stability. Trump, however, often seems to have this the wrong way round: raising few objections to dictatorship while failing to find a constructive framework.One excruciating extract of the book by the most recently departed national security adviser, John Bolton, recounted how “Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do.” This is part of a pattern: he greeted Xi Jinping becoming president indefinitely with “I think it’s great”, said Kim Jong-Un had “a great and beautiful vision” for his country and has repeatedly raised inviting Putin to the G7, despite the deep discomfort of the leaders of other free nations.At a time when democracies, though resilient, are under the great strains of internal discontent and growing external interference, this disdain for the values of freedom and democracy is deeply damaging to the West. It is amplified by Trump’s unsubstantiated charges of fraudulent voting in his own country, intended to undermine confidence in any unwelcome result. \u2028It is in the vital interests of the UK that America, our indispensable ally, is ironclad and steadfast in its attachment to democracy at home and abroad: the capital and the arsenal of freedom.Last week, 73 former US national security officials who worked under the Reagan and Bush presidencies called on Republicans to forsake their party and vote for Joe Biden. Many British Conservatives, even those of us with decades-long friendships among Republicans, will feel the same. Biden will face his own problems, particularly of how to restrain the Left of his own party. But if he wins, which is by no means certain, he is committed to uphold human rights and democracy, persuade other countries to join the US in more ambitious environmental goals, and “restore a commitment to science and truth in government”. Such an approach would be good for the world and for America. And that means it would be good for Britain.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/06/16/fortnite.jpg","title":"fortnite apple epic games app store forza microsoft","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Xbox maker gives support to Epic Games\u0027 ongoing dispute with AppleOther games could suffer as a result of the fallout between Apple and the developer of Fortnite, Microsoft has said.The Xbox maker has thrown its backing behind Epic Games, which makes Fortnite, as it continues to publicly fight with Apple over its App Store rules.Apple and Epic have come into conflict because of rules that require any app or game sold through the App Store to pay a cut of its revenue to Apple, as part of the rules of its platform.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEpic has refused to follow that rule, adding a new payment system that allowed it to get around the App Store rules, and suing both Apple and Google.The dispute led not only to Fortnite being thrown out of the App Store, but a threat from Apple that Epic could be cut off from Apple\u0027s development tools entirely. That would cover not only Fortnite but also the variety of games that require Epic\u0027s software – not only its own titles, such as Fortnite, but a variety of third-party ones too.Apple issues rare apology in latest App Store controversyIn response to that threat, Epic began separate legal proceedings with the hope of securing an injunction that would stop Apple from carrying out on that threat.Now Xbox, part of Microsoft, has thrown its support behind Epic\u0027s request, filing a statement with a court in California that gave backing to the demand that it keeps access to its development tools.Epic losing access to Apple\u0027s development tools would impact other software beyond Fortnite, including its Unreal Engine gaming software, which is used by many other game developers, including Microsoft, to build their own products on.Today we filed a statement in support of Epic\u0027s request to keep access to the Apple SDK for its Unreal Engine, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in a tweet.Ensuring that Epic has access to the latest Apple technology is the right thing for gamer developers \u0026amp gamers.In the statement, filed to a US district court in California, Microsoft\u0027s general manager for gaming developer experiences, Kevin Gammill, said: Epic Games\u0027 Unreal Engine is critical technology for numerous game creators including Microsoft.He added that many other, smaller developers can not afford to build their own gaming engines, so are reliant on third-party software such as the Unreal Engine.As a result, Epic\u0027s Unreal Engine is one of the most popular third-party game engines available to game creators, and in Microsoft\u0027s view there are very few other options available for creators to license with as many features and as much functionality as Unreal Engine across multiple platforms, including iOS, Mr Gammill said.Denying Epic access to Apple\u0027s SDK and other development tools will prevent Epic from supporting Unreal Engine on iOS and macOS, and will place Unreal Engine and those game creators that have built, are building, and may build games on it at a substantial disadvantage.Because iOS is a large and growing market for games, Apple\u0027s discontinuation of Unreal Engine\u0027s ability to support iOS will be a material disadvantage for the Unreal Engine in future decisions by Microsoft and other game creators as to the choice of an engine for new games.Apple\u0027s discontinuation of Epic\u0027s ability to develop and support Unreal Engine for iOS or macOS will harm game creators and gamers.The dispute between Apple and Epic began when a payment option was added to Fortnite which allowed users to pay for in-game items directly through Epic.Both Apple and Google then removed Fortnite from their app stores, although mobile users on Google\u0027s Android can still download the app directly from Epic\u0027s website.The incident reignited debate around app store payment systems, which some developers have previously called unfair and anti-competitive.Apple has said Epic created the problem for itself but that it could easily be remedied if it updated Fortnite to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which apply to all developers.The App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users and a great business opportunity for all developers, the iPhone maker said.We won\u0027t make an exception for Epic because we don\u0027t think it\u0027s right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After examining data from 37 observational studies, Prof James found 32 of these studies reported that caffeine significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth, miscarriage and low birth weight.He also cited an increased risk of childhood acute leukaemia and children being overweight or obese when born to mothers who consume caffeine during pregnancy.The review found evidence for a link in five out of six negative pregnancy outcomes, excluding preterm birth.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have reported the world’s first case of a human being reinfected with the coronavirus in a discovery that could have significant implications for the development of vaccines, and hopes of natural immunity against the virus.Researchers at Hong Kong University’s department of microbiology said genetic sequencing of the virus showed that a Hong Kong man was infected twice by different versions of the coronavirus months apart.According to the study, the patient was a 33-year-old man who was in good health. When he was first infected, he suffered a cough, sore throat, fever and headache for three days. He had a test that confirmed Covid-19 and he was hospitalised on 29 March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe was discharged on 14 April after two negative swab tests.Four months later, he was returning to Hong Kong from Spain via the UK when he tested positive during entry screening at Hong King airport on 15 August. He was hospitalised again but had no symptoms throughout.Experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions based on a single case, but they acknowledged that the discovery was a concern.Announcing the results, the Hong Kong University researchers said: “An apparently young and healthy patient had a second episode of Covid-19 infection which was diagnosed 4.5 months after the first episode.“This case illustrates that reinfection can occur just after a few months of recovery from the first infection. Our findings suggest that Sars-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“Since the immunity can be short-lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection.“Patients with previous Covid-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing.”If the research, published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, is correct, then it could mean that vaccines against the virus do not give permanent protection and people will not be able to rely on being immune to the virus after recovering from an infection.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDr David Strain, from the University of Exeter, said: “This is a worrying finding for several reasons. The first, as is laid out in this manuscript, is that it suggests that previous infection is not protective. The second is that it raises the possibility that vaccinations may not provide the hope that we have been waiting for.“Vaccinations work by simulating infection to the body, thereby allowing the body to develop antibodies. If antibodies don’t provide lasting protection, we will need to revert to a strategy of viral near-elimination in order to return to a more normal life.”There have already been a number of reports of patients being reinfected with the virus, but these were based on clinical features of the disease. In this case, however, scientists used genetic sequencing to analyse the separate strains of the virus.Dr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, urged caution over the news, arguing that it was hard to draw conclusions until the full research study had been published.He said: “This is certainly stronger evidence of reinfection than some of the previous reports because it uses the genome sequence of the virus to separate the two infections. It seems much more likely that this patient has two distinct infections than a single infection followed by a relapse.“An important point about this one case, which is not mentioned in the press release, is that the second infection is asymptomatic. It was caught by screening tests on returning passengers at HK airport, and the inidual never developed any symptoms from their second infection.”He said that given the number of global infections so far, one case of reinfection was not surprising and he warned that the research “implications” were too broad given it was based on one case.“This may be very rare, and it may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious (though we don’t know whether this person was infectious during their second episode).”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “The significant thing here is that being reinfected with a mutated strain demonstrates that it is more likely to be reinfection, rather than the same infection that has hung around because the virus has not actually been got rid of, as some people have suggested happens.“The finding of a mutant strain is absolutely nothing to be shocked or surprised by.

The operator got the same results.“They told me that it is not just my region – some people in Newcastle are being directed to test centres in Scotland instead of ones in the city.“I have symptoms so am going to get them checked out.

However, there is a drive-through testing site at Bristol airport around 25 minutes away.Some people with a Southampton postcode are being directed to Swindon – around a four-hour round trip.Problems with the booking system have been highlighted from early on in the crisis but it appears that glitches in the system – which seem to disproportionately affect those on the coast – are yet to be rectified.Labour said it was “hugely disappointing” that the issues were still occurring and called on the government to address the issues as a “matter of urgency”.Shadow health minister Justin Madders said: “From the first days when testing centres were being rolled out, we have heard stories of people being sent unfeasibly long distances just to get a test, but for this to be still happening at this stage is hugely disappointing.“Quick and easy access to testing are cornerstones of an effective test and trace system but once again the Tories seem unable to get the basics right.“They must solve these problems as a matter of urgency.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “NHS Test and Trace is working, it’s completely free and is stopping the spread of coronavirus.“Regional testing slots are allocated based on the nearest testing site with availability and we are working to ensure this takes into account journey times.

The same way you have’The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Jerry Seinfeld has hit back at claims that New York City is “dead forever” as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.The comedian spoke out in an essay published on Monday by The New York Times.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAltucher’s essay argues that New York City is now “completely dead” and won’t bounce back from the business shutdowns and exoduses of people who moved away, perhaps permanently, during the pandemic.Seinfeld’s piece takes the opposite view, asserting instead that New York City will, in fact, bounce back, thanks to the “real, tough New Yorkers” who have stuck with the city.“The last thing we need in the thick of so many challenges is some putz on LinkedIn wailing and whimpering, ‘Everyone’s gone! I want 2019 back!’” the comedian wrote, adding: “Oh, shut up. Imagine being in a real war with this guy by your side.”The comedian goes on to argue that people will at some point go back to meeting in real life rather than remotely, because the latter provides “no energy”.“Real, live, inspiring human energy exists when we coagulate together in crazy places like New York City,” he adds.New York City is dead forever, according to people who know nothing“Feeling sorry for yourself because you can’t go to the theatre for a while is not the essential element of character that made New York the brilliant diamond of activity it will one day be again.”Seinfeld then predicts: “This stupid virus will give up eventually. The same way you have.”New York City will rise again, he argues, “because of all the real, tough New Yorkers who, unlike you, loved it and understood it, stayed and rebuilt it”.The titular sitcom Seinfeld was based in New York City. While most scenes were shot out of a studio in California, the show references multiple places around the city and encapsulates many aspects of its culture in the Nineties.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Filming has begun over the last few days, with the show starting tonight (24 August) in the US.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesITV’s head of digital channels and acquisitions Paul Mortimer said: “Las Vegas may seem like an odd destination for the show but the canny producers have beaten Covid with a show that adheres to all production protocols and that could well be sensational.”Love Island USA’s primetime spot on ITV2 marks a significant step up for the series, with the first season having occupied a late night spot on ITVBe when it aired in the UK last year.This suggests that ITV bosses hope Love Island USA will fill the spot left by its UK counterpart, which was cancelled this summer after the coronavirus pandemic made shooting “logistically impossible”.Love Island will also not return in January 2021, having aired its first winter series set in South Africa earlier in 2020.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Racism in the TV industry has caused a “lost generation” of black talent who quit after suffering discrimination, David Olusoga has said. The broadcaster and historian told the Edinburgh TV Festival his past experiences of depression and wanting to leave television were similar to those of “many black and brown people” in the industry. Delivering the keynote James MacTaggart lecture at the online event, Olusoga described himself as a “survivor”, rather than a “success story”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe added: “I am one of the last men standing of TV’s lost generation. “The generation of black and brown people who entered this industry 15, 20, 25 years ago with high hopes. National Guard to be deployed in Kenosha after Jacob Blake shootingMo Gilligan to present documentary about black British comediansBiden condemns ‘systemic racism’ in shooting of unarmed black manMichael Jackson criticised The Beatles in unearthed notes on racismWhy we desperately need a new strategy to tackle structural racism“I’m a survivor of a culture within TV that failed that generation. “I’m here because a handful of people used their power and their privilege to help me.” Olusoga said that during his early years in television “there were parts of the industry in which ersity meant making sure that there was a fair balance of people from Oxford and Cambridge”. He added that it is “lonely” as a black person in the television industry. “Being the only black person on a production means being the only person asking certain questions, the only person uncomfortable that an image or a sequence reinforces certain stereotypes,” he said. “Like other black people I know in this industry, I’ve spent my career complaining that scripts or rough cuts contain interviews with white experts, while all the black contributors are victims of the phenomena in question are speaking about their personal experiences – their feelings not their expertise.” Olusoga said he had been labelled as “difficult” during his career.

He said the Black Lives Matter movement had “forced our society to have conversations that for decades we have put off or avoided”. Olusoga received widespread praise for his speech, with MP David Lammy thanking him for an “exemplary, masterly and sobering” lecture.Actress Rebecca Front urged people to read a transcript of his “profound, powerful and personal” words, while BBC Radio 1xtra DJ Mistajam tweeted: “As someone who has worked in television and also as someone who works in radio and has done for 15 years, every single word resonated.”Additional reporting by Press Association Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Sofía Vergara has spoken out over a clip of a past appearance on Ellen DeGeneres’s show.The Modern Family star shared the video in question, in which DeGeneres pokes fun at Vergara’s pronunciation of specific ingredients she had to name as part of a cosmetics commercial.Vergara spoke out after several additional clips of DeGeneres making fun of her accent resurfaced on social media.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe actor described herself and DeGeneres as “two comedians having fun with each other to entertain”.“I was never a victim guys, I was always in on the joke,” she added.Why the tables have turned on Ellen DeGeneresIn the video she shared, which dates back to 2015, DeGeneres comments on an ad she and Vergara both starred in, for the cosmetics brand CoverGirl.“I don’t know why they give her the hardest lines, too – because we have to describe what’s in the CoverGirl make-up, and she has such a hard time pronouncing any of the ingredients,” DeGeneres says of Vergara.In turn, Vergara adds: “I think because you are much more famous than me... and older than me... so they give you priority and you read the script first and you’re the one that makes me say those words.”Despite Vergara’s statement, some still felt that the segment didn’t sit well with them.“You are strong and confident enough to not be a victim, however I think laughing and mocking other people’s accents without even speaking a second language is quite ignorant, and not necessarily hilarious for our Latino community,” one person wrote.The clips of Vergara’s past appearances on DeGeneres’s show resurfaced after the programme became the subject of an internal investigation into allegations that it was a toxic work environment. Three senior producers have stepped down amid the probe, according to Variety.DeGeneres, who according to NBC News wasn’t personally a part of the review,  has said she is “disappointed” and “sorry” about staffers’ alleged conduct.The Independent has contacted DeGeneres’s team for comment.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But former Brexit Secretary David Davis has warned it is a critical endgame and the UK will soon have to be preparing for talks to collapse.He said Brussels will try to take things to the wire, adding: “The last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.” One Eurocrat admitted “outsiders don’t realise how pessimistic we’ve become” about getting a trade deal.The UK is holding firm on a refusal to accept EU red tape or cave in on fishing rights. Mr Barnier fears talks are headed for a bitter breakdown.He believes Downing Street is laying the ground for a vicious “blame game” over who is responsible for the stalemate.In a gloomy briefing to diplomats, the grumpy Frenchman claimed that last week’s tetchy round of talks have made things worse.The UK’s negotiator David Frost had put forward a draft text last week in the hope of speeding up the discussions. But Mr Barnier dismissed it as “unrealistic” and urged EU states to stay “cold blooded”.He insisted that the UK’s “clear strategy” will be to “trade off” fishing access for freedom from EU rules at the last minute.An EU source said: “We expect the mood to switch rapidly to contingency planning in expectation the UK will throw itself into the blame game rather than the endgame.”A British official hit back, saying: “The UK has consistently pushed for detailed textual discussions on the core elements of a trade agreement.“If the EU continues to stall progress because of its unrealistic asks on fish and subsidies, we will quickly run out of time.”WELL now I’ve seen everything. The gullible British Remainer Press report breathlessly that Michel Barnier is telling usthe Brexit negotiations are “running out of time”.Barnier is desperate to resolve his red line issues before we get to the critical endgame. I’ve always said the last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.But there will come a time very shortly when we will have to sht the thrust of our preparations towards No Deal. The reason for this is that the European Union always runs out the clock.When it is bullying some smaller state this works to its advantage. In the Brexit negotiation what will happen in the last few weeks is that the nation states of Europe will have to come to terms with the size of the risks that Barnier is taking.If we end up with a no deal scenario — and it is possible — the Europeans stand to lose a large and very profitable marketplace, namely the UK.It is clear that there are only two options now for leaving at the end of the transition period, a no deal exit or a zero-tarf deal. All sensible business owners will be preparing for both.Deferral and delay is the only thing that affects certainty. Certainty is what business and the country as a whole require.We already know there has been no “Great British Exodus” nor immediate recession — despite what certain pundits predicted.As long as we leave on time, there is no reason why this should change.Indeed,we deliver the certainty of the end of the transition period, there is every reason business and the economy will bounce back.It is incredible after all this time to see Brussels still bent on ensuring that Britain somehow loses out, so fixated are they on deterring others from ­abandoning their club.They are still making patently unreasonable power grabs even their europhile fans struggle to defend. They still want newly-independent Britain to surrender full control of our fishing waters. To agree economic restrictions to prevent us undercutting them and keep us under their thumb.They simply must change the recordthey’re genuinely worried about the potential hardship of us trading on WTO terms — and them copping the blame. No objective person will fault Britain for sticking to its guns on principles so fundamental.Michel Barnier won’t get his way. He and those pulling his strings seem strangely unable to digest that the Theresa May regime is gone, that voters threw out the Remainer Parliament and installed committed Brexiteers instead.We do agree with Barnier that negotiations seem dead in the water and a “no deal” looks nailed on.

Therefore, where possible, teachers need to show leniency. Social distancing rules also mean the idea of putting a child and teacher on their own for an hour in detention after school is a non-starter.“It is one change pupils will be cheering about — but it may leave teachers pulling their hair out.”Schools in England are under strict orders to put secondary school years into “bubbles” and not allow them to mingle with each other to reduce any risk of the spread of the virus.But ministers are taking a tougher tone with parents. They insisted school will again be “compulsory” from next week — and parents who refuse to send kids back face £ fines.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “In terms of fining, we would ask all schools to work with those parents to encourage them to bring their children back and deal with any concerns they may have.“Fining would be very much the last resort — as it has always been.”He also said schools would be placed in local lockdown again only as a final course of action.  Normal sanctions must apply once schools go back, as even Labour agrees they must.

The report, aposPoverty in the Pandemic: The impact of coronavirus on low-income families and childrenapos, is based on a survey of  hard-up households with kids eligible for free school meals, and  in-depth interviews. About eight of out  of those questioned admitted they were in a worse financial position than before the Covid- outbreak struck in March. Half were much worse off because their income plunged while costs climbed. Desperate parents told how they planned to sell jewellery so they could afford to let their kids carry on watching TV during the nationwide lockdown. Others admitted crying at night because they were mired in poverty while the country was shutdown. Nearly nine in  of those quizzed were spending substantially more than before on food, electricity, and other essentials because were stuck at home much more. Some % said the crisis hampered their ability to pay for food, % said it hit their ability to pay utility bills and % their ability to afford housing costs. Some % said it hampered their ability to pay for child-related costs such as nappies, baby products and children’s clothes. Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “Low-income parents have been living under a cloud of anxiety in lockdown, trying to find money for family basics as their costs have been rising. “That’s taken a very heavy toll on the health and wellbeing of the worst-affected parents and children.” The majority of those questioned cited problems with the welfare system.They included benefit levels being too low to cover basic living costs, especially for those who had previously been working the long waiting period and additional delays in receiving the first Universal Credit payment, coupled with uncertainty in amounts received the impact of the benefit cap on families who had been furloughed at less than their full pay and dficulty in knowing where to look for advice on claiming benefits and other support.About two-thirds had been working before the pandemic or had a partner who had been working. Most of that group had either lost their job or seen a signicant drop in their earnings or income from self-employment, including furloughed workers on less than full pay. Experts fear rising levels of poverty as the Treasury begins to wind down the furlough scheme from next month. The authors of todayaposs -page report called on the Government to raise child benefit by £ a week and add an extra £ a week to the child element within Universal Credit and child tax credits, extend free school meals to all families who receive UC or Working Tax Credit, and scrap the benefit cap – or at least suspend it during the pandemic. Ms Garnham added: “As the Government’s Covid- emergency support schemes are tapered away in the coming months, more help will be needed for struggling families who have lost jobs or taken income drops. “Otherwise they will have only more hardship on their horizon.” At the height of the lockdown in April, demand for foodbank parcels rocketed. Centres in the Independent Food Aid Network reported a % increase in demand, while the UKaposs biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, reported an % rise. The Trussell Trustaposs director of policy and research Garry Lemon said last night: “We’ve seen more families needing help from foodbanks as the impact of coronavirus continues to hit people’s incomes. “This isn’t right. “The Government must ensure support is in place so people aren’t locked into poverty this winter, especially as projects like the furlough scheme are set to wind down in the coming months. “The rising need for foodbanks is not inevitable this can change.” Away from the financial impact inflicted by the pandemic, households also revealed added stress fuelled by the crisis. Nearly a quarter – % – experienced “relationship issues at home”, % suffered physical or mental health problems, and % took on extra caring responsibilities Bishop of Durham Paul Butler said: “In these unprecedented times, we all need to ask ourselves urgently how we can help our neighbour. “It is also imperative that the Government does all that it can to protect families and children by implementing the practical recommendations in this report. “We all must play our part.

The investigation came after Dame Margaret was said to have shouted at Mr Corbyn in a corridor, accusing him of racism and being antisemitic. A new book by journalists Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire claims the relationship fell apart because Mr McDonnell felt it was wrong to hold the probe.  The book says: “A question that preoccupied aides was whether McDonnell and Corbyn were comrades or personal friends first. “For a period that summer it was clear they were neither.” It said McDonnell “exploded” over the  investigation into Dame Margaret, a party member for more than  years. The book claims: “One senior aide said, ‘They never spoke for months. Never spoke the whole summer.’ The leader refused to contact the man to whom he had once been a lone friend in politics. By the end of the summer, neither was answering the other’s calls.”  The book quotes another Labour staffer saying: “They were walking past each other in the corridor and blanking each other – it was that level of not talking.” The book, serialised in The Times, says Mr Corbyn’s senior policy adviser Andrew Fisher was sent to Norfolk, where the Shadow Chancellor was on holiday on the Broads, to negotiate a settlement. It adds: “After a call with Corbyn and his aides, McDonnell agreed to bury the hatchet.” The book, ‘Left Out: The Inside Story of Labour Under Corbyn’, adds: “A question that troubled some was whether Corbyn categorised antisemitism as the kind of racism he set himself against.” "},{"url":null,"title":"schools covid 19 safe scientists","story":"NewsAre schools Covid- safe  Scientists advice explained as Boris Johnson demands The Prime Minister says theres a moral duty to send children back to school - but does re-opening classrooms pose a risk to students, teachers and family members  Heres what experts thinkShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsBoris Johnson wants all children back in school next month \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And ministers have warned parents they risk a finethey refuse to send their children back to school, as a last resort.But with the coronavirus still present and being transmitted in communities, is it safe for children toto schools Hereaposs a look at the safety and logistics of schools reopening. What have the experts said  The UKaposs chief medical officers have warned children are more at risk of long-term harmthey do not attend school thanthey . In a joint statement, the advisers said children have an exceptionally low risk of dying from the disease and very few,any children and teenagers would come to long-term harm from the virus solely by attending school.Should parents be fined for not sending their kids back to school  Tell us in the comments below And what is the latest scientic evidence   A study by Public Health England , published on Sunday, found there were  single confirmed cases, four co-primary casesand  outbreaks of Covid- in schools during June. It said the majority of cases linked to outbreaks were in staff, transmission between students was very rare, and where children did contract the virus, they were more likely to catch it at home, usually from a parent. Is there a risk to clinically extremely vulnerable pupils or parents  As the shielding programme for children and adults was paused on August , guidance says that pupils in this group canto school, as can those who have family members who are shielding. But,a local area sees a spike of Covid-, children or family members who live there will be advised to shield while rates remain high, and so may be temporarily absent from school. What about the risk of children coming home from school and infecting parents or grandparents   The Chief Medical Officers say international evidence suggests transmission from school-age children to parents or family members is rare. But they admit this evidence is weak. Teenagers, they say, may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children. And they say that because schools connect households, itaposs likely reopening them will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely. But the Chiefs say this is as much to do with aposindirectapos linking as it is a direct result of opening schools. That means some of the bump in transmission is likely to be from parents being able toto workplaces because schools are open, and from parents meeting up at the school gates. What measures are schools putting in place  The Government has set out a series of measures that all schools must follow, including good respiratory hygiene and enhanced cleaning procedures, such as hand sanitiser stations in classrooms. More regular hand-washing is advised and staff should ensure that children do so when they arrive at school,from their break, change rooms and after eating. Those who have symptoms of Covid-, or are in a household with someone displaying symptoms, should be kept away from the school. How dferent will the school day look for pupils  Staggering break and lunch times should be looked at and, ensuring that teaching time is maintained, schools should consider staggered start and finish times to keep groups apart as they arrive and leave school. When timetabling lessons, schools should ensure that dferent groups, or bubbles, are kept apart and movement around the school should be kept to a minimum. What are school bubbles and how will they work   As a way of minimising contact between students, and so reducing transmission of the disease, guidance recommends keeping groups of children separate in bubbles. Guidance suggests that in secondary schools the bubble is likely to be the size of a year group to enable staff to deliver the full range of curriculum subjects, while smaller group sizes may be implemented with younger children. Groups should be kept apart where possible, and older pupils should be encouraged to keep their distance from other children and teachers within the same group. But how will the groups be maintained  A headteachersapos union has warned that it will be enormously challenging for schools to keep children apart in year-group-sized bubbles. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: The logistics of keeping apart many dferent aposbubblesapos of children in a full school, including whole year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind-boggling. Whatsomeone becomes unwell at school  If a pupil or a member of staff has symptoms of the virus, they should stay at home and arrange a test. In the case of a positive test, everyone within the school that had been in close contact with the pupil or staff member will be asked to self-isolate. A school will be said to have an outbreakthere are two or more confirmed cases within  days or an overall rise in absence where Covid- is suspected.

It was slow to provide protective kit, slow to protect care homes and slow to start testing. Even when they had the chance to learn from other countries, such as with the exams crisis, ministers have been caught on the hop. The shambolic efforts to reopen schools in England next month are a perfect example of mistakes not being learned from but repeated. The Government has had months to prepare for the new term, yet headteachers and parents cry out for clear guidance and support. Schools want to know what happensthere is a second spike. They want clarity on whether face coverings should be worn and how staff should interact with pupils. They also need help to pay for extra cleaning and equipment. It is not good enough for Boris Johnson to shout from the sidelines. We need him on the pitch addressing the real concerns of parents, pupils and teachers. Aid the needy  Even before the virus hit, far too many households struggled to make ends meet. Their plight has been made even worse as a result of the lockdown. An important study by the Child Poverty Group and the Church of England shows Britain’s poorest families have been left without the money to pay for food and utility bills. They are backing the Mirror’s call for an immediate increase in child benefit and the scrapping of the benefit cap. The Government has a warped sense of priorities when it is subsiding the wealthy to eat out but doing nothing to help the poorest.

He told Sky: “We need to make clear that we are not looking here for a massive change. We are looking for very, very tight reform.  “I think that given the very limited nature of these proposals, that it would be for someone who is within six months of the end of their le, with very strong safeguards, the decision being made by a High Court judge, by two doctors – I think those limited proposals may command the support of Parliament in the next four years.” Mr Mitchellaposs proposals are one backed by campaigning group Dignity in Dying, which also calls for assisted dying to be rolled out in a limited manner. On the groups website it says: Dying people are not suicidal – they don’t want to die but they do not have the choice to live. When death is inevitable, suffering should not be. Along with good care, dying people deserve the choice to control the timing and manner of their death.  The topic was brought into Parliament in  when a bill calling for some terminally ill adults to have the choice to opt for euthanasia was tabled. In a free vote in the Commons,  MPs were in favour and  against the plans. Under those proposals people with fewer than six months to live could have been prescribed a lethal dose of drugs, which they had to be able to take themselves. Two doctors and a High Court judge would have needed to approve each case. At the time of the vote Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, explained why he was happy that it was rejected. He told the BBC: It protects those who have no voice against exploitation and coercion, it acts as a powerful deterrent to would-be abusers and does not need changing.  Mr Mitchell moved to soothe fears that assisted dying legislation would lead rogue actors to end otheraposs lives against their will. He said: “People who fear the thin end of the wedge, slippery slope argument can be reassured and they can be reassured on this count: that once Parliament passes a very limited law, they would have to go back to Parliament to get that law changed. In the past people calling for the right to end their lives with the help of a medical professional have taken their cause as far as the High Court.The most recent was Phil Newby, from Rutland in East Midlands, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at just -years-old, the Daily Star reported."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus live boris schools uk","story":"NewsCoronavirus UPDATES: Usain Bolt in quarantine after partying with Raheem SterlingThe m mens world record holder was tested for the coronavirus on Sunday, two days after he celebrated his th birthday along with pals including Raheem Sterling in JamaicaShareByMilo BoydUpdated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror sport other-sports athletics video usain-bolt-confirms-quarantine-following-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Researchers made the discovery by injecting saline with tiny microbubbles into the veins of  critically ill Covid- patients and tracked the bubbles using ultrasound. Normally, the bubbles would travel through the heart and enter the lungs, but would not get through the lungs because they would not fit through the capillaries. In more than % of these patients, however, the bubbles passed through the lungs and reached the blood vessels of the brain, which means the lung#xs capillaries were abnormally dilated, researchers reported earlier this month in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. The more bubbles that made their way beyond patients#x lungs, the lower their oxygen levels, researchers said.This #xCmay explain the disproportionate low oxygen levels seen in many patients with Covid- pneumonia,#xD coauthor Dr. Hooman Poor of the Mount Sinai - National Jewish Health Respiratory Institute in New York City told Reuters.It is possible the higher than normal amount of blood flowing to the brain could be linked to neurological conditions associated with the coronavirus, such as tiredness.

The brekkie-on-wheels service will be tested when childrento school in England next week in a bid to keep them in their class bubbles. According to a Kellogg’s survey of teachers, making sure children don’t start the school day on an empty tummy is one of the biggest challenges of the school day in the socially distanced new normal. Teachers say that serving breakfast at desks is the best solution as opting for staggered start times will mean making the meal available from -am which is unworkable. The trollies from Kellogg’s are part of a pilot scheme in around  schools and the food wagons will be loaded with hot and cold grub like toast, cereal and fruit as well as goodies from breakfast club partner Greggs. They will trundle along corridors and stop at classrooms to dish out food from .am so parents can drop the kids and go to work.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereGrab bags will also be tested in a separate scheme as teachers say parents are already askingbreakfast clubs will be available when the new school year starts. Kate Prince, corporate social responsibility manager at Kellogg’s said: “Trollies have been adapted to include a hot plate so children have the option of a hot or cold breakfast andit’s successful then we may extend the scheme to other schools. “We’re also looking at breakfast bags with fruit, cereal boxes and cereal bars which can be distributed easily.” School breakfast clubs are a big concern with almost nine in  teachers believingthey are axed it will have an adverse impact on children. The survey of  teachers found two thirds felt breakfast clubs will be needed more than ever as kids head back for the first time since lockdown.  One teacher said: “Some children will not have any breakfast at all meaning they will be hungry all day until lunchtime. “This will cause loss of concentration and behavioural issues.” Another added: “Some children need our breakfast club to get them started and in the right mind-set for learning.” Kellogg’s set up its breakfast club programme in  and to date has donated £ million in grants to schools to help provide morning meals for kids. Another survey of  teachers by charity Magic Breakfast which also provides food for schools, found almost six in  teachers felt there would be more kids arriving hungry for lessons this term compared with September last year.

The fast food chain axed its -year-old catchphrase amid concerns it “doesn’t quite fit in the current environment”. It has released images of new advertising posters with the two world famous key words blurred out leaving just “it’s good” visible. KFC said it was a temporary suspension as the message did not suit the hygiene message in the new normal. But bosses vowed the phrase would make a comeback “when the time is right”. KFC admitted it had set itself a major headache trying to find a substitute slogan more than six decades after “it’s finger lickin’ good” was enough to identy its fried chicken pieces. Kate Wall, head of advertising at KFC UK said: “People often say that it’s the second movie that’s hardest to get right. The follow-up, the next step. And we are facing the same conundrum at the moment. “How do you follow a slogan that’s lasted for  years and is as iconic as ours  “Well, we know we can do it with a little help from our friends. And you’ll be hearing more from us on this soon.” Unveiling the new look ads with “finger” and “lickin’” pixelated in a YouTube video, KFC told viewers: “That thing we all say  Ignore it. For now.” Catherine Tan-Gillespie, global chief marketing officer at KFC said: “We find ourselves in a unique situation - having an iconic slogan that doesn’t quite fit in the current environment.  “While we are pausing the use of ‘It’s Finger Lickin’ Good’, rest assured the food craved by so many people around the world isn’t changing one bit.” The fast food chain which has more than  restaurants across the UK and Ireland and employs , staff recently fell foul of public opinion after its “finger lickin’ good” ads in late February showed diners greedily licking their hands after a meal.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

On August  elaborate celebrations will be held to mark the anniversary of Kim Jong-il founding of Songun. Songun is a political ideological unique to North Korea that claims all problems in society can be corrected by giving priority to military affairs Ahead of the event the North Korean government released a film containing images of current leader Kim, his birth mother Ko Yong-hui and his we Ri Sul-ju.The  minute video shows Ko Yong-hui in Osandeok City in the North Hamgyeong Province - the hometown of Kim Jong-il, Daily NK reported.The film later shows Kim as a child, reading, making art and planting trees together with his mum. In North Korea Kimaposs mother is only referred to by titles, such as The Respected Mother who is the Most Faithful and Loyal aposSubjectapos to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander. The circumstances surround her death are unclear.On  August , ious sources reported that she had died in Paris from unspecic illness, probably of breast cancer.Other reports claims that she was treated in Paris in the spring of  and then flown back to Pyongyang where she fell into a coma and died in August that year.The previous regime attempted to build a cult of personality around Ko prior to Kimaposs ascent to power.Such moves have been frustrated by her lowly origins, as considered by North Koreaaposs songbun class system. Not only did Koaposs Korean-Japanese heritage make her part of the lowest hostile class, her fatheraposs work in a Japanese army sewing factory rendered her the low of the low in North Korean eyes. Kim is said to be fearful that public knowledge of details of his motheraposs upbringing would undermine his familyaposs pure bloodline. As a consequence Koaposs name became an official state secret after Kim Jong-il died in . She is now referred to by her nicknames. It was reported earlier today that rumours about Kimaposs health are circulating again.  Whispers that he could be dead started again after a South Korean diplomat sensationally claimed the North Korean leader is in a coma. Chang Song-min, a former aide to South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung, didnapost provide any evidence to back up his claim - the same one he made months ago only for Kim to be pictured in public days later.

The Queen and Prince Philip will spend the next few months at their ,-acre Scottish estate and their relatives and in-laws will come and stay at dferent points.According to her granddaughter Princess Eugenie, the stunning castle is where the Monarch is the most happy, and she loves spending time with her children and their familes. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their kids George, Charlotte and Louis, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and the York sisters all pop in to stay with the Queen and Philip during their holidays - making it a very busy time for them.But what exactly do the royals get up to during their Scottish break  Due to social distancing, relatives will stay at separate accommodation rather than sleeping in the Castle itself. However the majority of their normal holiday activities take place outdoors anyway, so they wonapost have to make many changes to ensure everyone is safe. Speaking on ITVaposs documentary Our Queen at , Eugenie, who was spotted arriving at the Castle last week, talked about previous trips to Balmoral.  She said: Itaposs the most beautul place on earth. I think Granny is the most happy there, I think she really, really loves the Highlands…walks, picnics, dogs, a lot of dogs, thereaposs always dogs, and people coming in and out all the time. Family-wise weaposre all there, so itaposs a lovely base for Granny and Grandpa to be - for us to come and see them up there where you just have room to breathe and run. But according to an insider, itaposs not almost the most relaxing break and things can be pretty hectic.  They told Vanity Fair: “It can get quite busy at what they call ‘the big house’ and it’s not especially relaxing even though it’s a holiday. “There’s a daily routine which evolves around meal times, several outfit changes every day, sometimes five, and the Queen likes everything to run like clockwork. The focus is on being outdoors and in the countryside walking, grousing, fishing and hunting.” Balmoral is a working estate with highlights including grouse moors, the lush green forests and farmland, as well as plenty of animals from the herds of deer to Highland cattle and ponies.  The Royals love grouse hunting, and go out regularly during their time at the castle. Prince Charles, William, Harry and Kate have all been known to go out shooting over the summer months, and last year they even took little George along to watch.However, they were forced to call off the whole grouse shooting season last year as there was a drop in the number of the birds in the area due to insects and bad  weather. Photographer Milton Gendel said he was invited to Balmoral back in  , and opened up about the experience to  Vanity Fair  .He wrote: On some days there were excursions into the country. The Queen had been taught to drive by auxiliary army officers during World War II, and she handled a Land Rover with intrepid skill on the hilly and winding roads. When we went riding, she saddled her horse, and afterward carried the saddle back to the stable herself.  At a shoot on the grounds a truck delivered a sumptuous buffet lunch. The aposgunsapos lay on the grass for a postprandial respite. The Queen and her sister walked about, deep in conversation. They were very close when apart, they telephoned two or three times a day. The atmosphere was always agreeable, buoyed by the light touch of the Queen and her sister.

But these widely prescribed drugs can come with a hidden cost. They are just a few of the le-saving and le-changing medicines which can disrupt nutrient absorption. And the more of them you take – and the longer you take them — the greater the risk of developing potentially dangerous nutrient deficiencies. Michael Wakeman, a pharmacist and specialist in nutritional medicine, was alerted to the danger after spotting a scientic paper which was aptly titled: “Effects of widely used drugs on micronutrients: a story rarely told.” It led to five years of research, trawling medical journals and scientic papers, which he says “was like peeling an onion. The more you dig and the more layers you peel away, the more problems you discover. “Some of the links – such as metformin and vitamin B – are quite well-known, but the more you look, the more you find.” NHS dietitian Catherine Collins says: “Medications impact nutrient status in a number of ways. They reduce uptake by binding with the nutrient, or a co-factor needed for absorption there can be issues with increased clearance and there can be metabolic changes influencing absorption.” In many cases, the impacts are quite subtle, so they are not listed as potential side effects. But taking several medicines, each with a small effect, can easily add up to a serious deficiency. Problems are compounded by the fact that the number of medicines we take tends to increase as we get older, when our bodies are less efficient at absorbing nutrients. Dietary gaps and bad habits, such as smoking and drinking alcohol, add to the risk of shortfalls. Catherine Collins says not to take nutrients in large doses, unless it is on medical advice, but adds: “A generic vitamin and mineral supplement can be useful to mop up micronutrient deficiencies.” Just  medicines account for almost a third of prescriptions dispensed each year and Mr Wakeman says four out of five of them have some impact on nutrient status. Metformin impairs uptake of vitamin B, and this is flagged up as a “very rarely reported” side effect on information ­leaflets. However, one study warned as many as % of diabetics taking metformin for three or more years develop problems. Eating a vegan or vegetarian diet and older age, also increase the risk of being low in vitamin B. Shortfalls can cause muscle weakness and nerve damage, which is also a common complication of diabetes. Mr Wakeman suspects some cases of deficiency are being misdiagnosed as diabetic neuropathy. Metformin also reduces levels of folate, thiamine, magnesium and vitamin D — which is important for immunity. Mr Wakeman says: “The last thing I want to do is scare anyone into stopping taking metformin, but it is important people are aware of the issue and, in my opinion, it would make sense to take a multivitamin with a higher level of vitamin B.” Emma Elvin, senior clinical adviser at Diabetes UK, says: “It could be dficult to identy the exact cause of any nerve ­problems in people with diabetes, ­especiallythey have a B deficiency too. The most important thing is that it is identied and treated appropriately.” Proton pump inhibitors such as ­omeprazole, lansoprazole and other drugs ending in “azole” are often taken alongside metformin and medicines for high blood pressure and heart problems. They are also sold over the counter as Nexiumor Guardium. These PPIs reduce stomach acid, which disrupts absorption of a range of nutrients including vitamin B,vitamin C, betacarotene, iron, folic acid, magnesium and calcium. Several studies have reported low magnesium levels in patients taking PPIs for a year or more.Magnesium is found in a range of foods including green vegetables, nuts and wholegrains, but the National Diet and Nutrition Survey found that % of working-age adults and % of over-s have low levels. Signs of a deficiency include tiredness, cramps, nausea and abnormal heart rhythms. Diuretics such as bumetanide, furosemide and metolazone alter the way the kidneys work and this can accelerate excretion of potassium, magnesium, thiamine, vitamin C and folic acid. Loss of potassium is the most common problem, and patients are often advised to take a supplement. Signs of a shortfall include fatigue, weakness, muscle cramps and constipation. Potassium-rich foods include bananas, spinach and avocados. Ace-inhibitors – which usually end in “pril”, such as ramipril, captopril and ­enalapril – are associated with low levels of vitamin D. We make vitamin D, which is important for immunity, from sunshine and shortfalls are common. The Chief Medical Officers suggest everyone takes a mcg supplement of vitamin D in winter. Millions of Britons take statins to reduce their risk of heart disease. However, these cholesterol-lowering drugs also reduce absorption of coenzyme Q, which cells need for growth and repair. The impact of statins on vitamin D ies, but there is evidence that people with already low levels are at increased risk of muscle pain – a known side-effect of these drugs.

The arrival of the second unseasonable storm in less than a week was heralded by heavy rainfall hitting the south-west coast of England overnight. Holidaymakers, including those camping along the south coast, have been warned to expect an unseasonably wet and windy spell as the storm travels east. It comes after similar rough weather hit the UK last week with tragic consequences. Storm Ellen caused -year-old Nicola Williams to be swept to her death in the Rhymney River in Llanrumney, Cardf, while a -year-old holidaymaker died in the sea near Helston in west Cornwall. Ellen also caused flooding, travel chaos and thousands of power outages across the UK. A yellow weather warning is in place for all of Wales and most of England, while there are heavy rain warnings in place for southern Scotland, north Wales and northern England, which are expected to stay in place until Wednesday. Nicola Maxey of the Met Office said: Since  when we started naming storms, we have never had to name a storm in August - and now weaposve had two in a few days. There are a lot of people on holiday in the UK at the moment, going camping and on walking breaks, many in coastal locations where the winds are likely to be stronger, so it is worth checking on the Met Office website ahead of time.  The rain is expected to be heaviest in Northern Ireland and south-west Scotland where up to three-and-a-half inches in total could fall as the storm moves from west to east. Storm Francis is expected to clear by Wednesday lunchtime, leaving a brighter and more settled outlook for the remainder of the day, the Met Office said. It added that the bank holiday weekend would likely be a mixture of sunshine and some scattered showers across the country. Forecasters said the winds were unusual for August, but would have to go some way to beat the current record wind gust speed of mph recorded at The Needles on the Isle of Wight in August .  Likewise, the wettest August on record in the UK was in  when . mm was recorded across the country as a whole. Between August  and , the UK as a whole had seen some .mm of rainfall - around four-fths of the average rainfall for the month. No new storm is currently forecast this month, meaning the next storm will begin with A rather than G, as the storm-naming calendar resets on September .  UK  day weather forecast Today: A wet and windy start for most and then a very windy day, especially the southern half of the UK. Drier and brighter weather developing over southern and eastern England this afternoon but further north many staying wet all day. Tonight: Further spells of rain affecting much the UK this evening and overnight. Drier across southern UK and the far north of Scotland. Staying windy, especially during the evening.

She describes herself as a Plain Jane and says she was a geek, but in the years since sheaposs undergone a complete transformation, both mentally and physically, and is much happier for it. In fact, Roxy is now so dferent that she claims many of her old classmates donapost recognise her when she runs into them in her home city Cardf. At , sheaposs now a bikini model and has recently retrained as a personal trainer, and is proud of the outgoing adult sheaposs become. She said: “You wouldn’t recognise me physically and mentallyyou knew me when I was at school - a lot of people don’t. “I was really skinny growing up - my legs were just as thick as my arms. Now I’ve got an athletic figure and I’m a completely dferent person. I was painfully shy as a child. I was a geek and academic and didn’t get into trouble. “I had a bit of acne and never wore makeup because my dad didn’t like it - so I wasn’t really able to explore it. I was a bit of a plain Jane.  “Things changed when I went to sixth form and I was put with people I didn’t know. I was forced to talk and thrown in the deep end. “When I was  I bought a self-help book and that really started to build my confidence. “That and more le experience have made me a dferent person. It has been a gradual process but wearing makeup and glamming myself did help.  “If you feel confident on the inside, you feel confident on the outside. After finishing school Roxy studied health nutrition at university and got a number of office jobs. But her confidence started to grow when she began lting weights about four years ago and saw how her body was changing. Teaching herself with YouTube videos and books she quickly turned her skinny physique into a sleek athletic one which motivated her further to start wearing makeup and doing her hair. She went on to enter bikini competitions before qualying as a personal trainer three years ago - something she initially did part-time. But since being furloughed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Roxy has now dedicated all of her time to her passion and is hoping to turn it into a full-time career.This involves her confidently speaking to strangers - something she’d never have done as a teenager. And the transformation has given her a more lucrative career, as well as a new lease of le.  She said: “I make more money per hour doing personal training. My office job was £ an hour but personal training is around £ an hour so there’s potential to make a lot more money. “Before lockdown I was working  hours a week. I worked from .am until pm so I could only train people before or after work or on the weekend.

Paying up a the end off your weekly shop becomes a personal challenge to try and bag the items as quickly as the cashier is scanning them - and itaposs one youaposre likely to lose. With a queue of keen spectators looking on, many shoppers crack under the pressure - but one mum has revealed she simply doesnapost give them the chance.  Aldi customers have previously shared hilarious hacks to slow down the checkout staff, including one who advised scrunching up the packaging around the barcode so it wouldnapost scan first time. Others said they preferred to work in teams, with one slowly handing the items over one at a time at the till while the other packs. But sometimesyou donapost ask, you donapost get - and thataposs exactly what one mum said she does in a discussion on the Aldi Mums Facebook page. You can ask them to slow down, I do, she said. They don’t mind. And never had a rude checkout operator either.  And it turns out plenty of others have been doing the same, as another said: I always ask the checkout workers at my local ALDI to slow down a bit, so I don’t get overwhelmed. They always say yes and it’s always very pleasant, never had a problem. But for others the sheer panic of racing to pack was all part of the Aldi experience, as reported by Kidspot. One argued: Keeping up with the ALDI checkout workers is a game for me. It should be an Olympic sport.

According to a tracker by John Hopkins University, there have been ,, Covid- cases globally and the killer virus has claimed , lives to date. More than  million people have recovered. But there are  nations where their government claim they have managed to remain coronavirus-free. Some authorities are unlikely to admitthey have an outbreak while countries that are remote islands are able to evade the virus by refusing to let outsiders in, the Business Insider reports. The Cook Islands The South Pacic island is self-ruling but is in free association with New Zealand so closed its borders to the country when it saw a spike in cases. Last week week its former prime minister Joseph Williams was hospitalised with coronavirus but he is in New Zealand Prime Minister Henry Puna said: We are taking very serious measures in order to protect our people and to control and keep this deadly disease away from our shores.

It lies between Tonga and the Cook Islands.  North Korea The countryaposs dictator Kim Jong-un has denied any confirmed cases but has repeatedly warned the virus is a threat. It already has little contact and travel with the rest of the world but it closed it borders further in January, and recently quarantined a border town after a defector entered from South Korea. Experts are sceptical about its claims of no cases and believe the country may have had an outbreak in March or even earlier.  Palau The Pacic Ocean country is an archipelago of more than  islands and around , people. Its health ministry has issued guidelines on how citizens can protect themselves from contracting the virus and all travellers must quarantine on entry.

The island, which gained independence the Soviet Union in , already claims it has no citizens with HIV Aids, which experts say is not possible. But Turkmenistan is already one of the hardest countries in the world to enter and at the beginning of the outbreak it made things tougher which may have helped it avoid any cases.

The scientists say the case illustrates that reinfection can occur a few months after recovery from the first infection. The findings indicate the disease, which has killed more than , people worldwide, will continue to spread among the global population despite herd immunity, they said. The -year-old male was cleared of Covid- and discharged from a hospital in April, but tested positive again after ing from Spain via the UK on August . The patient had appeared to be previously healthy, researchers said in the paper, which was accepted by the international medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. He was found to have contracted a dferent coronavirus strain from the one he had previously contracted and remained asymptomatic for the second infection. The finding does not mean taking vaccines will be useless, Dr Kai-Wang To, one of the leading authors of the paper, told Reuters.  Immunity induced by vaccination can be dferent from those induced by natural infection, To said. [We] will need to wait for the results of the vaccine trials to seehow effective vaccines are. World Health Organisationepidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said today that there was no need to jump to any conclusions in response to the Hong Kong case. Instances of people discharged from hospitals and testing positive again for Covid- infection have been reported in mainland China.

And he predicts Jong-Unaposs younger sister will prove to be a cruel dictator.“The way for her to build up her credibility and net worth, that is, the way for her to get respect, is not to play nice but be a cruel dictator to her people and a credible nuclear threat to the US,” he told the New York Post.“She may prove herself fiercer and more tyrannical than her brother, father, or grandfather.” He saidYo-Jong does take power, she will need to be ruthless, particularly in the early years of her reign. Retired US Army Colonel David Maxwell agreed with Mr Leeaposs assertion. Col Maxwell helped devise the Pentagon’s  contingency plan with South Korea for the collapse of the North’s regime.  “I haven’t seen any evidence, any indication of how she might rule, but my speculation — given the reputation and history of the family — is that she would rule with an iron fist,” Col Maxwell said. Jong-Un was expected to be more open with the outside world when he succeeded his father Kim Jong II in . While that has not proved the case, his sister is expected to take a more abrasive stance. If she takes charge, her reign would likely be heralded by missile launches as a show of strength, according to Victor Cha, who was a director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council during the administration of former President George W. Bush.  He also predicted she would instigate a purge of government figures in order to install people loyal to herself, and would be a hard-liner with South Korea and the US. Reports that Jong-Un was in a coma circulated earlier this week, while rumours also surfaced that the North Korean leader may have died, having been seen in public only a handful of times this year. Chang Song-min, a former aide to South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung, insisted Jing-Un was still alive, telling reporters: “I assess him to be in a coma, but his le has not ended.

Linda Armstrongaposs daughter told Tarrant at his sentencing hearing that he was nothing and said like herself, he would never again feel the love and warmth of his motheraposs hug. Devastated Angela Armstrong urged him to use his le term in prison to consider the beauty in ersity he had sought to destroy when he killed  people, in a shooting rampage in Christchurch last year. Sobbing in court in Christchurch on the second day of the four day sentencing hearing, Ms Armstrong told -year-old Australian Tarrant: You robbed me of my mother, of her love and strength.Likely you will also never again feel the love and warmth of your motheraposs hug either.While I have pity for your mum, I have no emotion for you, she added. You are nothing. While he will remain trapped in a cage my mum is free. I therefore challenge Tarrant to use his remaining letime to consider the beauty and le to be found in ersity and freedom that he sought to distort and destroy.Tarrant is scheduled to be sentenced this week after pleading guilty to  murders,  attempted murders and one charge of committing a terrorist act.A murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of le in prison.The judge can impose a le term without parole, a sentence that has never been used in New Zealand. The second day in court was dedicated to allowing survivors and family members of victims to address the court, in person and via video.Tarrant sat in grey prison clothes cornered by guards as Ms Armstrong looked at him and described the ripple effects of the murder of her -year-old mother on her family.Kyron Gosse, nephew of Linda Armstrong, said the gunman had come to New Zealand as a guest, and used that privilege to destroy a family that had lived in the country for seven generations.I want you to understand my utter rage when I learnt this man was a guest to New Zealand, said Mr Gosse.He entered into our home with ill intentions and hate in his heart, only to repay our hospitality by murdering our family and our guests, people who we welcome into this country with the promise of a better le.He stole that safety and security from them, just as he stole our nationaposs innocence. Filled with his own racist agenda this coward hid behind his big powerful guns and shot little old Linda from afar. New Zealand had been relatively free from major gun violence until the countryaposs worst mass shooting. On Monday, prosecutors told the court Tarrant had carefully planned the attacks to cause maximum carnage by accumulating high-powered firearms and ammunition, training at rle clubs and studying mosque layouts.While most of Tarrantaposs victims were at Al Noor mosque, he killed seven people at the Linwood mosque, including Linda Armstrong, a convert to Islam.He was detained en route to a third mosque.Ambreen Naeem lost her husband Naeem Rashid and son Talha Naeem in the shootings.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The vehicle was in the Premier Inn car park and given his presentation and the smell of alcohol, they were under the impression that he was under the influence.”Ovenstone was taken to police headquarters just before am where he refused to provide two specimens of breath.He stated: “If you hadn’t treated me like crap I wouldn’t be so disrespectful.”Appearing from custody, Ovenstone pleaded guilty to breaching his curfew by being out with his home after pm and before am and refusing to provide the specimens of breath.Defence solicitor Paul Parker-Smith said Ovenstone and his cousin had been drinking the previous evening when they became “hungry”.Mr Parker-Smith said: “It seemed to have gone well in the sense that he was served.“He realised he may have been over the limit and took the foolish decision to refuse a specimen of breath.”Sherf George Way deferred sentence on Ovenstone for reports to be prepared and disqualied him from driving on an interim basis. He was released on bail.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Wait ages for one and suddenly three turn up at once.The three were also available for yesterday#s home victory against Livingston.Just  hours after completing a loan move from Bristol City, attacker Marley Watkins was thrown in at the deep end leading the line.Striker Bruce Anderson, unavailable for the Perth clash, was also back.Then there was a further boost just minutes before kick-off, with Curtis Main added to the squad when Craig Bryson felt his calf in the warm-up.Main had been out since knee surgery in the summer and also suffered a thigh strain during his rehabilitation.His appearance off the bench against Liv surely gives McInnes the option of going with two up top against NSI Runavik.New signing Marley Watkins was thrown straight into the action at Pittodrie just  hours after completing his loan move from Bristol City.Welsh international Watkins # who can also be played out wide # has had just  minutes of action since January, but he looked sharp and fast while leading the attack.On the basis of this debut, he can deliver goals and assists for Aberdeen. He was only denied a debut goal yesterday because of a brilliant double block from Livi keeper Robbie McCrorie.The stopper is the twin brother of Reds midfielder-defender Ross McCrorie.Aberdeen’s last appearance at Pittodrie was initially a cause for celebration as football ed to the stadium for the first time in more than five months due to the Covid- pandemic.It quickly turned sour with a turgid performance in a - loss to Rangers followed by the actions of the Aberdeen eight in attending a busy city centre bar on the night of that defeat.That plunged the Reds’ season into early chaos, but with two straight wins # away at St Johnstone and at home against Livi # they are getting it back on track, although there could be a further setback with the SFA serving notices of complaint to the eight players.They could be hit with bans of between two to eight games at Friday’s principle hearing.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

People have been using this funding in amazing ways and we want to honour them for their selfless dedication and fantastic work.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, we are seeking to recognise outstanding iniduals in the arts, education, health, environment, sport, heritage and community charity sectors. There will also be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Award winners will receive a trophy and £, for their organisation.Readers can nominate a #lockdown legend# or a #hometown hero# by visiting www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards and filling out an application form. All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project. Entries must be received by midnight on August .Jonathan Tuchner, National Lottery Awards.Sir,Mid Argyll Transport Volunteersurgently needs drivers in Tarbert.MATV is a group of volunteer drivers who take the over s and vulnerable adults to hospital appointments in Lochgilphead, Oban and Glasgow.We are increasingly short of drivers, but particularly so in Tarbert, to the point we have occasionally been unable to offer transport to major hospitals from Tarbert.Drivers can make themselves available for just one to two hours on one day a week, or as much as they want. Drivers are reimbursed at the rate of  pence per mile.If you feel you can help or wish more information please contact Margaret on    or Catherine on  .Isobel MacIntosh, secretary, MATV.Sir,News that care home residents can see up to three visitors from two households outdoors from Monday August  is welcomed.The move means a care home can expand visitingthey have been COVID-free throughout the pandemic orall affected residents have fully recovered and no residents or staff have had symptoms for  days. The home must also be participating in weekly staff testing. There will be strict criteria and infection control measures.Residents# mental health and loneliness levels will be signicantly improved by more face-to-face contact with loved ones. It will also be of huge relief to family members who, at best, have only had one designated visitor or have been reliant on video or voice calls to check in on their well-being and have a chat.For months, residents have been coping and responding to coronavirus restrictions with extremely limited contact from family and friends, many doing so in semi-isolation, which has had a signicant impact on their mental and physical health as well as increasing loneliness.The benefits to residents# well-being after being able to see and interact with one visitor has been clear for all to see, so for them this expansion can’t come soon enough. Now they may be able to see more of their children and grandchildren which will be a tremendous boost to everyone.It’s been an incredibly hard time for care home residents and staff, who have been on the front line of this pandemic, and while safety for everyone concerned is paramount these measures may bring with them ato some kind of much-needed normality for those who really need it.Adam Stachura, Age Scotland head of policy and communications."},{"url":null,"title":"time to go dotty over argyll artists","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFans of creativity are being invited to follow the red dots on the trail of this year#s Artmap Argyll.Now in its th year, there are  artists and locations open to visitors over two weekends later this month.The dates are Friday August  to Monday August , then the following weekend, both from am to pm, although visitors are advised to ring ahead to check openings for the last two days.Because of coronavirus, each space will have its own guidance in place from one-way systems to limits on numbers and visitors are asked to respect those rules to help keep everyone safe.For the first time, Artmap includes an artist on Tiree # with a virtual show, as they do not want to encourage travel to the island # with others on the trail from as far north as Glencoe to Kilberry in the south.Numbered red dots guide visitors to the artists# studios, including gardens and Kilmartin Museum giving the region#s creatives a chance to showcase their work.There is no pressure to buy, but the opportunity is available, along with the joy of meeting the artist and seeing how the work is made.

Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"castle-near-borders-now-tartan","story":"A CASTLE near the Borders has ordered a new tartan to be created as part of its major refurbishment.Colin Frame, , began working to bring Biggars Shieldhill Castle back to le in January after growing up around the old fortress and hosting his wedding there in .After the castle fell into disrepair, Mr Frame saw its potential as a \"bespoke wedding venue\", giving couples the opportunity to \"take over the whole place\".\"I grew up in the area near the castle,\" Mr Frame said. \"When it was repossessed , it was empty for two years.\"I walked in and thought it had gone downhill.

It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

In the courtyard, Saoirse Amira Anisrsquo ldquoWe can still dance, a powerful work commissioned as part of the Black Lives Matter Scottish Mural Trail.ldquoThe exhibition would have been markedly dferent, more institutional perhaps,the lockdown hadnrsquot happened, says curator Claire Feeley. Liversidge had been going to concentrate on Brexit, but Covid changed that.And yet it has all come together remarkably well, and a testament to the unique working conditions in which the artists found themselves in these last few months.Feeley tells me that Kaprow taught throughout his career, ldquoand most of what we consider his artworks were mainly done with students. The main thing he was interested in was giving a simple set of instructions, which could remain as ideas or proposals, and seem at face value simple and succinct, but then the real world hits, and when people try to follow his instructions, the problems of organisation are part of the piece. The only people who experience the happenings are the people making them themselves!Kaprow had been allowing other artists to reinvent his work since relatively early in his career, and these are the latest reincarnations.The first artwork greets you at the entrance gate, or more accurately smothers it, a barrage of Thank Yous painted by Wilsons during lockdown at the behest of Peter Liversidge. Liversidge has reworked Allan Kaprowrsquos Out Exit piece, originally created by Kaprow for Edinburgh in . The signs, brightly painted, make the entrance look like a maximised incarnation of the thank yous and rainbows placed in windows around the country over the last few months. The Wilsons have also recreated the artistrsquos Yard , blocking off their own driveway with a wall of used tyres.Liversidge, with his ldquoProposals, many of which are never carried out, is a fine fit for Kaprow, who suggested lsquohappeningsrsquo in similar vein. His ideas were off-centre, humorous, an interruption of daily le, call it what you will. In the Steadings gallery, the upper level has been cordoned off for a sign painter in Liversidgersquos reinvention of Kaprowrsquos only UK happening. There is a book provided, from which you can pick a legend to be painted on a cardboard sign to take away ndash a donation is suggested.The phrases are all taken from the words of students from around the country, part of Jupiterrsquos Youth Council, whom Liversidge spoke with prior to and during lockdown, to listen to their thoughts and concerns. From ldquoDoes the hawk see us too  to ldquoThe sound of the wind in the pines, each phrase a skein of a le that thought it during lockdown, a human concern, packed in amongst many.Upstairs in the Tin Roof Gallery, Cinzia Mutigli has created a piece that takes its inspiration from Sweet Wall, Kaprowrsquos  ldquopolitical parody, as he called it, in which he built a concrete wall, joined together with slabs of bread and jam, on a piece of wasteland near the Berlin Wall.Mutiglirsquos work, which comes closest, as Feeley points out, to fulfilling the idea of a reinvention, deals in sugar and postcolonial identity, the film an overload of words and ideas and patterns repeated over and over, sledgehammer-like, as the viewer sits and watches in the repeat-pattern wallpapered room, whilst munching Mutiglirsquos homemade jam sandwiches.Itrsquos an overwhelming piece, and one which is very personal, in that lockdown has made this film largely of the artist, the narrative a mix of personal experience and ldquoexpert analysis, each filtering in and out of comprehensibility.In the Ballroom Gallery, James Hoff, based in New York, has used a short recording made by Kaprow on how to make a happening, broadcast it to a number of radios and made up thousands of copies of original posters Kaprow made to advertise his happenings, for visitors to take away free.They are also available in art bookshops across Scotlandfor those who cannot travel to Jupiter.

There is the work of RBGE taxonomist Dr Peter Wilkie, on natural plastic from the tropical tree family, Sapotaceae, and Carla Edwardsrsquo Miscellany, a series of forms made from gutta percha, an early ldquonatural plastic. Lorna Wilsonrsquos beautul Lichen Wallis an homage to clean air lichens made ndash ironically and deliberately ndash from recycled fridges, whilst Carol Sinclairrsquos floating mobile, made from dferent plastics, is an investigation into the use and reuse of recyclable plastics. There are also ldquogreen plastics created by the University of Edinburgh ndash a nascent area of research ndash used by artists in the exhibition.What emerges, amongst many things, is that plastic is more valuable than our throwaway culture deems it, but onlyit is seen as a reuseable resource . The paradox of the whole is seen in Lorna Fraserrsquos Parasol Fungi, pictured, glass-like, made from recycled water bottles, which reflect that same air of beauty and menace found in the curious forms of nature, and in the nature of the manmade material which has been used to create these strange, delicate forms.Think Plastic: Materials and Making, Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh, John Hope Gateway, Arboretum Place, Edinburgh,   , www.rbge.org.uk Until  Nov, Daily, am-pmDONT MISSCreated entirely during lockdown, An Lanntairrsquos inspired Sketchbook Project has been created with  of the islandrsquos residents, all of whom were sent a sketchbook by the gallery, with daily email prompts for drawing.

Signicant proposed changes include enabling the children involved to express their views and changing the way these views are obtained.But unless an amendment from Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur is agreed in tomorrows debate, a key opportunity will be missed to improve the chances that children will remain equally involved with both of their parents. The vast majority of research around the world concludes that equal time or close to it has enduring benefits for the children in separated families.Mr McArthurrsquos amendment introduces a factor into court hearings that has already been successful in other progressive countries. On the request of one of the parents, the sherf hearing a court case will have to consider whether children should spend approximately equal time with each of their parents.The amendment doesnrsquot force the court to order shared care. It doesnrsquot bind the hands of a sherf or undermine the overweening principle that the sherf will put the interests of the children first. It does mean thatthere are two safe, competent, loving parents both will have the opportunity to make their case for sharing the parenting responsibilities. It creates a dferent starting point for the decision from the winner-takes-all competition we currently have in Scotland.A similar law has been in force in Belgium since . It has reduced the number of such disputes that have to be brought to court. According to Belgian family judge Marie-France Carlier, ldquothere has been a huge reduction of parental conflict in the courts as parents now know what the law says. After separation, lots of them immediately decide to set up joint physical custody before having any court decision. A change in culture has gone hand in hand with a change in the law.Only about  per cent of Belgian decisions are for a : split with around % of remaining decisions for semi-equal care, with the children spending at least five days per fortnight with one parent.Usually it is the father who ends up with less time, but this still means he can be fully involved in weekday care ndash not relegated to the visiting role of a ldquoweekend dad. If the court considers that children will not benefit from full involvement of both parents it can order whatever contact pattern is best for them.Underpinning Mr McArthurrsquos amendment is an acceptance that the current system is expensive, unpredictable and inconsistent between courts and between sherfs. It has too many disincentives to cooperation between parents at a time when they need help to make things as easy as possible for their children, not a system that encourages them to criticise each other to win time with their kids.We have heard sherfs say from the bench ndash even before hearing arguments ndash that shared parenting never works. Of course sherfs also know they never see the successes. Only the failures come back before them.Politicians in countries such as Portugal, Greece and Brazil are currently considering whether to make similar changes in their family law. Holyrood could strike a blow for parental equality this week and bring the law into line with the reality of family le in modern Scotland.Ian Maxwell is the national manager of the Shared Parenting Scotland charity"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-letters-readers-talking-week","story":"The most revealing section was former Salmond chief adviser Alex Bell saying that when Nicola Sturgeon was put in charge of the referendum campaign \"she rapidly came to the conclusion that much of what Alex Salmond had been saying doesnt stand up to the facts\"He said that \"during the run-up to the referendum Nicola Sturgeon began to see that Salmonds assertions about Scotlands wealth and how it would move on economically were kind of coming apart, and this came to a head in the first Salmond-Darling debate when, in the Green Room she could be seen to be wincing\".Mr Bell has often written that the SNP independence case is \"dead\". The fact that the current First Minister has known it all along and, even worse, the civil service people dragooned into writing and supporting it knew it, is for me a much bigger scandal than what Alex Salmond got up to or Nicola Sturgeons involvement was.The deception and hype from Mr Salmond and his team bloated the Yes result from  per cent at the start to % and have fuelled all the ision, scandal, ridiculous parades and border patrols, neglected government and ravaging uncertainty ever since.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.I WAS stunned by the blatant bias in the documentary The Trial Of Alex Salmond ,which was yet more evidence that the BBC is no longer capable of impartial reporting and that is a tragedy, given its deserved worldwide reputation. It does not augur well for its coverage of a likely second Scottish independence referendum in the near future. Kirsty Wark is a friend of prominent Labour politicians and has holidayed with a former First Minister, Jack McConnell.The documentary bore all the hallmarks of one in production in anticipation of a very dferent verdict which, perhaps, Ms Wark craved. Thirteen High Court jurors, who had heard hours of evidence, it must be remembered, decided that Mr Salmond was not guilty, despite the prosecution having the top QC from the Crown Office. This documentary seemed to fail to grasp this. Why was it even broadcast at the very time the Holyrood inquiry began This whole episode was shameful and I am saddened more than angry. The BBC follows an agenda these days whether it be Brexit, the EU, President Trump, Boris Johnson, Channel migrants, BLM, LGBT, the police, racism, Extinction Rebellion and more. Nothing figures more prominently in that agenda than the preservation of the Union of The United Kingdom. Was this documentary another salvo in that war John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.GIVE TEACHERS A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN REVIEWI AGREE with Denis Brucethat the Governments U-turn on exam results was political: youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds protesting about unfair treatment was not good \"optics\" for the SNP. Speaking as a teacher though, its been disappointing that much of the focus since seems to have been political: \"get that man out of his job\".I had hoped for a wider debate about how we examine our young people the SQAs methods of assessment are much the same as they were for the grandparents of those protesting. In my own subject,  per cent of a students award is determined by a - minute, hand-written exam. A year or two of learning boiling down to that May morning in the exam hall. Its time to look at alternatives.Within the review of SQA procedures, serious consideration should be given into allowing teacher judgment to take a more prominent role.

Grading of these assessments by teachers could be combined with the SQAs traditional assessment methods to produce a final mark. This would lower the stakes of the end-of-year exam as well as encourage more pupils to engage throughout the academic year, rather than cram at the last minute.Callum Mitchell, Largs.DENIS Bruce is lavish in his criticism of John Swinney, but in writing that Mr Swinney \"has succeeded in ramping up grade inflation, leaving employers and higher institutions wondering whether some of the results are worth the paper they are written on\", he is also insulting the intelligence and professionalism of teachers, employers and those working within the higher institutions.Given all the stramash regarding the grades awarded to young people south of the Border, questions must arise over the intelligence of their Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who might have been expected to learn from and quickly follow Mr Swinneys example, but no Mr Williamson agonisingly strung things along until finally capitulating and executing his U-turn.

Harold Wilsonrsquos Labour Government then set up a Royal Commission on the UK constitution in , recommending a devolved Scottish Assembly which was never implemented.The Scottish Constitutional Convention was formed in , comprised of representatives from local government, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Small Business Federation, the Church of Scotland and all political parties except the Conservatives, in an effort to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement. The SNP chose to withdraw from the convention as independence was not a constitutional option, and it subsequently collapsed.Ultimately in  the Labour Government under Tony Blair promised the creation of devolved institutions and a referendum was held later that year and the Scottish Parliament was re-created as a result of the Scotland Act of . Mr Blair therefore was instrumental in firing the starting pistol on the final stretch of the road towards Scottish independence by establishing devolution in an effort to silence the SNP for several generations.When a new state of the art parliament building was built, with many devolved powers granted and a large clutch of MSPs in situ a complete parliamentary machine was gted to the SNP on a plate. The only fly in the ointment is Boris Johnson, who resolutely refuses to grant a Section  order, not to mention the many compelling arguments against the breakup of the Union. On the other hand the BBC has contributed to the recent rise in support for independence by affording Nicola Sturgeon a  to grandstand on national television almost every day for the past five months. I donrsquot blame her for jumping at the chance to place the SNP firmly in front of the nation by leading these sessions and it is plain for all to see that she enjoys basking in the limelight. We all need to be briefed on developments in respect of Covid- but a short bulletin a couple of times per week would suffice.Nevertheless it has taken  years for the SNP fortunes to reach the point where independence could be imminent and it is high time for the Unionists to wake up and become more vocal before the May Holyrood elections precipitate a landslide into oblivion.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.UK press and media cite Business for Scotland Panelbase and Times YouGov August  poll figures respectively of  per cent and % support for Scottish independence. These figures exclude Donrsquot Knows and are partial, inflated \"headline figures\" that provide a basis for misleading reporting.Actual Panelbase and YouGov poll figures respectively show For % and %, Against % and %, Donrsquot Knows % and % . These produce simple averages of For .%, Against .%, Donrsquot Knows %.Support for independence has been rising over , is clearly higher than for remaining within the UK and lies around % . However, whether or not there is majority support for independence is not proven and there has not yet been sustained majority support over a period of time demonstrated for independence. There is therefore no convincing opinion poll case at present to support a second independence referendum. Nor has there been any reversal of the  Referendum   result, contrary to the misleading statement by Business for Scotland .Use of actual poll figures including Donrsquot Knows at the \"headline level\" are essential for objective use of statistics and balance of reporting.Whether or not the Panelbase poll of a % majority for independence continues to be reflected across dferent polls and strengthens over a sustained period of time is an issue, though so also is what happens to the Donrsquot Knows.The level of support for Scotland remaining within the UK has fallen signicantly since  at currently .% , a reflection of Scottish views on Brexit and Conservative governments since  the success of the SNP and First Minister on public perceptions of performance and confusion over UK and Scottish government responsibilities.Dont Knows might well be expected though to vote for the status quo given financial uncertainties and risks. YouGov states \"polling has shown % think the country would be worse off economicallyindependent, compared to % who think better off\". Adding together the above averaged Against and Dont Knows would produce a . .% result against Scottish independence. This is an uncertain proposition that could only be tested in a referendum, but is as much a reasonable proposition for consideration and debate as using partial inflated   and   figures that exclude Donrsquot Knows.John Garrity, Chichester.PETER A Russells concern for Alex Salmond and Scotlands justice systemhas a hollow ring to it, but I agree thatthere was a plot to have Mr Salmond thrown into jail for crimes he did not commit, it is certainly a most serious matter. Surely,anyone has evidence of such a thing the correct procedure would be to immediately contact the police, as the withholding of evidence is also a serious crime.However, I strongly suspect that, in the first place, there is no evidence because there was no plot, and in the second place, that Mr Russells demand for justice to be done is more to do with the latest opinion poll, showing support for Scottish independence now standing at  per cent, rather than any real concern for Mr Salmond and the justice system.Ruth Marr, Stirling.It is touching to witness Peter A Russells eagerness to see Alex Salmond obtain justice for himself and Scotlands criminal justice system. In support, he cites the observations of another two of yesterdays men, Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill.I am afraid that the latter lost a lot of my respect due to his handling of the Al-Megrahi situation. Dr Jim Swire tirelessly pursued the need for a review of the case providing evidence of several flaws in the trial in the Hague carried out under the jurisdiction of the Scottish justice system. Mr MacAskill refused to accept that there was any doubt as to Al-Megrahis guilt and he defended the Crown Prosecution services evidence virtually without question. Thereafter, he could not arrange the transfer of the convicted man to Libya quickly enough. This may well have been the start of the downturn of his own political career.It saddens me that Mr Salmond and the others cannot accept their diminished influence in the SNP and appear intent on undermining the cause of independence that they have worked so hard to deliver. The former party leader has been cleared of all charges against him even though his reputation has been tarnished by some of his own admissions during the trial. He has little to gain from washing any dirty linen in public, an outcome which Mr Russell is clearly hoping will damage the cause of independence which he hates so much.Gordon Evans, Burnside.I PREFACE my comments by saying there is no acceptable level for crimes against the person including sexual assault and rape. However, itrsquos appalling and a sad indictment of pathetic state of the opposition at Holyrood that Tory MSPS Liam Kerr would attempt to make political capital out of a blip in Julyrsquos sexual crime statistics . When taken in conjunction with the previous three months the levels of sexual crimes are actually substantially reduced.If Mr Kerr believes Police Scotland is underfunded then perhaps he could do something constructive and ask his masters in Westminster to increase the Block Grant after all what Westminster begrudgingly gives Holyrood to run the country is less than half the revenue generated in Scotland.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ON Friday Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard delivered a keynote speech, unveiling plans to transform the Scottish economy.

A heavy emphasis on law and order and protecting the suburbs is expected. But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same.

A comprehensive revaluation should be set in hand which would give the basis both for a fairer property tax and for a land value tax, both to be introduced within five years. Local authorities should also be permitted a wider range of local taxes, which could include a tourist tax and workplace parking levies. Community councils should be enabled as of right to levy a small precept on the council tax instead of being dependent on local authority handouts. The balance of council income would come from the Scottish Government, which controls income tax levels, and would be at a iable level so that richer areas would receive less per head of population than poorer areas.This approach, primarily taxing land, property and income, would mean that Scotland could have a fairer and more progressive taxation system even within the constraints laid down by Westminster.David Mumford, Dunbar.NOT SO GREENYOU report on SSE Renewable`s new Viking wind farm near Shetland.

We are, as always, advised that some work will be offered to local labour but by far, the bulk of the turbine installation and manufacture goes to other countries.Wind turbines are always being promoted as green energy, but no thought has been given to the amount of fossil fuel used in their manufacture nor transport and installation. Another major cost, overlooked on all of their promotion, is the cost of decommissioning after the  to -year lespan and the subsequent disposable of currently unrecyclable turbine blades, the bulk being taken to landfill.George Dale, Beith.GAELIC FOLLYIT seems the force feeding of Gaelic continues apace.

True, le expectancy in the UK has increased steadily for decades, though the Office for National Statistics points out that it has signicantly levelled off since .And the current pandemic has jolted us all into a new sense of urgency, with increasing numbers deciding to make a will ndash a rise accompanied by a new interest in the power of attorney, which anticipates the possibility that someone, for reasons of age or health, may have to allow another to deal with their affairs.Scott Ewart, managing partner at Glasgow-based legal services firm Thomas Bradley and Co, believes that granting power of attorney is arguably even more important than making a will.ldquoSomeone losing capacity without having appointed an attorney ndash someone who can formally act on their behalf ndash could end up in a terrible situation.ldquoPeople often assume that when they write a will and appoint an executor, that person ndash often one of their children ndash will deal with all those issues including power of attorney but thats not the case, he says.ldquoWe can advise them about the dference between a will, which takes care of your affairs after you have passed away and a power of attorney that ensures your affairs are taken care of should you lose the capacity to manage them yourself.There are two types of power of attorney in Scotland: that relating to financial property affairs which you can decide to begin immediately or onlyyou become incapable and welfare power of attorney, which allows someone to make welfare decisions for you should you lose the capacity to make these decisions.Incapacity, Ewart points out, can affect the simplest aspects of le. ldquoPeople tend to think in terms of a crisis, such as someone being affected by Alzheimerrsquos, but power of attorney can be important for someone who is just struggling physically, he says.ldquoI think of my grandmother who at  is mentally as sharp as a tack but set up a power of attorney as through illness she simply wasnrsquot able get out to take care of basic essentials such as going to the post office for her pension. Someone may also need their son or daughter to make sure gas or electricity bills are looked after and that the shopping is done.Which means that the person granted powers of attorney must be someone you can trust implicitly ndash and someone who also feels comfortable with acting formally on anotherrsquos behalf. Some people find it dficult to discuss with a parent that they face losing capacity through an illness.\"So the right person isnrsquot just someone you trust but someone who can also handle the potential emotional stress of a being an attorney, he says.Appointing an attorney can be a sensitive matter but the person granted power can subsequently be altered. ldquoPeople can and do come to us after several years ndash and after circumstances have altered ndash to change the person in whom power of attorney resides or add someone , but most people tend to appoint their children or grandchildren, he says.ldquoAnd they try to share the responsibility between two or three people, making the person best able to deal with their affairs the primary attorney, with one or two substitutes.ldquoIf there are no substitutes in place and the principal attorney passes away or moves to another country after the person who has appointed them loses capacity then no one  can be appointed, he adds.The Office of the Public provides the registration service for powers of attorney and can help people who have no knowledge of whatrsquos involved. Ewart explains: ldquoTherersquos a lot of support for the many people who initially have no idea what to do and the OPG ensures that people who grant powers of attorney or put them in place are protected and that trust companies are doing their job properly.ldquoIt receives a one-off fee for that and is always there to give general advice on what you should or shouldnrsquot do, thoughlegal or financial advice is needed you should consult an appropriate adviser.And while itrsquos possible for an inidual to set up a power of attorney, Ewart says itrsquos a complicated process that involves solicitors and GPs ensuring that multiple documents are signed off correctly by the persons family members. ldquoEngaging a professional who can complete the process online removes the most onerous part of the exercise, making sure itrsquos dated, checked and signed off correctly and most importantly, that itrsquos registered, he says.The company has seen a signicant increase in requests for powers of attorney: ldquoItrsquos becoming a priority for more people and % to % of the people we talk to about wills every month now set up a power of attorney at the same time.He says that while this does not represent a major financial decision, many people are seeing their incomes squeezed at the moment so Thomas Bradley is currently halving its price for the service. ldquoWhile recognising that ndash like every other company ndash we must make money I feel we have an obligation not to have profits solely in mind at the moment and offer a service thatrsquos affordable. If wersquore going to do something positive for the community, now is the time to do it.thomasbradleyco "},{"url":null,"title":"humiliating-leaked-labour-memo-party-branded-morris-minor-politics","story":"Confidential documents prepared ahead of the  General Election advised the party should target seats in England and Wales rather than attempt to win back seats from the SNP.The SNP have jumped on the leak, which was circulated online, saying it shows the party is \"finished\" in Scotland and describing it as the \"Morris Minor of politics\".Scottish Labour party sources told The Herald the document was \"humiliating, particularly in its outdated references to religion and the assumption that we shouldnt be trying to win against the SNP.\":Kevin McKenna: There is a reason why Scottish Labour is dyingThe key seats strategy\" document states: \"There is no evidence that organisational investment in Scottish seats will deliver improved electoral outcomes and there is abundant evidence from the analysis of recent general elections that spending money in contests where we are not competitiveis a much less efficient way of achieving changed electoral outcomes than investing in tighter electoral contests where in Britain.ldquoTo achieve any given small percentage increase in vote share for Labour in a seat in Scotland where we are not regarded by the electorate as a serious rival to the incumbent requires a substantially larger investment of human and financial resources than in a seat in England or Wales where we are so regarded.On constituency and polling data, it states: \" There were dferences for Scotland, where data availability is slightly more limited.\"Some constituency-level demographics, such as employment categories and percentage in poor health, were absent.\"However, one iable ndash proportion of Catholic residents by constituencyndash was included for Scotland for the purpose of helping to distinguish better between Labour and SNP supporters.\"Currently, Labour only have one MP in Scotland - the partys shadow secretary of state Ian Murray.Party leader Richard Leonard has come under fire from within Scottish Labour in recent months, with accusations that he is not well-known enough or is not cutting through with voters.:\"Utterly humiliating\" defeat for Richard Leonard as executive rejects IndyRef conference proposalLast week Mr Leonard made a key note speech setting out his vision for Scotland - a move which was widely thought to be an attempt to boost his profile.He has been plagued by leaks from within his own party and briefings against him since he took over as leader in .SNP Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil said: ldquoLabour are finished in Scotland.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme. Karen Johnston, from OLA, said: “We are delighted and very honoured to give our members the opportunity to benefit from expert information and support from such a prestigious and well respected organisation.  We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership progresses and the benefits it brings to Orkney farmers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

It#s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it#s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven#t even thought of yet.Ms White added: However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid-. We need a clear and robust plan, something like a flow chart, for instance, with step by step guidance on what to do, who needs to be isolated and how long they need to be out of school and so on.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEducation Minister, Peter Weir speaks to pupils at St Joseph’s Primary School in Carryduf FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEducation Minister, Peter Weir speaks to pupils at St Joseph’s Primary School in CarrydufMr Weir, who visited St Joseph#s Primary School in Carryduff, expressed confidence that appropriate safety measures have been put in place.

It says that actual losses to the sector here stand at £.m for the last six months alone but it warns that the figure is likely to reach double that by the end of the yearA statement says: To compound matters further, many arts organisations which rely heavily on income generated through box office, a model decimated by social distancing, are now facing a socially distanced Christmas season ahead, normally one of the most profitable times of year for the arts.The hugely popular Grand Opera House pantomime, which had been due to star May McFettridge in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, has been postponed for a year after Covid- delayed work on a massive refurbishment programme.Officials at the Millennium Forum in Derry Londonderry have also postponed their panto, Sleeping Beauty, for  months.The ACNI says it has been working closely with the Department for Communities to support arts organisation, inidual artists and freelances whose work in the creative sector has been decimated.The council says it and the Department have put together a series of emergency funding initiatives.But the ACNI warned: Short term measures now will not save the arts and entertainment infrastructure nor many of those who work within it, from artists to lighting technicians, drivers to musicians. Their work has completely disappeared and the future is uncertain.It is crucial that the arts and creative sectors are supported and sustained with further investment now and over the coming years in order to plan and deliver arts programming - programming and activities that are so important to our night time economy, to cultural tourism and to the health and wellbeing of the many iniduals most in need in our communities.The ACNI says that assistance for the arts has included: l Fty per cent of the £.m in annual core grants being paid up front to support  key arts organisations in April .l Two hundred and twenty four funding awards being made to inidual artists, totalling £,, in May June  through the Artists Emergency Programme .l The opening of the Iniduals Emergency Resilience Programmein July, worth £.m from the Department for Communities and from Future Screens NI, offering grants to iniduals working in the creative sector. l One hundred and fty funding awards being made to arts organisations, totalling £.m, through the Organisations Emergency Programme , with a second round of the programme opening soon.l The imminent opening of a capital funding programme to help arts organisations prepare for a safe reopening of venues and performance spaces.The ACNI has already said it is continuing to press government for parity of esteem in public investment in the arts here, to close the gap on spending per head of the population in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic.Last week Game of Thrones and Derry Girls star Ian McElhinney called for more government and ACNI backing for struggling actors and technicians and said he hoped funds would be directed at professionals in the industry rather than being erted to community projects.

Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose.

Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

Yet for all the hoopla underpinning Sinn Fein’s our-day-will-come project their so-called ‘inevitable’ unity cannot be taken for granted. Likewise, Micheál Martin’s ‘beefed-up’ Shared Island Unit may have irked unionism a couple of weeks ago, but even he would admit that there is nothing inevitable about a united Ireland. But regular readers will know that I’m a be-ready-for-all-outcomes-and-possibilities kind of guy. I’ve said many, many times that I’m an unambiguous, unapologetic unionist and I can conceive of no circumstance in which I would swap my citizenship of the United Kingdom for citizenship of a united Ireland. That said, I’m not afraid of a debate on the subject and I have no objection to any party which wants to make the case for unity by entirely democratic means. I’m aware there are unionists who believe taking part in the debate risks conveying the impression you think unity has become a serious possibility. Yet in not taking part – or failing to even make your own case from a separate  – there’s also the risk of allowing your political opponents to gain traction. The problem, as we now know, is that once that happens it becomes very dficult to catch-up with your own counter-message and narrative, let alone gain an edge and take the lead in terms of input and impact. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Peter Robinson and Mike Nesbitt at the announcement of the subsequently short-lived Unionist Forum in January I noted in the column a couple of weeks ago that John Hume had more specic, lasting influence on successive UK governments than had any unionist equivalent. That’s because he took his case – at a time when people were barely even listening to local nationalism, because the electoral gap between unionism and non-unionism was so wide – to anyone and everyone who would open a door and incline an ear in London, Dublin, Washington or Brussels . That’s why so much of what used to be mocked by unionists as ‘Hume-speak’ found its way into government policy and subsequent political initiatives.With Northern Ireland’s centenary just around the cornerthere are a number of issues for unionists to consider. A centenary celebration will, by its very nature, focus attention on the past but it also involves surveying the presentand preparing for the future.In terms of the challenges unionists face, here are a number off the top of my head. The clash between the competing nationalisms across the United Kingdom the surge, influence and interests of a rebooted English nationalismthe rise of Scottish nationalism and Sinn Fein the combined impact of finally leaving the EU without a deal and the massive economic hit the UK has already taken from the pandemic the closing electoral gap between unionism and nationalism in Northern Ireland the rise of what can best be described as the ‘other’ demographic in Northern Ireland and how it can be kept within the pro-UK camp the outcome of an independence referendum in Scotlandand, of course, the looming shadow of a border poll .In September , at a dinner celebrating the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, Peter Robinson spoke about creating a Council for the Union to prepare for the  celebrations. Now, unless it is meeting and preparing and planning well below the radar I’m not aware of anything on the scale of which he was talking. And while it’s true that he and Mike Nesbitt jointly convened a Unionist Forum in January it is also true that it collapsed within a few months – with quite a few cross words.At this point I have no ideawhat Boris Johnson imagines will emerge from his Forum and Panel discussions. I don’t knowhe has given them a steer or an outline from which to work, orhe just intends to let them do their own thing as long as they provide him with an opportunity to do one of his rambling, hand-me-down Churchillian addresses to the nation. My fear – and it isn’t just a passing one, by the way – is that his references to Northern Ireland and ‘Ulster’ unionism will be so ambiguous and let’s-not-offend-anyone-at-all as to be utterly meaningless.In  Brian Faulkner fronted a three-day debate in the NI Parliament to mark the first half-centenary. In the absence of a unionist majority in the Assembly I’m not sure Arlene Foster would even consider such a debate. There’s no unionist majority in Belfast City Council, either so no cheerleading for the Union there. Who knows what Covid- restrictions might still be imposed upon us in the first six months of , orpublic celebrations of the Unionwill even be possible.Yet whatever happens it strikes me as essential that a united, coherent, pro-Union, pro-UKmessage is heard from unionism within Northern Ireland. Yes, we have serious challengesand issues from which we would be extraordinarily stupid to shy away but our identity, citizenship, political beliefs and sense of belonging to a pan-UK family is worth commemorating and celebrating.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Now from next week all pupils should be back full time and we have only had limited time to assess exactly what that will mean,” she said. n“Schools are finding that even some classrooms they had been going to use are no longer suitable given the numbers they’re now expected to see. n“It’s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it’s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven’t even thought of yet. n “However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid n“We need a clear and robust plan, something like a flow chart, for instance, with step by step guidance on what to do, who needs to be isolated and how long they need to be out of school and so on. n“It will be especially challenging as we enter the winter where so many children are affected by colds and coughs anyway. The guidance states that any child with any kind of respiratory issue, like coughing, should be isolated and tested immediately so we need to have those robust measures to hand. n“If it turns out to be Covid then again we need to have measures in place to protect others in the environment so we must have access to testing and tracing. n“As for the wearing of face coverings, that must be based on medical advice and that seems to be suggesting there is benefit to be had by wearing them. But again we appreciate that isn’t always practicable for children or young people. n“However, there seems to be a suggestion among some that teachers have an issue with going back to school. This could not be further from the case. As teachers we of all people realise that the best place for children is in school. n“Teachers are as keen as everyone , perhaps more so, to get children back in class but it is imperative that every possible measure is in place to ensure everyone is as safe as possible.” n n\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":\"https:www.newsletter webimg

In a statement Ballyclare Secondary has said it will not be opening on Monday after a pupil tested positive for Covid-.The principal of Ballyclare Secondary School said the pupil had been in the school on Thursday,  August and it would reopen on Tuesday.On Friday it was announced that St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road in west Belfast would not be reopening as planned after someone connected to the school tested positive for coronavirus.And St Louise’s College, also on the Falls Road, also confirmed a positive case of Covid- among the school community.Yesterday the Department of Health COVID- report revealsed that  people have tested positive in the last  hours.Earlier a statement was released from the Chief Medical Officers and Deputy Chief Medical Officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales on the evidence of risks and benefits to health from schools and childcare settings reopening. It says: “The current global pandemic means that there are no risk-free options, but it is important that parents and teachers understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.ChildrenWe are confident that multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the le chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues. School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout the le course including employment. It has not been possible to reduce societal inequalities through the provision of home-based education alone. School attendance is very important for children and young people.We are confident in the extensive evidence that there is an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from COVID-. The infection fatality ratefor those aged  to  is estimated at  per million, lower than for most seasonal flu infections. Every death of a child is a tragedy but COVID- deaths in children and teenagers are fortunately extremely rare and almost all deaths are in children with signicant pre-existing health conditions.We are confident that there is clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children of primary and secondary school ages compared to adults, eventhey catch COVID-. The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be .% for children aged  to  and .% among those aged  to , compared to a hospitalisation rate of over % in the UK for the general population. Most of these children make a rapid recovery.We are confident that there is clear evidence from many studies that the great majority of children and teenagers who catch COVID- have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.There is reasonable, but not yet conclusive, evidence that primary school age children have a signicantly lower rate of infection than adults .Evidence that older children and teenagers are at lower risk of catching COVID- is mixed. They are either less likely to catch COVID- than adults or have the same risk as adults.Transmission of COVID- to children in schools does occur. On current evidence it is probably not a common route of transmission. It may be lower in primary age children than secondary age children.Control measures such as hand and surface hygiene, cohorting to reduce number of daily contacts, and directional controls to reduce face-to-face contact remain key elements of maintaining COVID- secure school environments and minimising risk.Children and young people who were previously shielding were identied on a precautionary basis at a stage when we had less data on the effects of COVID- in children than we do now. Based on our better understanding of COVID- the great majority have now been advised they do not need to do so again, and that they shouldto school. A small number of children under paediatric carehave been or will be given inidual advice about any ongoing need to avoid infection.Our overall consensus is that, compared to adults, children may have a lower risk of catching COVID- , definitely have a much lower rate of hospitalisation and severe disease, and an exceptionally low risk of dying from COVID-. Very few,any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from COVID- due solely to attending school. This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.Teachers, other school staff and parentsData from the UKsuggest teachers are not at increased risk of dying from COVID- compared to the general working-age population. ONS data identies teaching as a lower risk profession . International data support this.Transmission of COVID- to staff members in school does occur, and data from UK and international studies suggest it may largely be staff to staffrather than pupil to staff. This reinforces the need to maintain social distancing and good infection control inside and outside classroom settings, particularly between staff members and between older children and adults.If teachers, other school staff, parents or wider family catch COVID- their risks of severe illness are similar to those of other adults of the same age, ethnicity and health status. Younger adults have a much lower risk of severe COVID- than older adults. The greatest risk is to those over  years old.Current international evidence suggests transmission of COVID- from children of school age to parents or other adult family members is relatively rare compared to transmission from adults, but this evidence is weak. Teenagers may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children.Children and young people should be engaged in the process of establishing COVID- secure measures as key participants and promoters of safe communities to help protect their wider families, teachers and other school staff and other social networks. This will help reduce the risk of school outbreaks.Impact of opening schools on wider transmission Because schools connect households it is likely opening schools will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely and therefore increase R. We have confidence in the current evidence that schools are much less important in the transmission of COVID- than for influenza or some other respiratory infections. Other work and social environments also increase risk and are likely to be more important for transmission of COVID-.The international real-world evidence suggests that reopening of schools has usually not been followed by a surge of COVID- in a timescale that implies schools are the principal reason for the surge. There has, however, not been sufficient time to say this with confidence.On the other hand, a local or national surge in transmission in the community may lead to an increased risk of school outbreaks occurring.Opening schools may be as important in linking households indirectly as through direct transmission in school. For example allowing parents to go back to work, or meeting at the school gates, on public transport or in shared private vehicles, via after school social or sport activities or wrap-around care may be as important as what happens within the school.It is possible that opening schools will provide enough upward pressure on R that it goes above  having previously been below it, at least in some local areas. This will require local action and could mean societal choices that weigh up the implications of imposing limitations on dferent parts of the community and the economy.Early identication and quickly managing outbreaks of COVID- in schools is essential as part of a local response to COVID-. Clear advice for pupils and staff not to attend school with symptoms, and prompt availability of testing, appropriate isolation advice, and careful public health surveillance and monitoring of educational establishments are key to support the safeto schools”._________________________________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Now from next week all pupils should be back full time and we have only had limited time to assess exactly what that will mean,” she said.“Schools are finding that even some classrooms they had been going to use are no longer suitable given the numbers they’re now expected to see.“It’s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it’s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven’t even thought of yet. “However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid“We need a clear and robust plan, something like a flow chart, for instance, with step by step guidance on what to do, who needs to be isolated and how long they need to be out of school and so on.“It will be especially challenging as we enter the winter where so many children are affected by colds and coughs anyway. The guidance states that any child with any kind of respiratory issue, like coughing, should be isolated and tested immediately so we need to have those robust measures to hand.“If it turns out to be Covid then again we need to have measures in place to protect others in the environment so we must have access to testing and tracing.“As for the wearing of face coverings, that must be based on medical advice and that seems to be suggesting there is benefit to be had by wearing them. But again we appreciate that isn’t always practicable for children or young people.“However, there seems to be a suggestion among some that teachers have an issue with going back to school. This could not be further from the case. As teachers we of all people realise that the best place for children is in school.“Teachers are as keen as everyone , perhaps more so, to get children back in class but it is imperative that every possible measure is in place to ensure everyone is as safe as possible.”Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Mixture of excitement and concern as Northern Ireland pupilsto schools for first time since MarchThere was a mixture of excitement and trepidation among parents and pupils as schools reopened following lockdown.Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Monday,  August, , :\"\"Millions in extra cash to help NI schools reopen | ‘I fully recognise the stresses felt by teachers, parents and pupils’Millions in extra funding to help Northern Ireland schools pay for the extra costs of reopening in a pandemic has been announced.Monday,  August, , :\"\"Education Minister Peter Weir has said that opening schools was probably the \"top priority\" for the executive.However, a County Antrim school has said it will not be opening on Monday after a pupil tested positive for Covid-.The principal of Ballyclare Secondary School said the pupil had been in the school on Thursday,  August.\"Our school is cleaned every day and was cleaned on Friday afternoon,\" said Kathryn Bell on Sunday.\"However, to comply with guidance, our school will not be open tomorrow to allow for the -hour incubation period from the last clean.\"She added: \"The school building will be a safe place toto on Tuesday,  August.\"On Friday it was announced that St Kevins Primary School on the Falls Road in west Belfast would not be reopening as planned after someone connected to the school tested positive for coronavirus.St Louises College, also on the Falls Road, also confirmed a positive case of Covid- among the school community.Page  out of gtgt\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
