At Warsaw airport he bumped into Lech Wałęsa, Nobel peace laureate and veteran leader of Solidarity, the Gdańsk-based trade union movement which played such a crucial role in the end of communism in 1989. “Be careful out there,” Wałęsa warned Tusk. “I worry that the EU will break up, and they chose a Pole so that they have someone to blame.”Tusk was heading to Brussels as a passionate European, a staunch defender of what he called “fundamental” European values: solidarity, freedom and unity in the face of threats from inside and out. But Wałęsa’s words may have been prophetic. Tusk’s two-term stint, which has just ended, coincided with Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the euro crisis in Greece, devastating terrorist attacks in cities across Europe, the 2015 refugee crisis which fuelled the rise of populism, and of course Brexit. If that wasn’t enough, the US elected Donald Trump, who launched a series of trade wars.Now Tusk has published the diary he kept during his time running the EU. The book, which he calls Szczerze (Frankly), is out in Polish (not yet translated into English), and in it Tusk takes us behind the scenes to show how these tumultuous events were handled in Brussels. That Brexit dominates this political memoir perhaps isn’t surprising, but the extent to which it is such a romantic topic for Tusk is. Even Brexiteers are sick of Brexit, but Tusk’s faith that Britain’s exit might be stopped was unfailing right to the end of the withdrawal negotiations. A master of hopeless situations, Tusk’s skill is to reduce them to simple rules and apply cold pragmatism. Confronted with the global financial crisis just a year after becoming Polish prime minister in 2007, he managed to keep Poland out of recession, the only country in Europe to do so. And when it came to Brexit it was as if Tusk thought the UK, the home of pragmatism and rational thinking, had gone crazy and had to be ministered to by an outsider. Doggedly he sought a compromise to allow an orderly UK exit, even if, as his diary shows, he dreamed of a second referendum. On 13 July 2016 he wrote: “In the evening I sent my congratulations to the newly nominated prime minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May. In the coming months I will probably spend more time with her than with my own family.” In the following months and years, Tusk strove to protect May and her beleagured beleaguered ministers from their increasingly impatient opponents within the EU.This was a difficult balancing act because as an EU leader he was obligated to represent its interests. In the most isive crisis the EU has faced, Tusk appears to have fought for both sides: the UK’s interests in Brussels and EU (especially Ireland’s) interests in the UK. Sometimes he had to stiffen Angela Merkel’s resolve and oppose Emmanuel Macron’s anger. Often he used his brand of humour to break down the EU’s dismal newspeak: “A journalist suggests that the EU wants to punish the UK for Brexit. I answer that Brexit itself is punishment enough.” Throughout, he maintained a strong affection for the British, for whom he sees a special place in heaven. On some of Europe’s big challenges, it’s hard not to conclude that Tusk displayed better instincts than other EU leaders. Take the refugee crisis. Merkel’s open border policy was clear from a moral standpoint, but it proved politically counterproductive. Moral victories that lead to political disaster are something Poland is familiar with. What is the benefit of admitting one or two million refugees if that leads to populist victories and inspires millions more to cross the Mediterranean to face populists who have no interest in helping them? Going against what is right to ensure that a worse evil does not win is a difficult choice for any politician. Tusk’s priorities were the inverse of those of most western leaders: first strengthen the borders, then relocate and assist the refugees. Today, most European leaders – including Merkel – see things this way.It also meant a lot that when he visited the capitals of new member states or eastern European allies, he spoke in their languages: Ukrainian, Croatian, Bulgarian and even Montenegrin. Dignity meant more than money. Many Polish liberals placed their hopes for a defeat of Jarosław Kaczyński’s populist Law and Justice (PiS) party in Tusk’s return to Polish politics. After all, Tusk defeated Kaczyński eight times between 2006 and 2014. But after polling showed that he stood no chance of winning against incumbent Andrzej Duda in the upcoming presidential election, he opted out. Memories remain strong of unpopular policies his government introduced in 2007-2014, including raising the retirement age. The pro-government Polish media’s attempts to undermine Tusk also counted against him.Tusk had no desire to retire from politics and watch events unfolding on TV. The truth is, however, that he would have had a greater chance of resurrecting his political career in any EU country but today’s Poland. Instead he has become head of the centre-right EPP group in the European parliament. In this role he faces a challenge to his beloved European project which is existentially bigger even than Brexit. He must resolve the problem that no one in the EU has so far been able to: the Hungarian premier, Viktor Orbán. Fidesz, Orbán’s populist party, is now destroying liberal democracy, whipping up antisemitism and turning Hungary into a state where politics is run like the mafia. Orbán conspires with Poland’s Kaczyński to block EU efforts to restore the rule of law in both countries.Fidesz should of course be expelled from the EPP, but its spineless leaders have so far failed to do so, allowing the biggest democratically elected political grouping in Europe to be held hostage. Tragically for Tusk, there’s a personal conflict: he and Orbán share a genuine friendship, something Tusk has never hidden. Orbán supported Tusk’s re-election to the EU job in 2017, betraying Kaczyński in the process. Now Tusk, the passionate European, who strained every sinew to keep Britain in the EU club, must choose between the democratic values he rightly espouses as the bedrock of the EU’s existence, and loyalty to an undeserving friend. He risks, as Wałęsa prophetically warned, being blamed if the EU fractures further. But on fundamental values, there can be no compromise. • Sławomir Sierakowski is a Polish writer, founder of the Krytyka Polityczna (Political Critique) movement, and director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Warsaw"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8ef52dfab97229c5c2bfd623f5ed543fb88356/269_317_2060_1236/master/2060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb222c5454d417120425fa9ab2203f","title":"next phase brexit messy","story":"With the clock ticking, a low-alignment deal with the EU now seems likely, but it comes with great risksBoris Johnson’s honeymoon was always going to be short-lived. The immediate, unexpected, reason is the sudden escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. But it won’t be long before Brexit once again dominates the headlines.With the UK set to leave the EU on 31 January, and both sides set to embark on trade negotiations shortly thereafter, the prime minister, his senior ministers and his key aides are keen to lower the temperature. “We want to see Brexit on the business pages, not the front pages,” says one ally.Two key factors will determine whether this aim is achieved. First, will Johnson stick to his decision ruling out any extension to the transition period, in effect imposing a 31 December deadline for concluding a free trade deal with the EU? Second, will he make good on his desire to “erge” from EU rules and standards, thereby prioritising the government’s right to do things differently over preferential access to the single market?The initial signals aren’t promising for industry. Johnson will politely dismiss EU warnings that his timetable is unrealistic when he meets the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street on Wednesday. Although he now commands an 80-strong parliamentary majority, extending the transition, and thereby remaining in the single market and customs union with no say over their rules while handing over wads more cash, would seriously anger Eurosceptic MPs and some voters. Senior ministers also believe that the very tight deadline will concentrate minds in Brussels. “We will not extend the transition under any circumstances,” one Downing Street source told me.This will leave seven months to hammer out a deal. The EU’s 27 member states will only agree on the commission’s mandate to negotiate on their behalf by the end of February. The cabinet and Whitehall will also need time to settle on a final policy. Ratification of the deal will probably take two to three months. In a best-case scenario, that leaves March to September – about seven negotiating cycles – to strike an agreement. It’s an understatement to suggest this might not be long enough.The prime minister hopes the arrival of Von der Leyen in place of Jean-Claude Juncker will mark a new start, as the two “friends and partners” agree a new relationship. He will also work hard to build personal rapport with EU leaders. Just as bonding with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, unblocked the withdrawal agreement talks, he will hope that strong relationships with other EU capitals could smooth the trade talks, too. But even if things are more cordial than during the orce – and that is a big “if” – the challenge Johnson is setting himself is immense. The risk of a no-deal cliff edge at the end of the year will remain a key concern for financial markets and businesses.The second, arguably bigger, problem is that many at the top of government see erging from EU rules as the big prize of Brexit. While legislation enshrining existing EU standards in the areas of workers’ rights and the environment is likely, it’s doubtful this government will agree to follow EU rules in the future. Some senior ministers argue that alignment might actually be easier now as it will be the UK’s choice, but it’s hard to square this approach with the worldview and instincts of those now in power. Indeed, Johnson’s allies rightly point out that his opposition to both Theresa May’s Chequers deal and her withdrawal agreement was not because of details but because he believed it was fundamentally and philosophically the wrong approach.Could he prove more pragmatic – just as he was when he pulled off the withdrawal agreement against the odds? Perhaps, but probably only when talks reach a climax in the autumn. After all, not agreeing to follow EU rules would make it difficult to defend manufacturing industries from EU tariffs and regulatory barriers – in plain English, there would be a risk of substantial job cuts and factory closures. The newly elected band of Tory MPs from the north and the Midlands will be anxious to avoid that, and this might prompt a rethink. In the end, the government could be tempted to follow EU rules in sectors such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.But this is not a given. Senior voices in the cabinet tell me that the Tories’ new working-class former Labour voters are likely to be used as a justification to deliver a quick deal to deadline and for a tougher approach to immigration. The PM’s aides also acknowledge they will need a big selling operation to explain any new barriers to trade: “We will not go for high alignment that will mean trade-offs.” Another minister says that “standing up to the EU won’t play badly with these voters. There will be a deep reservoir of support for the PM if he wants to play tough with Brussels.” To the extent there are jobs that need protecting, this could lead to a more assertive industrial policy – including “buy British” procurement rules and state aid for companies struggling to survive, both of which will cause tensions with Brussels.A final, unresolved tension inside the government is whether to use the prospect of a US-UK trade deal to put pressure on the EU to make concessions. Some ministers want to go all out for “global Britain” from 1 February others want to prioritise the EU and believe such threats could be counterproductive.Given all of the above, a scrappy, relatively unambitious, low-alignment trade deal is arguably the most plausible landing zone, in contrast to a deal that keeps both sides economically close and the UK locked into the EU’s regulatory orbit. The risk of tariffs, not just regulatory barriers, is real. Despite hopes for a less fraught “phase II”, it seems likely that the UK’s noisy Brexit psychodrama isn’t going to quieten down any time soon.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director of Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d22450d88e94b5ea649dbec81ba0ca5d434b137/522_433_5716_3430/master/5716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9f6d9b90e7aca276b10b53db2b703de","title":"nuclear button question labour leadership candidates","story":"We are all going to die. Since the end result is the same, perhaps the way it happens shouldn’t matter, but it does. Given the choice, I’d rather not burn to death.This is probably why the spectre of nuclear war remains so frightening, despite being highly unlikely. The radiation poisoning and horrific injuries we saw in the television series Chernobyl were a reminder of a time when we lived in vivid fear of the power of the atom, whether in the form of a missile or a meltdown.So the nuclear threat as a preoccupation of our collective consciousness makes sense. But the outsize role it plays in our political discourse is hard to justify. The circumstances in which a nuclear weapon would be used by the UK are so far-fetched that nobody can really describe what they are. And yet every contender for the leadership of a national party is forced to answer the simplistic question: would you push the button?Jeremy Corbyn has been goaded since 2015 for refusing to say yes or no. His pacifist stance probably helped give “the button” an even bigger platform during the election campaign. And now it is becoming a motif of the Labour leadership contest, with Rebecca Long Bailey being asked the same question on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday morning.The amount of attention given to the prospect of a hypothetical nuclear war seems grossly out of proportion, especially compared to the existential threat we are actually facing: the climate emergency. Labour’s Green New Deal policy, which Long Bailey helped write, was a central theme of her pitch for leader. Yet in the same radio interview she wasn’t asked about it once.The Conservatives mentioned the climate crisis just 10 times in their manifesto. They have no convincing strategy for reducing carbon emissions at the speed required to avert disaster. So, outside of the left, where is the debate? Where is the outrage? Where is the fear?This week social media was flooded with pictures of near-apocalyptic scenes of scorched koala bodies and houses engulfed in flames as images of the fires in Australia spread around the world. Meanwhile, one columnist fumed on Twitter about an environmentally friendly vegan meal served at the Golden Globes. Frankly, we ran out of time for this type of silliness long ago.Global heating is a clearer and more present danger than Britain becoming embroiled in nuclear war. But the latter offers a misleadingly simple scenario: one action is required, and no thought given as to what might come next (pushing the button would be the start of a nuclear war, not the end). The climate crisis, in contrast, is unavoidably messy, requiring a radical overhaul of every system, everything we buy, everything we eat. I can imagine why some would prefer not to think about it.Boris Johnson decided not to bother attending Channel 4’s Climate Debate during the election campaign, and was represented by an ice sculpture instead. In absenting himself, the prime minister effectively announced that, when it comes to the climate crisis, he will not push the button. As that existential threat draws nearer, he will sit back and take no action. But relax: at least he has confirmed he’s willing to save us all by starting a nuclear war.• Rachel Connolly writes about technology, cultural trends and politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c2c9373339e00c57738f4d79e520be7580f1c1/0_194_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b6b90b5ec32916daa89426219e405a0","title":"golden globes after parties in pictures","story":"Winners and nominees celebrate after the awards at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae65679f540462bcb7b13dc8e2e3728b96aff439/0_341_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757bd4f386da68d2a188852fcb813a91","title":"how make gluten free muffins taste good","story":"Beat the flour for longer, add xanthan gum, use less butter and more egg – making a decent, gluten-free cupcake or muffin is a cinch once you know howBoth my young grandchildren have been recently diagnosed as gluten-intolerant. I’ve always baked them cupcakes and muffins as treats, so now have to go back to the drawing board, but the amount of advice out there is bewildering. Help!Sue, St AlbansWhen it comes to cakes of any sort, it’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that gluten-free has to mean a bit “meh” and dry. That’s mainly because many of us – especially those who don’t get adverse reactions to gluten – still believe that gluten-free flour has more in common with sawdust than with regular flour.Nothing could be further from the truth, says cupcake queen Jemma Wilson, who owns the Crumbs \u0026amp Doilies bakery in central London. “For things like cupcakes, sponge cakes and muffins, it’s actually very straightforward to make a decent, gluten-free version that bears a remarkable resemblance to the so-called ‘real thing’,” explains Wilson, who as a sideline also runs her own YouTube channel, Cupcake Jemma, which has more than 1.6m subscribers. Who knew that diddy little cupcakes were that popular?Wilson swears by Doves Farm’s gluten-free self-raising and plain flours and, crucially, uses them in the exact same quantities as you would in the original non-gluten-free recipe. This has the handy side-effect of negating one of all gluten-free bakers’ big bugbears: adjusting the proportions when converting measurements for gluten-free flour from regular flour without having to use a bespoke gluten-free recipe. Wilson does give her cake a helping hand, though: “To give it a lift, we beat the flour in for longer. There’s no danger of the sponge ending up tough, because the flour would have to have gluten in it for that to happen.”To give her gluten-free cakes a little extra bounce and spring, so they more closely resemble regular cakes, Wilson also adds a stabiliser that will already be familiar to any gluten-free baker: xanthan gum. This helps bind the dough and create a stronger crumb structure, but use only a teeny pinch, she warns: “If you overdo it, the end product will be rubbery.” As a basic rule of thumb, Wilson says an eighth of a teaspoon per dozen cupcakes or muffins, and a quarter-teaspoon for a 15cm layer cake, should be more than enough to be going on with.More broadly speaking, there are other avenues for Sue to explore in looking to free her go-to recipes from gluten. According to all-round baking Yoda (and former  columnist) Dan Lepard, by far the best strategy with gluten-free flour is to use less butter and more egg, together with ground nuts and other good-quality flavourings. “Fats inhibit starch particles from bonding when they’re heated, in much the same way as risotto rice that’s first been cooked in butter stays al dente,” explains Lepard. And if you’re worried that a reduced butter content means the cake will lose some of its richness, you can always just add more to the frosting, he says.“Gluten-free flour mixes are more or less blank flavour powders that need help to bind and taste good,” he adds. “While egg white is great at holding mixtures together, and pretty much essential when there’s no gluten, it’s also flavourless and a bit solid, so tweak the recipe to boost the flavour and texture.” In these circumstances, he says, ground almonds and top-notch vanilla are your best friends. Mind you, the same goes for pretty much all sweet baking, really."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa4e5592ca8264a8d7bd719801c278ca23b46251/0_635_3840_2303/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8678d0ea550c6786c6072fd059f3ddc7","title":"weve always been honest about our weight loss the pinch of nom chefs on their recipe for success","story":"From posting healthy meal ideas on Facebook and running a restaurant, Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson went on to write bestselling slimming books that grew out of their own efforts to lose weight – and started a global phenomenonKay Featherstone and Kate Allinson were at a Spice Girls concert last spring, just two figures in a sea of people. As they gazed around the stadium, Kay broke down in tears. Not because of anything the Spice Girls were singing, but because the two chefs were consumed by the thought of their own followers they have more than 900,000 on Facebook. “When we go to a gig, it’s like: ‘We could fill this space so many times!’ It becomes very, very scary,” Featherstone says.They got the same feeling at Fleetwood Mac. Featherstone has sweaty palms just thinking about it. She and Allinson, who are business as well as life partners, try to “forget the noughts” and imagine a community of 900, but it’s still a long way from the days when they had their own restaurant with customers who came in every Sunday and even brought the pair presents if they went on a cruise.No wonder Allinson, 48, and Featherstone, 34, sound bewildered, if not downright terrified. Their success as the chef duo Pinch of Nom has been sudden. Last spring, their first book of simple slimming recipes sold 500,000 copies in just five weeks (and recently passed the 1m mark). Last month’s follow-up, Everyday Light, sold nearly 130,000 in its first week, knocking David Walliams from the top of the bestseller list.“It has been a little bit crazy,” Featherstone whispers, as if danger lurks nearby. They have had offers for TV shows – “offers for everything” – but have declined them all because they are “really shy”, says Featherstone, although she is “the gobbier half because Kate doesn’t usually like to talk”. (“That’s fair,” says Allinson, whose T-shirt is emblazoned with the slogan: “Introverts unite – separately in your own homes”.) When I ask if they might choose to meet their followers – I’m thinking of events – they say that they did bump into some once, and you can’t say it won’t happen again. “But it has never been about us,” Featherstone says, and Allinson, a sort of quiet chorus, echoes her words. “It’s never been about us.”This is something of a mantra for Featherstone and Allinson, and I’m intrigued by their wish to deny they are protagonists in their own enterprise. After all, many of their recipes are autobiographical. “Tin of praters”, a bacon, potato and onion bake, is lifted straight from Featherstone’s childhood, while the entire Pinch of Nom adventure took off when the two went along to their local Slimming World in Wirral four years ago, then began to post their own recipes to a growing Facebook community.Their personal story is at the heart of their business – but so is their disavowal of it. “We don’t spout about ourselves. We’re not that sort,” Featherstone says. They don’t take selfies even on their first date, the only picture they took was of a gull. Photographs of them are rare.In newspaper articles, Allinson and Featherstone are often described as “two fat chefs”. They laugh uproariously when I point this out. “Do you know we have a little list of the things we have been described as?” Featherstone says. “Fat. Middle-aged. Jolly.” Allinson chuckles. “We found it really funny,” Featherstone says. Then the tone abruptly shifts.“Sadly, it is the way that some people talk about people of our size. ‘Fat’ is a word that people will use willy-nilly to describe people of size. And I personally hate it,” Featherstone says. “It makes me angry deep inside …”In March, the pair revealed they were aiming to lose 190kg (30 stone) between them. Featherstone had so far lost 44kg and Allinson 31kg. I’m curious as to how they vied up the target. Featherstone says: “We came up with that between us.” They didn’t figure out how much each wanted to lose? “We’ve never really had a target,” Allinson says. “Because I think that can put a lot of pressure on.”“And we don’t do pressure,” Featherstone adds. But surely two books in the space of a year put pressure on them? “We don’t intentionally put pressure on ourselves,” Allinson says. “Is a better way of putting it,” Featherstone nods.I’m curious to know if they have lost more weight since the first book, but Featherstone says that the numbers are still what they were.The body of any diet author will always be taken as a measure of success. Is that on their mind? “It can’t not be,” Featherstone says. “We think about things a lot. It’s why we’re both so anxious all the time … We still struggle. Even now. We kind of fluctuate. We have a steady loss.” And while fluctuation and steadiness may seem at odds with each other, no doubt those who are sharing their weight loss “journey” will relate to the apparent contradiction.“We’ve always been really honest and open about it,” Allinson says.They have had an intense and challenging year, adjusting not just to huge public interest, but also to the loss of Allinson’s mum. Or, as Featherstone puts it: “We’ve had a great year, but we’ve also had a shit year.” Allinson’s mother died in January, the day after the couple told her they were going to publish a book. When Allinson says this, her eyes are wet and shiny.“Has anyone got a tissue?” Featherstone interjects. I assume she is asking for Allinson, but she quickly adds: “Because I’m wearing mascara and I know what’s going to happen.” Allinson fishes in her bag and passes her one. They happily rattle off their differences – Allinson is organised, decisive and likes strong tea Featherstone is disorganised, indecisive, talkative and takes her tea milky. But the two of them seem to understand and meet each other’s needs.They met nearly 15 years ago, having seen each other’s profiles on Gaydar Girls. “But I didn’t message you for ages,” Featherstone says. When they met, they got in the car and ended up in Rhyl, north Wales.Within six months, Featherstone had moved into Allinson’s family home in New Brighton, Wallasey, where the pair still live with Allinson’s older sister, Lisa, and her dad (whom the three of them look after) as well as two cats. “I’ve been in the same house for … how long is it? Forty-five years,” Allinson says. Before this one, she lived in the house over the back, which was her nan’s B\u0026ampB. I am trying to picture how the house – “just an old Victorian one”, Allinson says – must have felt with five adults in it. When they met, Allinson ran her own restaurant, Cromwells, in nearby Irby. Featherstone quickly took on front of house. Food was the driver of their relationship, and they went into work even when the restaurant was closed. “I washed the pots. I wanted to learn how this whole thing worked.” In their downtime, they watched, among other things, Two Fat Ladies (they have the DVDs) and ate lots of Chinese takeaways.While Allinson had been to catering college and had gone on to be the head chef for the Boddingtons chain, Featherstone had left school at 16. She had helped a bit in her parents’ florist shop and did voiceovers at a radio station in Liverpool, but food – and Allinson – provided a place that felt like home.The restaurant was hard work. Things came to a head when Allinson’s mum, who did the accounts, had a brain haemorrhage. Within a few months, the restaurant closed, as they focused on caring for her. “We grieved for the restaurant,” Featherstone says. “It hit us hard.” Next they worked for a Canadian IT company which, if I’ve understood correctly, speeds up the internet by using datacentres on the edge of the cloud. It sounds an unlikely fit, but both women say they wanted nothing to do with food after the restaurant shut. In between were months where “we didn’t do a whole bunch of much”.Then, in January 2016, Lisa persuaded them to go to Slimming World. They began to create the dishes that went into the first book in the “tiny” family kitchen that, they say, is smaller than the toilet in the offices of their London publisher, where we are meeting.They photographed their food at the dining room table. It must have been a squeeze, but Allinson’s mum said: “If you want to do it, do it well.” Allinson’s dad lost a stone unintentionally just by eating their food. Then at Slimming World one week, they heard another person discussing a Pinch of Nom recipe and realised how far they had come. At that point, no one in the group knew who they were.Now they have a test kitchen, a team of 11 and an army of followers they are scared to think about. Featherstone, Allinson and their family all eat the food they make. “When people are trying to diet, and the rest of the family don’t need to, it can feel as if you’re on your own,” Featherstone says. She knows this from personal experience. At her all-girls’ school, she was “the tall one and the big one” and dieted to fit in, but was bullied. “The experience of being different hardened me,” she says. But I suspect this hardening is a work-in-progress.I am surprised, when I get home, and reread the articles that describe Allinson and Featherstone as “two fat chefs”, to see that the person who chose those words was none other than Featherstone herself. I email her to ask why, given how the description angers her, and she replies that “it was a way of saying it first … It’s an ownership thing.

The 19-year-old is highly regarded at Anfield but has found first-team opportunities hard to come by as Liverpool’s established attackers continue to shine.Brewster, who came through the youth ranks at Chelsea before moving north, made his first Liverpool appearance in the Carabao Cup third-round win at MK Dons earlier this season and then scored a penalty in the shootout victory against Arsenal in the following round. He most recently came on 11 minutes from the end of Sunday’s FA Cup win against Everton.The England Under-21 international holds a Champions League winners’ medal having been an unused substitute in the 2-0 win over Tottenham in last season’s final.He will now link up once again with Steve Cooper, the Swansea manager, who was in charge of the England side that won the 2017 Under-17s World Cup – a tournament in which Brewster won the golden boot for the top goalscorer.Swansea confirmed Brewster would be available for Sunday’s derby clash with Cardiff as he looks to help guide the club back into the Premier League.“I’ve come here to try and play a lot of games and score a lot of goals for Swansea,” Brewster told City’s website. “It’s a great club. I’ve been watching them for ages – particularly when they were in the Premier League.“Hopefully I can help them get back to where they belong. At this moment in time Swansea is the best team for me to join on loan. I want to help Swansea get promoted.”Elsewhere in the Championship Fulham have completed the permanent signing of the winger Ivan Cavaleiro from Wolves. Cavaleiro, 26, who joined Fulham on a season-long loan in July, has agreed a four-and-a-half-year contract.The Cottagers said on their official website: “The club is pleased to confirm that the permanent registration of Ivan Cavaleiro as a Fulham player has been completed. Cavaleiro will remain at Craven Cottage until the summer of 2024, with a club option to extend the deal by a further year.”The Portuguese has scored five goals and registered six assists in 23 Championship appearances for Scott Parker’s side this season.

Having finished as runner-up to the Egypt forward for the last two years, Mané becomes the second Senegalese to win the award after another Liverpool player, El Hadji-Diouf, in 2001 and 2002.“To be honest I would prefer to be playing football than speaking in front of so many people,” said Mané. “I’m really happy and really proud at the same time. I would like to thank my family, especially my uncle who is here today. It is a big day for me and I would love to thank all the Senegalese people who have been voting for me. I’m from a very small village called Bambali and I’m sure they are all watching me tonight.”Oshoala, who scored in Barcelona’s Champions League final defeat to Lyon, was also delighted to be recognised.“Grateful to be African Women’s Player of the year for the 4th time,” she wrote on Twitter. “Thank God, my Family, Friends and Fans for the support. Big shoutout to my club , my management , team mates at both national team and club level and of course thanks to @CAF_Online for the opportunity.”Algeria were named as men’s team of the year, with Djamel Belmadi picking up the coaching award.

He’s clearly not enamoured with their drop-off in intensity during this second half.74 min: United back off De Bruyne as he drives down the left. They’re fortunate that the City playmaker gets the ball stuck a little under his feet before he can shoot, and then plays an uncharacteristically sloppy pass inside. The hosts clear.73 min: A yellow card for Williams, who barges into the back of Mahrez with unnecessary force.71 min: Well that’s got Old Trafford singing again. Sterling does his level best to quieten them down by tearing down the inside left and into the box, but he dallies over a shot and is forced to clip back for Mahrez, who clumps softly into the arms of De Gea.City nearly had a four-goal lead now it’s just two! De Bruyne and Rodri get careless in midfield. Greenwood strides down the middle before slipping a ball down the inside-right channel for Rashford, who takes a silky touch, strides into the box, and lashes a fine shot across Bravo and into the bottom left!69 min: Mahrez drops a shoulder to drift past Williams yet again, then slams a shot towards the bottom-left corner. De Gea sticks out a strong leg to save.68 min: Williams bombs down the inside-left channel, a maverick run that nearly opens City up. Nearly, but not quite.66 min: Mahrez sends Walker into acres down the right, Williams way out of position. Walker’s cross hits Jones on the hand, but from the sort of range that’s never leading to a penalty kick.64 min:  Rashford looks for the top-right corner of the goal. He finds the top-right corner of the Stretford End. Then United make their second change, replacing James with Angel Gomes.63 min: Rodri is booked for a cynical clip on Pereira, who is skedaddling down the inside-right channel after a clever Lindelof pass. A free kick in Rashford Country.61 min: Sterling breaks upfield as United throw men forward. He slips the ball left for Silva, who knocks it back infield for De Bruyne. De Bruyne takes a shot. It’s deflected off Matic, and breaks to Sterling, who is clear, only to fall over. He wants a penalty, but he’s not getting one. United living dangerously. Like that’s breaking news. 59 min: Mahrez briefly has an opportunity to slip Sterling clean through on goal, but fails to spot the run in time. United go up the other end, James chasing a long ball down the right. Bravo claims easily. James takes the opportunity to go shoulder to shoulder with Otamendi, barging his man over again. This developing battle’s worth keeping an eye on.57 min: United spend a little bit of time in City’s final third. City are happy to sit back, leaving no gaps. United can’t work out a way through. James eventually clatters Otamendi, knee to knee. It’s no more than a foul, though VAR sticks its neb in, looking for trouble that isn’t there.55 min: Mahrez tries to keep a loose ball in play down the right. Williams comes sliding in at 100mph. He’s fortunate not to make contact with Mahrez, because that was reckless. Mahrez does him a favour by leaping out of the way and giving up the goal kick. Williams has looked impressive on the front foot he’s been a bit shaky in defence.54 min: Williams clanks a clearance straight into Walker, who immediately feeds Mahrez down the right. Williams does well to get back and limit the damage to a corner. Mahrez takes. United half clear. Mendy loops the ball back to Mahrez, who chests down, facing a very tight angle on the right. His low shot clatters the post and goes out for a goal kick. Had it been on target, De Gea had it well covered.52 min: Fred is booked for an obvious clip on Bernardo Silva’s heel. He gives referee Mike Dean what for. He’d do well to keep his counsel. The last thing United need is to go down to ten men.51 min: Greenwood and James combine neatly down the inside-right channel, but just as the move begins to look promising, James runs the ball out for a goal kick.50 min: De Bruyne dances down the left and pulls one back through a thicket for Sterling, who can’t sort his feet out on the edge of the box. For a split second, Old Trafford held its breath. The pensive sucking of teeth was also audible.49 min: All a bit scrappy since the restart. A few defiant chants from the home faithful. Nothing much else to report. United will appreciate the respite.47 min: Pereira slips a decent ball down the left for Rashford, who checks back and finds Fred. A few rat-a-tat passes on the edge of the box, and finally Williams sends a pea-roller towards the bottom left. Bravo gathers.United get the second half underway. They’ll be looking to reboot just like Arsenal did last night in the FA Cup after being outplayed in the first 45 by Leeds. Problem is, of course, as good as Leeds are, they’re no Manchester City ... and Arsenal weren’t three goals down. Still, United need something, anything. Reaching this year’s League Cup final already looks to be a pipe dream, but they’ll be desperate for some sort of response. Or at least to not totally capitulate. To this end, Matic has been sent on for Lingard.City have been as breathtaking as United have been shocking. A few boos from the home crowd, but only a smattering. Nothing that sounds as though a revolt is on the cards. “Of all the players on the field, Sterling is the only one with any desire to make the scoreline look remotely respectable for United.” Naveen RS, a United supporter, with the gallows humour there.45 min: There will be one added minute. The next 60 seconds can’t go by quickly enough for Manchester United.44 min: Pereira has a dig from 25 yards. United need something, anything. But not this. The ball flies harmlessly over the bar, miles off target.43 min: For the second time, it’s nearly four, as De Bruyne whips a low ball across the face of goal from the right. Sterling will curse clipping his toenails last night, because he was a couple of millimetres away from poking home at the far post.42 min: It’s important to remember that City have been quite outstanding since the get-go. Few teams could live with their relentless attacking. But of course the normal rules of analysis never apply in derby matches.40 min: This is already embarrassing for United. It could get a whole lot worse. City win a corner out on the right. The ball’s worked all the way to Bernardo Silva on the left. He breaks clean through down the channel, and he’s one on one with De Gea. The keeper makes a sensational save, and it turns out Silva was offside anyway. United are in danger of totally capitulating.Another City break. Silva slips Mahrez away down the middle. Mahrez brushes past Williams with ease and slips the ball wide left to De Bruyne, who sits Jones down as he enters the area. De Bruyne looks to curl one into the bottom left. De Gea saves, only for the ball to pinball off Pereira six yards out and into the unguarded net.36 min: United nearly find some succour as Fred plays a fizzing pass down the inside-left channel for Lingard, who cushions the ball towards Greenwood. The young striker drags a shot well wide right. But that’s given a worried Old Trafford a little something to go on.35 min: A frustrated Lingard is shown the yellow card, sticking his studs up while chasing a heavy touch and catching Fernandinho. United need to clear their heads and quick, or this semi-final will get away from them very soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d97e880bb47d8037a63e27574adb1a41cfe5796/195_200_5408_3245/master/5408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eee0c2258b0b5cb958fb5147d6baa50d","title":"can sun simulator improve winter mood lethargy","story":"The sudden white blaze disorients me, like a cockroach caught in the kitchen. But will it make me feel better?Are you feeling depressed? Lethargic? Is it because every year our social, environmental and economic situation gets worse? Or is it because reduced daylight has negatively affected your circadian rhythm? If the latter, then I have good news! There’s a lamp for that.Vitamin L by Lumie is a powerful rectangular sun simulator that “treats the symptoms of winter blues and Sad”. Ah yes, seasonal affective disorder, setting the bar for sarcastic acronyms in the diagnostic field. (Provocative aside: the latest science finds depression to be a stable phenomenon, unrelated to seasons.) Still, we like the comfort of medical terms. Even the device’s name plays into this. Vitamin L? Come on, now. Vitamin Nice Try.Light therapy stimulates the retina, to suppress the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and increase levels of mood-boosting serotonin. And, lordy, that sounds good to me because another 12 months of this hot mess I cannot do. Vitamin L is slimline – roughly the size of a library reference book – portable and UV-free.I slot in the kickstand and set it on my desk at a 20cm distance to receive the full 10,000 lumens. This is important. At a 30cm distance, my retinas would only receive roughly half that, and at 40cm about half again, twice doubling the treatment time needed to feel any effect. Basically, you have to be intimate with the light. A friend owns a larger, older light box and takes it to bed with him. Whatever gets you through the night, I suppose.I give my own, compact Lumie the once-over, trying to find the button to turn it on. When I do, my face is right up next to the screen. The sudden white blaze disorients me. I am a cockroach caught in the kitchen. A prisoner halfway up a wall. I’m in the dentist’s chair.I recover my senses and try to adjust to the knockout field of photons. It feels stark and chilly. The experience reminds me of the time I changed my bedside lamp but didn’t realise I had bought a bulb that had too high a wattage. When I turned the light on, my boudoir resembled a chamber of extraordinary rendition.I use it for a week: 30 minutes in the morning, a top-up session a few hours later. During this time, the sky is always fifty shades of grey: dreich beyond belief. I come to appreciate the little window of energy. Particularly in the afternoons, when the light is extinguished before teatime, and I begin to feel less like I’m hugging a strip light in Bar Italia at 4am.I drink up the lumens and focus more on the panel itself, and its texture. The LEDs are covered with a “rippled diffuser” – a plastic face with a granular feel quilted into diagonal bands. It is rigid, but with the topography of a padded surface, which does soften the quality of the white light. Does it soften the understanding that humanity is walking towards a cliff-edge? Not really! It’s just a lamp. But still.It does keep me awake while it’s on. Yet it doesn’t feel natural to constantly sit right next to a bright light. It’s hardly a bay window on an August morning, where the light feels constant and enveloping, even as you move around.It wouldn’t be fair to criticise Lumie for failing to replicate the power of the sun. (Although it probably has before, in its sunrise alarm clocks, which are terrific.) But as soon as I turn Vitamin L off, the urge to sleep is still there. I can’t say my mood or lethargy have improved. It doesn’t work for me, this sitting next to a big lamp, although others swear by it.One morning during my trial, the sun emerges briefly from the blanket of grey, like a David Bowie cameo in Zoolander, reminding me what radiance looks like. The sun engulfs Lumie’s light, warms my blood and makes the room come alive. It’s good to remember that she is always up there, even when we can’t see her when the forecast is bad, the clouds endless. Shining bright as ever, forcing everything to grow and live. The days are getting longer. Everything’s not lost.Why not just call it “nappers’ delight” or the “winterval boo-hoos”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfaf760ec878247a3af49c97fd61a9792e68d8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87477c5c73f628d3939dddf990d80a03","title":"tell us about outstanding customer service you received","story":"We want to hear from people who have received exceptional customer serviceAfter the Christmas spending flurry come the tales of corporate ill will, with botched delivery dates, faulty goods and customer service departments who don’t seem to listen or care.At this time of year, ’s consumer inboxes are congested with high street horror stories.Invisible in the background, some firms are going beyond the call of duty to fulfil orders and resolve issues.Often independent companies and occasionally big chains, handle complaints with care and respect, creating a better impression of themselves in the minds of their customers.We want to hear from people who have been bowled over by exceptional service, to show that corporate Britain can sometimes get it right.Has a trader driven through the night to ensure your goods reach you in time or soothed a situation with imaginative aplomb?Tell us about your experiences in the form below – one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further and we’ll publish a selection as part of an upcoming feature.If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

By the time the series, produced by the activist dream hampton, aired on Lifetime last January, the allegations against R Kelly had long been public, and mounting. But it took a six-hour television event to do what multiple public lawsuits, highly publicized child sexual abuse images and a trial, a widely circulated tape involving sexual acts with a 14-year-old, a bombshell BuzzFeed News article by the reporter Jim DeRogatis, and the #MuteRKelly movement were not able to do: heat simmering public discomfort – or, worse, willful blindness – over the singer’s conduct into a full boil.As documented in Surviving R Kelly Part II: The Reckoning, the follow-up that aired on Lifetime this weekend, the first series landed in a #MeToo media environment with a bang, producing a long-overdue blast of attention on Kelly with legal repercussions. Celebrities from Christina Aguilera to Lady Gaga publicly commended the series, while calls for finally muting Kelly’s music skyrocketed his label, RCA, dropped him, cutting off crucial revenue. Kim Foxx, the state’s attorney for Kelly’s hometown of Chicago, made a public plea for victims to come forward with information to aid a prosecutorial effort six weeks after the series aired, Kelly was indicted for 10 counts of sexual abuse. Eighteen federal charges, including for kidnapping, forced labor and sending child sexual abuse images across state lines, followed in August.All these developments could make it seem as though the long-running case against Kelly achieved, forthcoming trials aside, some sort of resolution. But Surviving R Kelly Part II illustrates with, as in the first series, haunting and minimally staged interviews that compiling stories of Kelly’s abuse on camera was hardly the end. In fact, it’s only the beginning of a different struggle: of moving on, or finding justice, or weathering vicious backlash. The five-hour series, again aided by numerous cultural commentators, activists, psychological experts and music industry professionals, builds on the questions that have been asked in post-#MeToo discourse in 2019, now two years removed from the reporting on Harvey Weinstein that launched an outpouring of public stories of abuse: was it worth it? Was coming forward worth the social media harassment, the public scrutiny? Especially against a public figure, especially as black women coming against a celebrity as big as Kelly? What culture of complicity allowed this to go on so long? And now that Kelly is in custody, what does justice look like?The first two episodes deal with the series in its own media context: a viral hit which inspired a serious reckoning but also furious doubt and resistance. The dozens of women who came forward in the first series, or told their stories on television, in their own words, for the first time, “have continuously been put on trial themselves”, says the activist Brittany Packnett Cunningham. The vitriol online has followed, as the series describes, a typical script of victim-blaming: what were they wearing? Why put themselves in that situation? What were their parents thinking?Part II reveals some of the toll this backlash had on Kelly’s accusers, and how the resources and fear tactics of a celebrity at his level go into hyperdrive as one’s visibility rises. There’s shocking footage of the first series’s premiere in New York, which was evacuated over a threat of violence in the chaos afterwards at the hotel, a representative from Kelly’s team allegedly threatened one participant in the show, Faith Rodgers, with posting nude photos online as punishment for speaking publicly. It ultimately didn’t matter after the show aired, vigilante pages supporting Kelly popped up – one particularly vile one endeavored to discredit the women one by one with public shaming, mugshots and leaked photos, including ones of Rodgers.The pressure since the show aired has been relentless, according to many who spoke in the first series. Another accuser, Asante McGee, says that in 2019, she just wanted to sleep everything away. Kelly may have been arrested, but after the air date, “I felt like nothing,” Rodgers says. “I wasn’t known as Faith anymore. I’m known as the girl who slept with R Kelly.”“This is not about women finding our voices – we have always had our voices,” says Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement, in the series. “This is about people’s ability to hear. We’ve just finally found a frequency that people can hear us.”Women have been using their voices to speak up against Kelly for over two decades – though, as Part II points out, the legal system has frequently made it difficult to do so. As with Ronan Farrow’s Catch and Kill and Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey’s She Said, two recent books dissecting the Weinstein reporting, Part II examines how settlements and their attendant non-disclosure agreements became essential tools in protecting abusers.Two women, Tiffany Hawkins and Lanita Carter, illustrate the pain of enforced silence in heartbreaking detail. Hawkins, the first woman to accuse Kelly of sexual abuse in a lawsuit, in 1996, met Kelly as a latchkey 15-year-old in 1991 she quickly became what he called his “cable girl” – she hooked him up with several of her 15-year-old friends before Kelly turned their relationship sexual. Carter was his hair braider in the early 2000s and, like Hawkins, felt close to Kelly as his anointed “little sister”. When he assaulted her, she called the police, seeking criminal charges.Both women’s stories and eventual lawsuits were, they remember, largely ignored by authorities at the time both ended up settling and signing non-disclosure agreements with a Chicago-based lawyer who, according to DeRogatis, brokered probably a dozen NDA-laced settlements for Kelly, amounting to what he called a “settlement factory”.There’s the factory of silence, but also an unwillingness to listen, or to threaten the cash cow of Kelly’s stardom by confronting his behavior – not after Hawkins’s lawsuit, or Kelly’s marriage to his then 15-year-old protege Aaliyah, or when a tape showing Kelly urinating on a 14-year-old girl resulted in charges for child sexual abuse images. One former sound engineer who worked with Kelly as he awaited trial for his case, in which he was acquitted in 2008, remembers delivering a 21st birthday cake to the girl in the tape, who was still living in Kelly’s garage at the time. He was aware of girls living in the house but “we weren’t supposed to talk to them, they weren’t supposed to talk to us”, he recalled, though the mood around recording music was unchanged.The final two episodes focus on moving forward after the endpoint of the first series – what happened to the girls still under Kelly’s control at the time the first series aired, and what does justice look like for a cast of victims numbering, according to DeRogatis, at least 48 women? Part II checks in with Dominique Gardner, whose mother whisked her from Kelly’s orbit in 2018, and on the families of Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary, two aspiring singers who both met Kelly when they were 17 and who defended the singer in his interview with Gayle King last March. In devastating detail, the Savage and Clary families rebut the stereotypes and hate thrown at them for years by Kelly’s defenders and explain how the singer manipulated their daughters against them. Both families, at the time of filming in 2019, hadn’t seen their daughters in three or four years.Their testimony demonstrates the consequences of an unchecked, well-resourced Kelly. Even as the documentary aired last year, Kelly’s tactics of manipulation – turning the women against their parents, cutting off communication, controlling their whereabouts – continued to wreak havoc on their families. Clary, according to the epilogue, left Kelly’s circle in December but is still supporting him as he prepares for trial. Savage, as of the show’s air date, remained isolated from her family.Kelly awaits his first trial in April, but for viewers the question of justice, and the continuing negotiation over whether to separate the art from the artist, are immediate. As with the fallout from HBO’s Finding Neverland’s claims of abuse by Michael Jackson, there’s an urgency over how to listen when people say, according to DeRogatis, to “be aware of the context. Be aware of what he’s really saying in that canon of music. Be aware of the pain he caused to people.”“After the first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, we could’ve said, ‘No more.’ But then there was the sixth, the seventh, the eighth – we could’ve stopped it then,” says Oronike Odeleye, co-founder of the #MuteRKelly movement. “Then there’s the ninth, the 10th, the 11th. This has been going on for close to 30 years now because of silence.” Surviving R Kelly Part II: The Reckoning argues that there’s still more story to tell, and still an obligation to listen – though hopefully we can finally say: no more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52463ecfee14434bcd49d3ee116eaee9ca82221d/0_611_1181_708/master/1181.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=db1a283104a8e0216ce55165dc90f6e0 1400w","title":"assassination of qassem suleimani podcast","story":"The US drone strike on Iran’s most influential general could transform the Middle East.

Parliament has returned and you’re going to have to say something about the US wet job on Qassem Suleimani and the Australian bushfires.”“What bushfires?” Boris moaned, tugging at his hair.Classic Dom sighed. The prime minister was in even worse shape than he had imagined. Best to keep things simple. In his current state, Boris could not be trusted not to screw things up by making a Commons statement that didn’t either end up condoning the American hit job or screw up any chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.What was needed was someone who was too dim to realise he had been thrown under a bus by being forced to defend the indefensible while simultaneously trying to maintain an air of feigned detachment. Under ordinary circumstances Dominic Raab would have been the ideal choice, but now was not the time to send out an angry psychopath who would have happily volunteered to fire the drone himself.It would have to be the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, then. The cabinet’s very own Captain Darling. A man of so many limitations, he has yet to register double figures on any IQ scale. A man with the virtue of mindless loyalty who would regard being used as collateral damage as the highest honour that could be bestowed on him. Darling Darling.So just after 3.30pm, Wallace found himself on his feet reading out a statement that would have amounted to his own death warrant in the previous parliament, but now barely raised an eyebrow. With an 80-seat majority, the Tories have licence to pretty much do what they want. We are in a brave new world where the idiots have full licence to be idiots. The People’s Idiots.Darling Darling does have the ideal voice for such a suicide mission. A dull, entitled monotone that makes every listener forget the beginning of a sentence long before it has been brought to a close. Suleimani had been a bad man, so he’d probably had it coming. And the Americans had said he was going to do more bad things and he saw no reason not to disbelieve them even though they hadn’t been able to offer any evidence to that effect. So when you came to think about it, the US had actually displayed superhuman self-restraint by not whacking him sooner.But the UK was keen that the killing should not escalate into a third world war, and the prime minister had done his best to operate cocktail diplomacy from Mustique once the US had supplied him with the Sky News footage of the aftermath of the drone strike. In fact, Boris had gone the extra mile by WhatsApping a few world leaders to find out what the fuck was going on and he was now urging the Iranians to avert a crisis by acting with more restraint than the US. So sweet. Darling Darling didn’t even realise he’d effectively called the US a rogue state.The Labour benches were almost empty for Jeremy Corbyn’s reply. It was sod’s law that the one time the Labour leader had a decent case to make, both about the dangers posed by President Trump and the UK’s dependence on him, it had come when he was a political irrelevance. He briefly stated the obvious – that going around assassinating world leaders was a dangerous precedent – before sitting down to near silence. Apart from a few jeers from Tories who appeared keen on the idea of mobile death squads taking out anyone they fancied.Jeremy Hunt was also fully deranged. He’s clearly bitterly regretting once having had enough principle to refuse a job in Boris’s cabinet and is now desperate to get reinstated. He had always loved the Donald and was fed up with people maligning him. All that had happened was that the president had got a little bit narked that some Nato countries were not pulling their weight and had wanted to teach them a lesson about what might happen if they didn’t get their act together. Now was the time to remind countries of their financial obligations to Nato rather than giving the US a hard time about one little killing.Darling Darling trundled on obliviously. Everyone could be forgiven one extrajudicial murder. It just mustn’t be allowed to become a habit. And though the killing might not have been legal under UK law, the US were noticeably much more relaxed about homicide and we should respect their traditions. Each to their own and all that. On the whole he would draw the line at the UK condoning war crimes, but each case would have to be considered on its own merits.On the plus side it was only 7 January and Wallace knew his year couldn’t get any worse. Over in Downing Street, Boris was fairly certain that his year had already peaked. Running the People’s government was a piece of piss when all you had to do was remain resolutely out of sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce3eed39140ae17743779c6be481dafadf483b81/0_43_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=198e6ec50522a6d09a8d823cc9de59b7","title":"scotland to introduce emergency measures as javid postpones budget","story":"The Scottish parliament is to introduce an emergency budget process, after the chancellor postponed the UK budget until mid-March.Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, said Sajid Javid’s decision to delay the UK’s budget until 11 March could have profound consequences for Scotland’s public services.He said that delay had forced the Scottish parliament to scrap its normal budget process, which involves two months of votes and negotiations between mid-December and mid-February.That includes setting Scotland’s separate income tax rates, worth nearly £12bn in spending, and the budgets for Scotland’s 32 local councils.Around £22bn of the Scottish government’s £34bn budget comes from the Treasury through the block grant. The Scottish Fiscal Commission, an independent advisory body, relies heavily on forecasts published by the Office for Budget Responsibility alongside each UK budget for its advice to Mackay on likely tax revenues and social security spending in the coming year.Scottish councils are legally required to set their budgets by 11 March, leading the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to warn on Tuesday that delays in confirming their grants could imperil public services.In an emergency statement at Holyrood, Mackay said Javid’s decision threatened the constitutional arrangements underpinning devolution. The Tories “will pay the price” for that disrespect, he said.“This is about respect to a nation this is about respect to a nation’s parliament and to a nation’s government,” he said.“This is about good governance and responsible fiscal policy. And this is about a degree of honour in the established relationships, protocols, custom and practice that we have that the UK government has totally disregarded.”Treasury officials said they had tried to help Scottish ministers plan ahead by giving them interim OBR forecasts on 20 December, knowing the election delayed the UK budget process. Scottish officials also knew the block grant would increase in April by £1.2bn, the Treasury said.Many parts of the public sector across the UK will be affected by Javid’s decision to delay his budget, although the Welsh government published its £20bn draft budget and income tax rates as normal on 16 December, despite the delay.Scottish civil servants have been working on contingency plans for setting Scotland’s budget since last December’s snap election was called, including exploring the options for emergency funding to help the public sector ensure they can pay for services and wage bills.Officials predicted the election would affect Holyrood’s normal budget process. Boris Johnson won Commons support for the snap election partly because the Scottish National party allied itself with the Liberal Democrats in backing it, pushing Labour into doing so too.A senior adviser to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, claimed on Tuesday that if Holyrood was unable to vote on a new Scottish income tax resolution before the start of the next financial year on 6 April, HM Revenue and Customs would be unable to collect them.The Chartered Institute of Taxation said that was highly unlikely. Joanne Walker, a spokeswoman for the institute, said that if Mackay failed to get a tax resolution passed in time, the Scotland Act empowered Westminster to authorise HMRC to continue collecting taxes at their current rate.Javid brushed aside complaints in the Commons from the SNP’s new Treasury spokeswoman, Alison Thewliss, about the delay. He said her party’s policies were the real issue. “Scotland has been let down time and time again by the SNP government, which is giving Scottish people the highest taxes in the United Kingdom and the worst set of public services,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b83556a979bc7e429a2514c2bb39d08bf464884/0_143_2866_1720/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0969795093e95b6f7e2668e15abf706","title":"astronomers discover huge gaseous wave holding milky ways newest stars","story":"‘It’s right up in our face’ – close proximity of stellar nursery to our solar system stuns scientists Astronomers have discovered a gigantic, undulating wave of dust and gas where newborn stars are forged over a 50 million billion mile stretch of the Milky Way.The gaseous structure, which holds more mass than 3m suns, runs directly behind our solar system as viewed from the heart of the galaxy, but has eluded observation until now.The spectacular string of stellar nurseries forms the largest known wave in the Milky Way and was announced, appropriately, at a scientific conference a stone’s throw from the surf mecca of Waikiki beach in Hawaii.“It is the largest gaseous structure we know about in the Milky Way,” said Alyssa Goodman, professor of applied astronomy at Harvard University, who presented the findings on Tuesday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu. “It’s right up in our face. It’s crazy that it’s so close by.”Measurements of the wave show that it stretches over 9,000 light years and makes up what is known as the “local arm” of the Milky Way. Looking down on the flat disc of the galaxy, the wave appears as a straight line about 400 light years wide. But from the side, it rises and falls 500 light years above and below the plane of the galaxy. For comparison, the width of the solar system is about half a light day – the distance light travels in 12 hours.The discovery has thrown up a raft of questions, not least around how the wave formed. One idea is that a much smaller galaxy clattered into that part of the Milky Way in the far-flung past, setting off ripples that spread like those from a stone tossed into a pond. A more exotic hypothesis sees a role for the mysterious dark matter that lurks unseen around galaxies.If the wave was set off by a cosmic collision, the ripples may pull the enormous dense clouds of dust and gas around for millions of years to come before finally settling down. “We think the wave is dynamic but the timescale of its motion up and down, we really don’t know,” said Goodman.The astronomers, including Catherine Zucker and João Alves, discovered the cosmic wave while mapping the distribution of vast clouds of dust and gas that pepper our galactic neighbourhood. Inside these dense clouds, gas can be compressed to such extremes that new stars are born.To map the positions of the clouds, the scientists relied on the fact that just as the sun reddens at sunset, so starlight reddens as it passes through interstellar dust. With this in mind, they analysed the colours of stars whose distances had been measured with unprecedented accuracy by Gaia, the European Space Agency’s (Esa) spacecraft. The dust reddens the light of stars behind it, but has no effect on those in front.Writing in the journal Nature the astronomers describe how the map revealed the shape of the giant wave of connected clouds. While earlier studies had suggested a huge ring of stellar nurseries around the solar system known as Gould’s Belt , the new map shows there is no ring, but a massive wave instead.“It’s been a puzzle for decades as to why so many of our local Gould’s Belt star-forming regions lie so far out of the galactic plane,” said Jennifer Hatchell, an astrophysicist at Exeter University who was not involved in the study. “The previous expanding-ring model fitted cloud positions and velocities well but never entirely explained the fragmentary structure, rotation or the origin of the ring, which required the energetic equivalent of several supernovae.“This alternative linear structure is just the sort of insight we hoped would come out of Esa’s Gaia dataset, and the team deserve credit for their excellent analysis and visualisation work. It will be interesting to see how this develops as explanations are proposed for its origin and relationship to the galactic spiral arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d37c6d399c43036fb99c1db5df10e6fac9e5616/327_591_3806_2285/master/3806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1eb3cb364959e98e8349b4effa1e5a3","title":"ben stokes dedicates england win to father south africa","story":"Ben Stokes has dedicated his match-winning performance in the second Test against South Africa to his stricken father, who kept tabs on England’s series-levelling victory from his hospital bed in Johannesburg.An emotional Stokes spoke after his three wickets in the final session led Joe Root’s team to a 189-run win in Cape Town. The all-rounder’s tour has been overshadowed by the illness to his father, Ged, who was admitted to intensive care two days before Christmas but has since been stabilised.Stokes won the man-of-the-match award, having made the decisive contribution with the ball after taking a record-equalling five catches in South Africa’s first innings and then scoring 72 from 47 balls to set up England’s declaration on day four at Newlands.However, the illness to his father, a former rugby league player and coach who lives in his native New Zealand, has kept things in perspective. “This year can only really go downhill from here after that,” said Stokes. “I’ve had a few knee issues and stuff like that, but this game here I’ve got the three lions on my chest which is such a proud thing to be standing on a field doing.“But I always had my dad in the back of my mind and that took any injury worries or niggles out of my head. I was thinking that he came out here to watch me and unfortunately he’s not been able to, so there was a lot more in my efforts this game, doing it for him. I haven’t managed to speak to him yet but hopefully I’ve made him proud. I had a text off Mum but I haven’t read it yet.”During the final session Stokes told Joe Root, England’s captain, he would not be taken out of the attack until he had won his team the game. A spell of three for one in 2.2 overs saw that happen and the 28-year-old admitted: “The more experienced you get, the more understanding of games you have. I said: ‘You’re not getting the ball out of my hand here until this day is done.’ It was one last push for this Test match. We have a few days off here so whether that game went a bit longer, I was running in and trying to put everything into every ball.”Stokes celebrated with a hand gesture in which he bends his middle finger forward so the tip cannot be seen, a reference to his father having to have part of that finger amputated after continuing to play when suffering an injury during his rugby league career in the 1980s.The dismissals of Dwaine Pretorius, Anrich Nortje and Vernon Philander sealed victory for England deep into the last session and Stokes said the drama of the final day was a strong enough argument as to why Test matches should remain of five days’ duration.The International Cricket Council has floated the idea of introducing mandatory four-day Tests from 2023, a concept the England \u0026amp Wales Cricket Board has “cautiously welcomed”. But Stokes had added his voice to those against the idea, following on from Indian icons Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar. “I think people are saying it because a few matches peter out into a boring draw,” he said. “That takes away games like this, which must be awesome as a spectator to be living through the emotions. But being a player on the field, going through the highs and lows of what Test cricket can do to you on a day-to-day basis is just awesome. Test cricket is not made for four days. It’s made for five. It’s called Test cricket for a reason. Change it to Easy cricket if they make it four days.”Though Stokes was named man of the match, he was insistent the award should have gone to his teammate Dom Sibley, the opener who batted for more than eight hours to compile his maiden Test hundred and produced an innings that set up England’s victory charge.Sibley refused to join Stokes during the post-match interviews after England’s vice-captain attempted to cajole him up to the stage with him. But he has since given Sibley the trophy. “So we are sitting next to each other in the dressing room and I walked in, gave it to him and he put it in my place,” said Stokes. “I went ‘no’ and put it in his bag. I walked back in and it was back in my bag. I said: ‘You’ve shafted me once by making me do the interviews, if it ends up back in my spot we are never sitting next to each other again.’ He has got it now.”As for how it feels to be the man who consistently gets England over the line in tight situations, Stokes added: “It’s an amazing thing to be a part of with adrenaline. Cricket is a team sport, it’s always a team effort and is never down to one inidual. Everyone at some point has put their hand up and done something in the crucial moments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d88cbd2362023f3486283dd54ce7a994f440ab9/0_159_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d5a7a78ad9668e59eb1f5808f36721e","title":"icc plan end five day tests best about cricket","story":"No. No. No. And also: no. Not even: no thanks. Not later or maybe or let’s see. This is simply a hard, flat no. And indeed an angry and reproachful no, too. When it comes to the ICC’s suggestion that four-day Test matches may be the future of international red-ball cricket there is only one sensible response. That response is an aggressive, concerted and righteous rejection.This is an informed no, too, a no that understands we live in a sporting world dominated by greed and short-termism (otherwise known as the commercial or “real” world). Change and compromise have been the dominant notes of cricket’s evolution over the last few years. A great many lines that shall never be crossed have already been cheerfully discarded, often with no harm done in the process.Four-day Tests might look like something similar from this distance. A bit of a do about nothing. Just another dimly felt note of contraction. How much easier simply to shrug and move on.Except this is something else entirely. The four-day Test goes to the heart of the most basic question facing this delicate, enduringly beautiful sport. Does cricket exist to make money or make money to exist? Make no mistake. The shift to a four-day game, driven purely by the lure of reducing expenditure, would end Test cricket in its current form. So much for all the talk. Here it is. The real death blow.Never mind the obvious point that snipping off the fifth day would automatically cancel the majority of great Test matches played to date, not to mention every single great Test draw (apologists will point to the possibility of the great four-day draw taking its place. Again: just no).Never mind the death of comparative statistics, the loss of Test cricket’s narrative strand, the heritage wastage. Above all snipping off the fifth day would end something intangible, the fine balance of tensions that distinguishes the five-day Test from all other forms of sport perhaps even all other forms of shared public activity.Need some proof? Cut to Cape Town and England’s gloriously hard-won victory in the second Test against South Africa. Sometimes sport has a way of telling you things. In the week that the ICC’s plans have been rejected – hearteningly – by Virat Kohli, when there is a sense of traction being sought for this act of pure sporting vandalism, cricket cleared its throat and dished up a five-day Test of brilliantly sustained and engrossing drama.This is not just about the final day. To get a proper feel for the value of Test cricket’s  it is necessary to look back down the timeline. To admire in particular Dom Sibley’s maiden Test hundred on days three and four, an innings that feels in its way like a slow-burn, perfectly timed two fingers to the basic idea of the four-day Test.Consider the sleek, adrenal beauty of that slow, crabby innings. Sibley took 411 minutes to get there. He played the ball so late it was almost in the slips by the time his defensive bat made contact. Sibley finally produced a sweep shot when he was on 99, but only because it now made sense to do so with the field up. His refusal to be hastened, to alter his tempo, to be erted from the process was glorious, and indeed deeply moving.There was development here, too, subtle shifts of angle and intent. Sibley appeared to have no off‑side game at all in New Zealand, to stand at the crease like a blinkered horse, unable even to see half of the outfield.In South Africa Sibley has moved across his stumps, given himself the freedom to nudge an off-side two, to apply the odd scathing cut. This wasn’t a six-and-a-half-hour hundred. It was a month-long hundred. And it bloomed in the shadow of that fifth day, in the sense of time in store, freedom to breathe and manoeuvre the day, the game, the opposition into his path.This is the key point. Yes: five days rarely happens in practice. But the entire tone and texture of the game flows backwards from its possibility. Take it away and there is no Sibley hundred, or at least not this Sibley hundred. Take away the fifth day and that endlessly varied tempo, the sense of depth, of layers in reserve, is destroyed for ever (not to mention the entire thing wiped out with a bit of rain).Here’s another point the profit and loss account won’t reveal: slow things are good. Slow change, frustration, dullness, lost half‑hours. Test cricket tells us about life, that there are periods of death and slackness and frustration. The most unforgettable moments in this sport – and thereby in all sport – are functions of this. Jack Leach running a single. Monty Panesar blocking for half an hour. These are, without context, banal interludes. In context they become irresistible, powerful, in ways that can’t be staged or forced or hurried.Yes, change is necessary. Change is often a good thing in its own right. T20 as a gateway to Tests, all forms interlocking and feeding into one another: this was the model we were sold, one that still makes plenty of sense. Here we have the reality. There is no argument for creating a four-day Test that isn’t to do with saving money.A four-day Test would save on broadcast logistics, staff hires and fixed costs of every kind. But it would do absolutely nothing for the sport itself, would instead cheapen and subtract in ways that can never be put back.Five days of Test cricket: this is an improbable kind of beauty, something that wouldn’t get past the first pitch meeting now. And yet it remains for all its fragilities the best form of the best sport an entity that can only be destroyed or preserved from here. Time to pick a side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce81dcc013de361b25a525f79afdb59abfe0f523/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7476ab640153709151fe8264ee85f5","title":"fringe binge world first vr theatre livr","story":"LIVR allows subscribers to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. How does it compare with the fringe experience?I’m having a beer and enjoying an Edinburgh fringe show from the front row. But I’m on the sofa rather than a folding chair, there’s a cat on my lap and the beer didn’t cost £6. While the pet and the beverage are optional, the large pair of goggles I’m wearing are not. Much fancier headsets are available but this one – which works with my smartphone – comes with a subscription to LIVR, “the world’s first virtual reality content platform dedicated to theatre”.It’s fringe theatre in particular that the company has focused on. The 360-degree VR experience situates you in the middle of the front row and lets you immerse yourself in the show. Instead of a conventional film, where the emphases have been predetermined in the editing suite, you can choose what to concentrate on. You can switch focus on different performers as they move around the stage and into the audience and, in a manner that would be downright shifty in the theatre, turn and gawp at your neighbours’ reactions to the show. All of this distinguishes LIVR’s service from, say, the polished and slickly edited productions available online from Digital Theatre, which also tend to have bigger budgets and starrier casts. The biggest actor in LIVR’s current offerings is Gyles Brandreth, whose Hamlet with his son Benet at Park theatre is one of the service’s most watched shows.Mostly, LIVR gives you a chance to experience fringe shows that you may have missed at a festival and, in some cases, are no longer being performed. Leo Kellgren-Parker, the company’s founder, says: “The majority of our audience is based outside London so they use it as a chance to catch things that may not have toured. We wanted to create a place where people can experience shows when it suits them. I like the idea of someone finding a gem long after it would have gone otherwise.” The current catalogue of 60-odd shows includes gig theatre, monologues, puppetry and comedy, with a new batch of titles added each month.While some acclaimed fringe hits have been adapted for short TV versions – such as Half Breed and Ad Libido, which both recently became Comedy Blaps on Channel 4 – this is a chance to relive the rough and ready original. It also allows users to graze on several shows, as you might at a festival.“Internationally, we are seeing binge consumption, particularly from the US,” says Kellgren-Parker. “As they have no name recognition they are picking shows they like the sound of with an entirely open mind. They seem to be watching more shows per month than we had expected people to.”I start my own fringe binge with Chase Scenes, which I missed at the Edinburgh festival in 2018. Ming Hon’s raw, traumatic and sometimes funny production recreates 60 movie pursuits in 60 minutes. Hon, whose work as a film classifier inspired the show, performs alongside two other actresses. They take turns to wield video cameras, filming each other, with the footage projected on a split screen behind them. If this sounds like it might be quite complicated to follow, the way you choose to frame the action yourself using VR – rather than watching an edited version of the production – neatly complements the performers’ methods. “Almost all my performances use live camera with live projection,” Hon tells me. “I’ve always been interested in how an audience experiences and navigates between watching live performers and the irresistible seduction of moving images on a lit-up screen.”Watching the VR version of Chase Scenes feels like you are in the middle of the show – props lie at your feet and you twist your neck around to follow Hon running in and out of the audience. Hon says that recording the show was simple. “The camera operator took one seat in the audience and the camera, which looks like a stick with a robot head, sits beside them. I was able to play up and perform to the camera like it was a real human audience member which was really fun.” She has been reflecting on VR within the pornography industry as part of her next show, Exciting Consequences, which explores the tropes and cliches of pornography VR porn – “about making the sexual experience as real as possible” – is booming.I check out some more of LIVR’s offerings. The Brandreths’ Hamlet, on a set dominated by a kitchen table, feels a tad flat to me, as does Famous Puppet Death Scenes, which has a set design like a Punch and Judy booth. Neither seems to take great advantage of the possibilities of VR, but then hardly any fringe productions are being designed with the technology in mind. That may change – and VR may well be developed to suit immersive and promenade performances. Electrolyte, a scrappy and energetic bit of gig theatre, is a good VR fit and I’m gripped by the immediacy of Apphia Campbell’s storytelling and singing in Woke. The technology also suits the decidedly analogue For the Record, an intimate solo show by the poet Toby Thompson, in which he shares coffee and LPs with the audience. It’s a black-box fringe experience perfectly preserved: you can look up to the low ceiling, count the audience members around you, and even hear mutterings from outside the venue.All of these productions were new to me so I watch one of my favourite shows from last year, Songlines by Tallulah Brown, recorded at Edinburgh’s Pleasance Beside venue. This teen romance, with live music, is even better than I remembered and this time I get a better view as I’m up close and dead centre in the first row. Sometimes that can feel awkward as an audience member – when I saw the unpredictable comic Jordan Brookes in the same venue I was sure to avoid the front row. There are hearty laughs during Songlines, and when I look around at my neighbours I’m surprised to find the venue is probably at half capacity it’s a striking contrast to the way filmed performances often try to convey a packed audience.Ming Hon, who is based in Winnipeg, Canada, says that the VR version of Chase Scenes means she can find audiences she’d never otherwise reach. But I wonder if other performers worry about the impact on ticket sales if their show is already available in a sophisticated version online. Although LIVR says it is happy to remove a film from the site when that show is out on tour, the activist and theatremaker Nathaniel Hall says the two are different experiences. He is about to tour the UK with his show First Time, which is also on LIVR. “VR can help us reach people in rural areas, or who are unable to travel, or feel uncomfortable in the restrictive atmosphere of the theatre space,” he adds. “First Time is a show that transforms people’s attitudes to HIV and HIV stigma – the more people that can access the story, the better. I’m excited about how VR could help address the cost of taking theatre to hard-to-reach audiences in the future. I would love to take 20 headsets to a school, watch the show together and then run a workshop afterwards. With correct investment, this could help get important but expensive theatre and stories into cash-strapped schools and community spaces.”In the future, VR versions of shows may be used increasingly by theatre programmers too, but Hall also stresses their importance for performers themselves. “I was intrigued to study my own performance using this technology. It’s the closest I’ll ever get to sitting with my audience, kicking back and just enjoying the show.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab22fbc856fbe82fc306dcd9c7cb7642cdcd4a1f/0_335_5970_3582/master/5970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4d492cf27496fbe854723b501766851","title":"aoc finds perfect puppy which other politicians found theirs","story":"The congresswoman says her French bulldog will come with her to the office and to town halls, making them an ideal pairThe dog appears to be a French bulldog, an intelligent dog known for its stubborn streak. That’s perhaps an obvious fit for the freshman congresswoman, who ousted a 10-term incumbent without any lobbyist cash (although it is worth noting that concerns have been raised around this breed, as some have trouble breathing).As legend has it, a dog says a lot about its owner. That saying surely holds even more relevance when it comes to politicians. Second only to babies, pets are a choice weapon for politicians who want to soften their image. Their canine best friend holds a special role: to project the image that the politician wants the public to have of them.Here is our take on what the following dogs say about their political owners.Mayor Pete wants you to know his dog is a fighter. Part pug, part beagle, his dog Buddy only has one eye and looks somewhat menacing. Which is just as well, considering Buttigieg’s attempts at convincing us of his fighting credentials haven’t exactly paid off.Buttigieg has mentioned his time in the military hundreds of times during his campaign trail, describing it as “dangerous”, and bragging about time he spent “outside the wire”. Alas, documents seem to suggest that Buttigieg didn’t spend any time in direct combat during his time in the army. But the dog still looks tough.Boris Johnson’s dog is a Jack Russell with floppy blonde hair. They say a Jack Russell is a small dog with a big attitude, which is pretty fitting for a prime minister who wrote a back-up newspaper column arguing that the UK should stay in the EU, then campaigned to leave, pushed for a hard Brexit and asked everyone if they still wanted to be mates after.The Canadian prime minister has many things going for him. He recently got a beard, when he roasts Donald Trump alongside world leaders they all laugh, and he has a cute dog. No wonder Melania kissed him.When Elizabeth Warren was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, her students surprised her one day with a golden retriever puppy. That puppy, Otis, didn’t make it to see Warren’s presidential bid, having died in 2012. But Warren, ever the woman with a plan, wasn’t going to let that stop her. She replaced Otis last year with another golden retriever, this time named Bailey.Joe Biden has two dogs, and like any guy trying to rebuild the soul of the nation, he rescued them both. Biden’s dogs are German shepherds named Champ and Major – although he probably would have called them “Man” and “Folks”, if they were more acceptable dog names.We are aware that Marlon Bundo is a rabbit, not a dog. Mike Pence also has a dog, but that seemed far less interesting than Bundo, who has its own Wikipedia page. Bundo is colloquially known as Botus – or Bunny of the United States. He has been described as the “only positive thing in Washington”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country. Share your stories The American Embassy in Baghdad is calling for all US citizens in Iraq to leave the country as soon as possible.In the early hours of 3 January, Iran’s most powerful general Qassem Suleimani was killed outside Baghdad airport in an airstrike sanctioned by the US President, Donald Trump. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, de-facto leader of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), and close associate of Suleimani, also died in the attack.The killing represents a significant acceleration in the escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. It followed just hours after the conclusion of a two-day siege against the US embassy in Baghdad by PMU militants, which was prompted by a US airstrike camps belonging to a PMU-affiliated militia, itself a response to that group’s killing of a US contractor at an Iraqi army base.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has sworn revenge for Suleimani’s death.The embassy said in a statement that it “urges American Citizens to heed the January 2020 Travel Advisory and depart Iraq immediately. US citizens should depart via airline while possible, and failing that, to other countries by land.”“Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the US Embassy compound, all public consular operations are suspended until further notice”, the statement added.We would like to hear from you if you are a US citizen in Iraq, or if you know someone who has been affected by the order to evacuate.Though we’d like to hear from you, your security is most important.

The response would no doubt be proportionate,” said Wallace, as parliament returned from the Christmas break.Britain has 400 troops in Iraq at present, currently focused on protecting themselves in the aftermath of the controversial killing by an American drone strike that has prompted speculation that Tehran will seek to hit back at western interests.Two British warships are already stationed near the Gulf, the HMS Montrose and the HMS Defender, which are ready to escort British flagged oil tankers through the strait of Hormuz if required.On Friday, Wallace updated MPs for the first time since the killing of Suleimani, and faced questions about whether he believed the drone strike outside Baghdad airport had been legal.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, asked: “So does the government regard the assassination as legal under international law? If so, how? And do the lawyers in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence regard it as legal?“If he really believes this was an act of self defence, what evidence has he or the prime minister seen of the imminent attack on the US?”The US has repeatedly said it launched the drone strike that killed Suleimani after receiving intelligence he was planning attacks on American personnel in Iraq, without providing further details.Johnson was conspicuously absent from the debate. The prime minister has not appeared in public since returning from holiday in the Caribbean over the weekend – prompting Corbyn to accuse Johnson of “hiding behind his defence secretary”.Wallace hit back, saying: “Funnily enough, the prime minister is running the country, something the leader of the opposition will fail to ever do.” Wallace said Johnson believed cabinet members should answer questions where appropriate.Wallace also promised to “issue guidance imminently” to oil tankers and other British flagged merchant shipping passing through the strait of Hormuz and said the threat was being reviewed on a daily basis.Defence sources also said that about 50 British personnel had been ordered out of Baghdad’s secure Green Zone, and relocated for their own safety to either Camp Taji, 24 miles (40km) north of the Iraqi capital, or out of the country.Meanwhile, about 20 military planners have flown to Iraq help prepare for a range of scenarios, from an escalation of conflict with Iran to a full departure of British forces from the country. They were engaged in “contingency planning”, Wallace told MPs.The deployment means that the UK’s overall contribution to coalition troop numbers in Iraq remains at about 400, with the majority stationed alongside Australian forces at Camp Taji.On Sunday, British forces in Iraq halted their work helping train Iraqi soldiers to counter Islamic State. The soldiers are now focused on “force protection” – guarding themselves against potential local reprisals, particularly from pro-Iran militias.Meanwhile, Rob Macaire, the UK ambassador to Iran, was summoned to meet the Iranian European affairs minister after Johnson said he did not lament Soleimani’s death and the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the UK was on “the same page” as the US.Following the meeting, IRNA – the semi-official Iranian news agency – reported a foreign ministry spokesman as saying “the people and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarded the positions adopted by the British government constitute an alliance with a US terrorist act. It cannot be justified and accepted, and with such positions Britain can be a partner in this crime.”Although the remarks do not mean that British troops would be regarded as legitimate targets in any potential Iranian reprisals, the summons underlines the risks UK ministers take in trying to remain politically aligned with the inconsistant Trump administration.Privately, some British ministers regard Trump’s decision to launch the strike against Suleimani as erratic, but the UK cannot afford to be seen as being out of step with its closest long-term ally, not least when US-UK trade talks are due to commence.Capita, the firm that handles recruitment for British army, said that they saw the highest number of applications to join in a single day on Monday. The heightened interest is likely tied to the possibility of conflict with Iran. Army recruitment traditionally increases when people believe there is a possibility of war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8923b2d1e3fc306f55b69f7985ed1ab018da7ec0/2262_924_1108_665/master/1108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cad5a9713cd29ec9884f7f1d6588adf","title":"cyprus case british teenager given suspended sentence","story":"Woman, 19, seen at Larnaca airport hours after being told she was free to leave countryA British teenager convicted of falsely accusing 12 Israelis of gang-rape was heading back to the UK on Tuesday night – hours after being told she was free to leave Cyprus having received a suspended sentence.The 19-year-old student, who has vowed to go all the way to the European court of human rights to clear her name, was spotted at Larnaca airport before her flight, where her mother told supporters: “We are delighted to be going home, where we will continue the fight to clear my daughter’s name. The fight is not over to get justice.”Earlier, the teenager was handed a four-month prison term, suspended for three years. The judge, Michalis Papathanasiou, said he would give her a “second chance” and she could effectively walk free.“The defendant has expressed regret,” he told the court in Paralimni, as chants from Cypriot and Israeli protesters gathered outside the building were heard. “I have decided to give her a second chance given her age, psychological state and immaturity.”There were hugs, tears and relief in the courtroom among family members and supporters when she was spared prison. The teenager stood motionless in the dock throughout, her head bent slightly as she listened to an interpreter.The suspended sentence will do little to allay what her lawyers described as an “incredibly sad and tragic case” for a young woman whose crime had been to report a sexual assault while on holiday in the party resort of Ayia Napa last July.The Briton turned from victim to suspect overnight when, in now disputed circumstances, she withdrew the rape complaint after eight hours of police questioning.Within hours of the retraction, the Israelis she accused of gang-rape, aged between 15 and 22, with most of them about to enter the army as conscripts, were allowed to fly home. The investigation into the claims was dropped, with the teenager being forced to spend a month in Nicosia prison before being granted bail on the condition that she surrendered her passport.The sentencing took place a week after the young woman was convicted of wilfully indulging in public mischief for the offence of fabricating “an imaginary crime”. Speculation of a presidential pardon had mounted on the eve of the decision.Under the Cypriot penal code, the crime of fomenting public mischief is punishable by up to a year in prison with a penalty of as much as €1,708 (£1,450). The judge said the fine would be reduced to €140.The case has attracted international attention far beyond the frequently bizarre court proceedings, with critics claiming it had illuminated the deficiencies of a system that failed to take reports of sexual assault seriously.“Whilst we welcome the fact that the sentence imposed today allows her to go home … the fight for her innocence will go on regardless,” said Lewis Power QC, who added that her legal team would contest the guilty conviction in the Cyprus supreme court and, if necessary, the European court of human rights.“We say and will maintain that this young girl was stripped both of her dignity and basic human rights … This case has highlighted a gaping chasm in the specialised treatment of sexual assault victims in Cyprus,” he said.Women’s groups spurred into action in Cyprus had been emboldened by the backing of outraged Israelis, who flew in to join protests. Many described the outcome as a “superficial victory”, supporting the teenager’s pledge to oppose the sentence.Several Israeli men appalled by the student’s treatment were among them. Wearing a T-shirt with the words “Our sister I believe you”, Yuval Newman said he had been so “angry and shocked” by the guilty verdict that he had decided to fly into Cyprus with his 16-year-old son.“To put all the blame on this young woman is so wrong,” Newman said. “So much needs to change in Israel around the way teenagers treat women. I have brought my son with me in the hope that he will learn from this and go away knowing that women need to be treated properly.”The Briton, whose mother said she wanted to become a police officer, had been due to start studying criminology at university in the autumn. Since the alleged attack – described by the teenager as taking place when she was having consensual sex with one member of the group – she has had severe post-traumatic stress disorder and been taking antidepressants.An expedited appeal request will be lodged with the Cyprus supreme court by 17 January to ensure the case is heard within six months, said her senior Cypriot lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou.“We are all relieved that she will not have to go to prison and happy that the sentence is suspended, and she can get on with her life and take care of her mental health,” she said. “But we will pursue the appeal in an effort to have a final, positive acquittal decision.”In an indication of the diplomatic dimensions the case has assumed, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “Throughout this case, our focus has been on ensuring the young woman can return home. We’re very pleased this can now happen. We hope she and her family will now be given space and privacy so they can start rebuilding their lives.”The spokesman said the Foreign Office would work with Cyprus and other countries on how to avoid similar cases in the future, but reiterated that the UK government had “numerous concerns about the judicial process of this case and the woman’s right to a fair trial”, and had raised these with Cyprus.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, expressed relief that the “vulnerable young lady” was about to return home after six months.“I understand quite how much she’s been through and what her family’s been through,” he said. “We will be following up on some issues in relation to the case … There is the broader issue for Brits travelling not just in Cyprus or in the EU, but travelling abroad, whether it’s on holiday, whether it’s backpacking, and making sure they can do so as safely and securely as possible.”The administration of the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, had repeatedly said it could not interfere in the independent workings of the courts. Loudest among the protest chants heard as the judge read out his decision was “Cyprus justice, shame on you”.Verity Nevitt, who organised a march in London in solidarity with the teenager, called the Cypriot handling of the case “farcical”.She added: “Today, the judge proved that he is unfit to judge cases of sexual violence, he should be recalled from the role.“I am angry that the UK have behaved so pitifully in protecting one of their own, one who is already so vulnerable and in desperate need of support. Britain should have said no Briton is taking part in this farce of a judicial system and we are not allowing this joke trial to continue where a victim is being tried as a criminal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aac11063e488de787d2a4959a0d16dfd39e1eb78/0_22_4492_2695/master/4492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df0781dcf5dd479bec28c433d782956","title":"venezuela maduro parliament juan guaido leader","story":"Venezuela’s increasingly byzantine political meltdown took its latest turn on Tuesday as opponents of authoritarian president Nicolás Maduro stormed the country’s parliament to reinstall Juan Guaidó as their leader.Troops loyal to Maduro had surrounded the palm-dotted national assembly compound in Caracas in a bid to keep Guaidó and his supporters out after the president’s attempt to seize control of the parliament on Sunday.But in frantic scenes that spread rapidly on social media, Guaidó and his backers were filmed physically forcing their way into the 19th-century capitol to cheers of “Viva Venezuela!”Outside, pro-government thugs attacked and robbed Venezuelan and European journalists, including one correspondent from Spain’s El País.Inside, Guaidó was sworn in for a second term as Venezuela’s caretaker leader, even though the auditorium’s electricity had been cut.“In the name of those who have no voice, of the mothers who weep in the distance, of the teachers who are battling and the nurses and the students, of the political prisoners … in the name of Venezuela, I vow to fulfill the duties of interim president,” said Guaidó, who is recognized by more than 50 governments including the United States and United Kingdom but boasts little concrete power.Guaidó’s wife, Fabiana Rosales, tweeted: “Now the struggle goes on, together with all Venezuelans we will rescue our country from dictatorship.”The new decade has started with a bang in Venezuela, with Guaidó’s stuttering year-long campaign to topple Maduro suddenly reinvigorated by this week’s events.Even the leftwing governments of Argentina and Mexico were critical of Maduro’s attempt to take over Venezuela’s parliament on Sunday, with Argentina’s new foreign minister warning such actions would condemn Hugo Chávez’s heir to “international isolation”.Vanessa Neumann, Guaidó’s envoy to London, said she was convinced Maduro’s maneuver had backfired by reuniting Venezuela’s opposition behind her leader.“Guaidó emerges stronger from all of this,” Neumann insisted. “He has more legitimacy even than he did in 2019.”Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America, said Tuesday’s storming of the legislature represented “a clear symbolic victory” for Guaidó.“But I don’t think this fundamentally alters the equation,” he added.“The main problem for the opposition for the last two years has been how to get their democratic legitimacy to translate into real power on the ground. Unless Guaidó is able to get the masses into the streets in a way he hasn’t been able to for almost a year I don’t see much changing in the short term.”The coming weeks could prove crucial for Guaidó, who shot to prominence last January after using his position as national assembly president to declare himself Venezuela’s rightful interim leader.This Friday is the first anniversary of Maduro’s swearing-in, an event many western governments boycotted because of suspicions he stole the 2018 presidential election. 23 January marks a year since Guaidó publicly declared himself president.Ramsey said both sides would exploit those politically charged dates to pose as the “clear victors in this conflict”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4133240.1578425091!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"governments primed to release text of deal to restore stormont","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of the Democratic Unionist Party Arlene Foster speaks to media in the great hall of Stormont Parliament buildings in Belfast. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireThe British and Irish governments on Tuesday night were primed to release their best estimation of what constitutes an agreement to restore the Executive and Assembly.The text of the deal restore Stormont would be released to the public, as well as to Northern Ireland politicians.As Monday’s deadline for a deal approaches , Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the Northern Secretary Julian Smith met on Tuesday evening to plan their negotiating tactics for the coming days.Senior sources said Mr Coveney and Mr Smith planned not only to present their text of what would be a “fair and balanced” deal to the North’s five main parties this week but that they also were poised to release the document to the public.The sources said the text could be released as early as Wednesday or possibly Thursday. Sources said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Northern Secretary were “very keen on transparency”.It is understood that the politicians will have first sight of the document but that shortly thereafter, possibly the following day, the text will be released to the public.Both Mr Coveney and Mr Smith believe, the sources said, that three years after the collapse of Stormont, and after several rounds of failed negotiations to restore the Assembly, all the key isive issues have been discussed to exhaustion and that now is the time to present what they consider a good deal.They also believe in the midst of a health service crisis, a nurses strike on Wednesday and more health workers’ industrial action on Friday, as well as other pressures on the public services, that most people would believe that what is on offer to reinstate Stormont does constitute a reasonable deal.They hope, according to the sources, that public pressure on the politicians to get Stormont functioning again could assist in their efforts to bring back powersharing politics, notwithstanding the risk of one or more of the parties baulking at what they might see as an attempt to “bounce” them into a deal.The two main issues yet to be fully resolved, the sources said, are the Sinn Féin demand for an Irish language act and how and whether the petition of concern should be amended. The petition is a mechanism whereby with 30 signatories motions can be vetoed in the Assembly, even if they have majority support.Political weaponDUP negotiators came under pressure on Tuesday when the grand master of the Orange Order, the Rev Mervyn Gibson repeated his institution’s opposition to a standalone Irish language Act.He told the BBC he had no issues with the language but opposed it “being used as a political weapon”.What currently is on offer on the language, it is understood, involves over-arching cultural and identity legislation that also would include legislation on the Irish language.Dublin and London while believing what they have devised should satisfy both the public and most of the politicians also acknowledge that it will require some political compromise. This was reflected in what Mr Coveney told The  last week, “I don’t think any one party will read this (text) and say, ‘If I was going to write it this is what it would look like’. There are compromises required from everybody in order to make this work.”Political urgencyNegotiations ran all through Tuesday at Stormont and resume on Wednesday amid a greater sense of political urgency. Mr Smith said he will call Assembly elections if there is no deal by Monday and he is fully supported in this stance by Mr Coveney.Mr Smith on Tuesday updated the British cabinet on the talks. Boris Johnson told ministers that every effort must be made to find an agreement between the parties.“Everything that is possible must be done to restore the Executive before the deadline of January 13th. Three years without a government in Northern Ireland is far too long,” he said.DUP leader Arlene Foster said the negotiators were “alert” to this deadline. She said once the governments had presented the parties with their estimate of a deal the DUP would assess whether it addressed the party’s remaining concerns.She sounded a mildly positive note in saying, “I think everybody is in the space where they want to do a deal. Let’s get down, let’s focus and make sure we do that deal. We are ready to do a deal and if there is fair balanced text put toward us we will do that deal.”Ulster Unionist Party Assembly member Robbie Butler said a “more concerted effort to get these talks to a conclusion” was required from all the talks participants.“The problems and difficulties are well rehearsed. There have been three years of intensive and non-intensive talks and, as we can see, there is no real intensity. We would like to see that stepped up within the next 24 hours,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4133050.1578411476!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"historian accuses government of using advisory group like mud guard","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Professor Diarmaid Ferriter has said the expert advisory group on commemorations never suggested there should be a State event for the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin politan Police.  Photograph: Dave MeehanHistorian Professor Diarmaid Ferriter has said the expert advisory group on commemorations never suggested there should be a State event for the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin politan Police. He took issue with a statement by the Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan who said on Monday that the proposed State commemoration was made “under the guidance of the expert advisory group on centenary commemorations”.Mr Flanagan responded to the mounting furore over the commemoration event on January 17th in Dublin Castle by stressing that it was never intended to honour the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries too. He added: “This event is one of a large number of events taking place during this decade to acknowledge and commemorate significant events or developments in the history of our island one hundred years ago. “It is not a celebration. It is an acknowledgement the historical importance of both the DMP and the RIC, and is in no sense a commemoration of the Black and Tans or the Auxiliaries.” Professor Ferriter said the advisory group, which comprises of himself and other professional historians under the chairmanship of Dr Maurice Manning, did not recommend that a service for the RIC and the DMP be included in the list of State commemorations. He explained: “What we stated was that ‘consideration should be given to the organisation of specific initiatives to commemorate the RIC and the DMP and to acknowledge their place in history’.“What we had in mind was an academic event - a conference or seminar - that would look at the issue of policing in Ireland during the revolutionary period, including the role of and disbandment of the RIC and the foundation of the Civic Guard, which became An Garda Siochana.”He said the advisory group “should not be used by the Government as a mudguard to provide cover for itself when it receives negative reaction to its solo runs in relation to commemoration. “The EAG is not an executive body it is an advisory group. We have consistently maintained that commemoration should be locally rather than centrally led.” Instead, he maintained, the group proposed that “the commemorative model to mark the centenary of the Soloheadbeg Ambush is the correct approach to the observance of the sensitive and complex centenaries that will occur in 2020. “This approach advocates a leading role for local authorities in supporting and driving community-led commemoration, augmented with appropriate State assistance and participation. “The proposed RIC commemoration does not follow that model. What is being proposed was not put before the group and therefore was not discussed by the group and the minister should not refer to the event on 17th January in Dublin Castle as being as a result of our guidance.”Dr Manning said the advice given by the advisory group could be interpreted as including a State ceremony though he acknowledged that the group only specified a small number of State ceremonies. “It has never been our job to be prescriptive as to how events should be organised. It is up to the Government to decide the form it should be take. It is their absolute right to decide what should and should not be adopted,” he said.

Mr Varadkar has asked Mr Martin to support the Government in some Dáil votes if there is to be an agreed election date.The pair will meet on Thursday night to discuss the timing of the election and the end of the confidence and supply deal, which sees Fianna Fáil underpin the Fine Gael led minority government.However, Mr Martin told Newstalk he would not change his position that Fianna Fáil would only abstain rather than support the Government on certain votes.It sets up a confrontation between the pair at their Thursday meeting.“There is no question of Fianna Fáil taking that position, he knows that,” Mr Martin said, adding that Mr Varadkar should seek the support of Independents or smaller parties if he needed to make up the numbers in the Dáil.The meeting between the two will take place in Dublin although the time and venue have not yet been confirmed.Fianna Fáil TD for Roscommon Eugene Murphy said the time had come for an election, despite his leader saying April was the best time to go to the polls.“It’s just a personal view but I think we should have it sooner rather than later,” Mr Murphy said. “It time to have it and get it over with. It’s a personal view but a lot of people will agree with me. Let’s have it, let’s get it over with.”Thomas Byrne, Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman, said he awaited the meeting between Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin.But he added: “The public is getting anxious for an election and is extremely anxious for a change of government but we have to be careful with Brexit as smoothly as possible.”There is increasing speculation that the election date will fall within weeks, rather than months, with some Fine Gael TDs believing a February election is now on the cards.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said on Tuesday the Government needed to be able to enact Dáil business to continue, and this could require greater co-operation from Fianna Fáil.“We need to have clarity within the Dáil regarding the ability of the Government to be able to do its business and... continue to deliver very important pieces of legislation.”Mr Varadkar had also called for an agreed reform of the local property tax with Fianna Fáil, also seen as extremely difficult to secure.“In order to see those kinds of changes made in this Dáil, it will need an enhanced form of cooperation with Fianna Fáil,” Mr Donohoe added.“And the leader of Fianna Fáil has called for the orderly wind down of government.”Cabinet meetingThe Cabinet will hold a special meeting focusing on disability issues in Marino, Dublin, on Thursday. The venue is in the constituency of Finian McGrath, Minister of State for Disability Issues.Fine Gael Ministers and Ministers of State will hold a meeting on Friday morning, followed by a gathering of the Fine Gael parliamentary party that afternoon.Mr Varadkar is understood to have told people privately he wants the Stormont institutions back up and running before the election. The ongoing Stormont talks have a deadline of January 13th to succeed or fresh elections will be called in Northern Ireland.There has been some speculation in Fine Gael that, in the event of a successful conclusion to the Northern talks, Mr Varadkar could meet British prime minister Boris Johnson in Belfast to oversee the restoration of Stormont and that the pair could hold a meeting on Brexit and the future of British-Irish relations.Such a backdrop, suggest some Fine Gael sources, would provide a platform for him to call an election.When the election is called the leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are set to engage in a head-to-head general election debate, the first time the leaders of the two parties have squared off in 13 years.Both Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin are keen to hold a one-on-one debate during the forthcoming campaign.Mr Martin has already said he wants a head-to-head debate with Mr Varadkar during the campaign. And senior Fine Gael figures have confirmed Mr Varadkar favours such an encounter.Well-placed Fine Gael figures said they are open to two televised debates: one between all party leaders, including Sinn Féin, Labour, the Greens and potentially others, and one between the two contenders for the Taoiseach’s office.The 2016 and 2011 campaign debates featured a number of party leaders.The desires of both party leaders is dependent on the attitude of broadcasters RTÉ and Virgin Media. An RTÉ spokeswoman said: “The RTÉ Election Steering Committee will make any decisions around debates held on RTÉ. A wide number factors are taken into account and decisions have not yet been made.”A Virgin Media spokeswoman said plans are being drawn up for its general election coverage, with a leaders’ debate a centrepiece of its coverage."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4133107.1578414414!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new science in old places museums are crucial part of scientific research","story":"Maybe over your Christmas holidays you wandered into a museum. Let’s just say it was a natural history museum. As you walked around, you might have been overwhelmed by the abundance of exhibits and mothball perfume. In Dublin, there are at least 10,000 items on display.Everything, as Nigel Monaghan says, “from ants to aardvarks to zebras”. My personal favourites in the Dublin Natural History Museum, where Monaghan is the keeper, are the pangolins. They are related to anteaters and I had never heard of them before I saw them there.Other specimens are fascinating for the history and stories behind them, like the trophy heads collected during British imperial expansion and the migratory birds gathered after they fatally collided with Irish lighthouses.But providing weird and wonderful displays for the public is only a small part of what historical museums do. A museum is a place of living science, not just a place of preservation. Modern science needs historical collections and facilitating research is a crucial part of “keeping” a museum. Monaghan and his colleague Paolo Viscardi (assistant keeper with a focus on zoology) are enthusiastic about the scientific treasures they work to preserve.Climate change and bioersity are some of the big areas of science that museum collections can help researchers to study. As Monaghan puts it, “Museum collections are key to understanding bioersity over the last few centuries.” And of course human actions have been a huge factor in reducing bioersity over the same time period.Monaghan points to a creative study using the museum’s 17,000 bird skins (birds that have been “boned and rolled”, he explains). Researchers interested in pollution have been examining old bird specimens to see what kind of particles have been clinging to their feathers for the past 100 or so years.More recent scientific methods allow researchers to make new findings from old material. For example, Monaghan’s own interest is in Irish ice age fauna. A research group that he has worked with has been using bones collected in Ireland (mostly in cave deposits) during the 19th and 20th centuries.With radio carbon dating and DNA analysis it is now possible to be much more accurate about which species were here and when. For example, scientists now believe that red deer actually arrived in Ireland with people around 5,000 years ago. The deer provided useful antlers for tools as well as meat and hides.Paolo Viscardi draws my attention to the research importance of some of the smallest organisms held by the museum. There is a lot of recent interest, for example, in a collection of parasitic wasps created in the middle of the 19th century by Alexander Haliday. He opens one of Haliday’s entomology cases to show me and it’s fair to say they are bit less charismatic than pangolins.Some of them are, as Viscardi says, “the size of a full stop”. Parasitic wasps “can be quite useful pest control agents” because different species of the wasps lay their eggs on those of another species of insect thus reducing its population without the need for pesticide.Thanks to Haliday’s enthusiasm, probably not driven by an interest in organic agriculture, the Dublin museum has around 1,000 type specimens of parasitic wasps and researchers working on the group are keen to access them. This has meant painstaking efforts by the team in Dublin to rehouse the specimens in modern storage to prevent loss or damage.Gluing tiny wasps to cards, as Haliday did, is no longer advised. Other collections of tiny organisms include thousands of nematodes (flatworms), many of which are type specimens. Many of these nematodes, Viscardi explains, came from an Irish bog and give information about soil health. While I am chatting with him Viscardi receives an email inquiry about the museum’s collection of stoats. They are of interest because Irish stoats are stoatally different (sorry) than British varieties: they don’t change their coat in the winter.There is something reassuring about the way that the Dead Zoo doesn’t change much. I can return and find my pangolins any day I like. But behind the scenes our natural history museums are full of evidence of change.Pangolins, for example, are under threat from poaching and might one day exist only in museum collections. The story of the changing natural world, and our role in that change, will continue to be the most important scientific story of the future.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131088.1578246790!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tehran s overrated military strategist made many political miscalculations","story":"Hundreds of thousands gather in the Iranian capital of Tehran for the funeral of military commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by a US drone on the orders of US president Donald Trump. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIranians carry the coffin of Qassem Suleimani: If Iran had a free press and a real parliament, he would have been fired for colossal mismanagement. Photograph: Mohammad Hossein TaghiOne day they may name a street after President Donald Trump in Tehran. Why? Because Trump just ordered the assassination of possibly the dumbest man in Iran and the most overrated strategist in the Middle East: Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani.Think of the miscalculations this guy made. In 2015, the US and the major European powers agreed to lift virtually all their sanctions on Iran, many dating back to 1979, in return for Iran halting its nuclear weapons programme for a mere 15 years but still maintaining the right to have a peaceful nuclear programme. It was a great deal for Iran. Its economy grew by over 12 per cent the next year. And what did Suleimani do with that windfall?He and Iran’s supreme leader launched an aggressive regional imperial project that made Iran and its proxies the de facto controlling power in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Sanaa. This freaked out US allies in the Sunni Arab world and Israel, and they prevailed on the Trump administration to respond by tearing up the nuclear deal and imposing oil sanctions on Iran that have now shrunk the Iranian economy by almost 10 per cent and sent unemployment to more that 16 per cent.All that for the pleasure of saying that Tehran can call the shots in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Sanaa. What exactly was second prize?By severely depriving the Tehran regime of funds, the ayatollahs had to raise gasoline prices at home, triggering massive domestic protests. That required a harsh crackdown by Iran’s clerics against their own people that left thousands jailed and killed, further weakening the legitimacy of the regime.Israeli intelligenceThen Mr “Military Genius” Suleimani decided that, having propped up the regime of President Bashar Assad in Syria and helping to kill 500,000 Syrians in the process, he would overreach again and try to put direct pressure on Israel. He would do this by trying to transfer precision-guided rockets from Iran to Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon and Syria.Alas, Suleimani discovered that fighting Israel – specifically, its combined air force, special forces, intelligence and cyber – is not like fighting the Nusra front or the Islamic State group. The Israelis hit back hard, sending a whole bunch of Iranians home from Syria in caskets and hammering their proxies as far away as western Iraq.Indeed, Israeli intelligence had so penetrated Suleimani’s Quds Force and its proxies that Suleimani would land a plane with precision munitions in Syria at 5pm and the Israeli air force would blow it up by 5.30pm. Suleimani’s men were like fish in a barrel. If Iran had a free press and a real parliament, he would have been fired for colossal mismanagement.But it gets better, or actually worse, for Suleimani. Many of his obituaries say that he led the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq, in tacit alliance with America. Well, that’s true. But what they omit is that Suleimani’s, and Iran’s, overreaching in Iraq helped to produce the Islamic State group in the first place.It was Suleimani and his Quds Force pals who pushed Iraq’s Shia prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, to push Sunnis out of the Iraqi government and army, stop paying salaries to Sunni soldiers, kill and arrest large numbers of peaceful Sunni protesters and generally turn Iraq into a Shia-dominated sectarian state. The Islamic State group was the counterreaction.Finally, it was Suleimani’s project of making Iran the imperial power in the Middle East that turned Iran into the most hated power in the Middle East for many of the young, rising pro-democracy forces – both Sunnis and Shias – in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.As Iranian-American scholar Ray Takeyh pointed out in a wise essay in Politico, in recent years, “Suleimani began expanding Iran’s imperial frontiers. For the first time in its history, Iran became a true regional power, stretching its influence from the banks of the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Suleimani understood that Persians would not be willing to die in distant battlefields for the sake of Arabs, so he focused on recruiting Arabs and Afghans as an auxiliary force. He often boasted that he could create a militia in little time and deploy it against Iran’s various enemies.”Massive corruptionIt was precisely those Suleimani proxies – Hizbullah in Lebanon and Syria, the Popular Mobilisation Forces in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen – that created pro-Iranian Shia states-within-states in all of these countries. And it was precisely these states-within-states that helped to prevent any of these countries from cohering, fostered massive corruption and kept these countries from developing infrastructure such as schools, roads, electricity.And therefore it was Suleimani and his proxies – his “kingmakers” in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq – who increasingly came to be seen, and hated, as imperial powers in the region, even more so than Trump’s America. This triggered popular, authentic, bottom-up democracy movements in Lebanon and Iraq that involved Sunnis and Shias locking arms together to demand non-corrupt, non-sectarian democratic governance.On November 27th, Iraqi Shias – yes, Iraqi Shias – burned down the Iranian consulate in Najaf, Iraq, removing the Iranian flag from the building and putting an Iraqi flag in its place. That was after Iraqi Shias, in September 2018, set the Iranian consulate in Basra ablaze, shouting condemnations of Iran’s interference in Iraqi politics.The whole “protest” against the US embassy compound in Baghdad last week was almost certainly a Suleimani-staged operation to make it look as if Iraqis wanted America out when in fact it was the other way around. The protesters were paid pro-Iranian militiamen. No one in Baghdad was fooled by this.In a way, it’s what got Suleimani killed. He so wanted to cover his failures in Iraq he decided to start provoking the Americans there by shelling their forces, hoping they would overreact, kill Iraqis and turn them against the US. Trump, rather than taking the bait, killed Suleimani instead.I have no idea whether this was wise or what will be the long-term implications. But here are two things I do know about the Middle East.First, often in the Middle East the opposite of “bad” is not “good”. The opposite of bad often turns out to be “disorder”. Just because you take out a really bad actor like Suleimani doesn’t mean a good actor, or a good change in policy, comes in his wake. Suleimani is part of a system called the Islamic Revolution in Iran. That revolution has managed to use oil money and violence to stay in power since 1979 – and that is Iran’s tragedy, a tragedy that the death of one Iranian general will not change.Emptiness of regimeToday’s Iran is the heir to a great civilisation and the home of an enormously talented people and significant culture. Wherever Iranians go in the world today, they thrive as scientists, doctors, artists, writers and filmmakers – except in the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose most famous exports are suicide bombing, cyberterrorism and proxy militia leaders. The very fact that Suleimani was probably the most famous Iranian in the region speaks to the utter emptiness of this regime and how it has wasted the lives of two generations of Iranians by looking for dignity in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways.The other thing I know is that in the Middle East all important politics happens the morning after the morning after.Yes, in the coming days there will be noisy protests in Iran, the burning of American flags and much crying for the “martyr”. The morning after the morning after? There will be a thousand quiet conversations inside Iran that won’t get reported. They will be about the travesty that is their own government and how it has squandered so much of Iran’s wealth and talent on an imperial project that has made Iran hated in the Middle East.And yes, the morning after, America’s Sunni Arab allies will quietly celebrate Suleimani’s death, but we must never forget that it is the dysfunction of many of the Sunni Arab regimes – their lack of freedom, modern education and women’s empowerment – that made them so weak that Iran was able to take them over from the inside with its proxies.I write these lines while flying over New Zealand, where the smoke from forest fires 2,500 miles away over eastern Australia can be seen and felt. Mother Nature doesn’t know Suleimani’s name, but everyone in the Arab world is going to know her name. Because the Middle East, particularly Iran, is becoming an environmental disaster area – running out of water, with rising desertification and overpopulation. If governments there don’t stop fighting and come together to build resilience against climate change – rather than celebrating self-promoting military frauds who conquer failed states and make them fail even more – they’re all doomed. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Juries\u0026#39 rape myths challenged amid slump in convictions in trialsBritish teenager in Cyprus rape case \u0026#39would have tried to kill herself\u0026#39 if sent to prison, grandparents sayComment: Boris should only back Trump over Iran if it’s in the UK’s interestsBBC must engage with UK\u0026#39s erse communities if it is to remain \u0026#39the broadcaster of choice\u0026#39, June Sarpong says in first major addressBrussels fires warning shot over citizens\u0026#39 rights after Brexit as EU chief visits No 10 for talksLaw Society tells firms to swap boozy work events for escape rooms and pizza making to prevent sexual harassment and bullyingBoris Johnson orders ministers to root out the waste in Whitehall and \u0026#39spare no sacred cows\u0026#39Uri Geller applies for job at No 10 after Dominic Cumming appealed for ‘weirdos’ and ‘misfits’Iran brands Britain America\u0026#39s \u0026#39partner in crime\u0026#39 over handling of Qassim Soleimani assassination Spain forms coalition after nine months without government in tight voteJuan Guaido sworn in as re-elected head of National Assembly after opposition storm past Maduro\u0026#39s guardsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle praise \u0026#39beautiful Vancouver\u0026#39 in first public appearance since November Labour leadership latest: Lisa Nandy warns the party will \u0026#39die\u0026#39 if it does not change coursePrince Charles speaks of his despair at \u0026#39appalling horror\u0026#39 of Australian bushfiresComment: Please Auntie Beeb, leave Crackerjack in the Seventies where it belongsBrazilian woman\u0026#39s face rebuilt with help of her smartphoneMuslim school told girls that university was \u0026#39not for them\u0026#39, Ofsted report findsFrench publisher pulls books by writer accused of child sexual abuseSinged and raw, koalas are fighting for survival in hospital as bushfires sweep across AustraliaComment: The real scandal of the Ayia Napa rape case is the shocking behaviour of Cyprus\u0026#39s courts and policeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/07/TELEMMGLPICT000219870515_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql1J1wGnzJNTXGdkb2TwJTjPSsEadoY3uv1rYAjDDsWc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"britain accused not everything free nationals held iran espionage","story":"Iranian prosecutors have dropped espionage charges against Franco-Iranian academic Adelkhah FaribaThe UK has been accused of “not doing everything” possible to free its nationals held in Iran after the country dropped espionage charges against an Iranian-French academic but offered no such clemency against British detainees.Iranian prosecutors have withdrawn the charge of espionage, which carries the death penalty, against Sciences Po University academic Fariba Adelkhah, according to her lawyer and Paris-based support committee, which said it had received confirmation from the French foreign ministry.She has been moved out of solitary confinement and is permitted regular family visits.The announcement came amid simmering tensions with the West in the wake of the death of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike last Friday.However, there has been no such positive development for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual British and Iranian citizen who was arrested in Tehran in April 2016 and sentenced to five years in jail by Tehran’s Revolutionary Court on espionage charges that her family insist are utter lies.”Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, and whose husband said is going on hunger strike to protest her detentionSpeaking to the  the charity worker\u0027s husband Richard Ratcliffe said: The French seem to be having some success - despite everything going on. It shows (Foreign Secretary Dominic) Raab that he is evidently not doing everything, despite the briefing.”He has previously said he believed his wife\u0027s release was dependent on the interest on a £450 million debt the UK has owed to Iran since the 1970s for a cancelled arms deal.Last week he said she would join Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a British-Australian academic, in going on hunger strike.Ms Adelkhah, an expert on Iran and Shiite Islam, was arrested in Tehran in June last year and went on hunger strike on December 24 after she was refused bail.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, slammed her detention as “intolerable” and called for her release without delay, prompting Iran to castigate France for unacceptable interference in internal affairs. Mr Ratcliffe said France’s decision to meet with the Iranian ambassador over Christmas appears to have helped and that she may have been picked up for a prisoner swap, as was the case with the British-Australian tourists caught flying a drone last year. British-Australian national Jolie King and her partner Mark Firkin were released from Iranian arrest in OctoberThe prosecution also dropped its case against Ms Adelkhah for disturbing the public order.She still faces two other charges: spreading propaganda against the political system of the Islamic republic and conspiracy against national security”, said her lawyer Said Dehghan.Her Sciences Po colleague Roland Marchal was also arrested last June while visiting Ms Adelkhah and charged withcollusion against national security.Mr Ratcliffe said: Last Wednesday evening Fariba was moved out of solitary and joined the women’s ward, which is always a good sign.Our understanding is that Roland (Marchal) was also moved out of 2A at the same time. When she came into the ward a few days back she was still on hunger strike.She still is on hunger strike - and everyone is getting pretty worried. Only drinking water. And her weight had dropped below 40kg.”Mr Ratcliffe said she is now in a bad state, which might concern Iran.The Iranian authorities will be thinking through their options at this point, he said.He added: Our top priority at the moment is just to keep people safe. Which means getting them out of direct IRGC control, Even if only to the public wards. Otherwise Nazanin and the others are going to become for the IRGC human shields.Sherri Izadi, 56, says hopes of her husband Anoosheh Ashoori being released from jail in Iran on espionage charge had been destroyedSherry Izadi, the wife of a British-Iranian engineer Anoosheh Ashoori - also held in prison in Tehran - has said she fears he no longer stands a “hope in hell” of being released after the US strike on Soleimani. Mrs Izadi, 56, said the Foreign Office had not been much help in her husband’s case, telling her there was little it could do as Tehran does not recognise dual nationalities.“It all depends how British government will react to this situation now,” she said. “I’m hoping there will be a rational reaction.”There are as many as five people with British connections or nationality that are being held in Iran.Jean-François Bayart, a friend and colleague of Ms Adelkhah and member of a Paris-based support group, welcomed the dropped charges, which he said was confirmed by French diplomats.He said it was “encouraging” that the court chose not to “harden” its position in light of the US airstrike, instead ruling that “the case against her was empty, as we knew all along”.But he said he remained “vigilant and prudent” given Iran’s “tough” track record of holding on to dual nationals.British teenager in Cyprus rape case \u0026#39would have tried to kill herself\u0026#39 if sent to prison, grandparents sayComment: Boris should only back Trump over Iran if it’s in the UK’s interestsBBC must engage with UK\u0026#39s erse communities if it is to remain \u0026#39the broadcaster of choice\u0026#39, June Sarpong says in first major addressBrussels fires warning shot over citizens\u0026#39 rights after Brexit as EU chief visits No 10 for talksLaw Society tells firms to swap boozy work events for escape rooms and pizza making to prevent sexual harassment and bullyingBoris Johnson orders ministers to root out the waste in Whitehall and \u0026#39spare no sacred cows\u0026#39Uri Geller applies for job at No 10 after Dominic Cumming appealed for ‘weirdos’ and ‘misfits’Iran brands Britain America\u0026#39s \u0026#39partner in crime\u0026#39 over handling of Qassim Soleimani assassination Spain forms coalition after nine months without government in tight voteJuan Guaido sworn in as re-elected head of National Assembly after opposition storm past Maduro\u0026#39s guardsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle praise \u0026#39beautiful Vancouver\u0026#39 in first public appearance since November Labour leadership latest: Lisa Nandy warns the party will \u0026#39die\u0026#39 if it does not change coursePrince Charles speaks of his despair at \u0026#39appalling horror\u0026#39 of Australian bushfiresComment: Please Auntie Beeb, leave Crackerjack in the Seventies where it belongsBrazilian woman\u0026#39s face rebuilt with help of her smartphoneMuslim school told girls that university was \u0026#39not for them\u0026#39, Ofsted report findsFrench publisher pulls books by writer accused of child sexual abuseSinged and raw, koalas are fighting for survival in hospital as bushfires sweep across AustraliaComment: The real scandal of the Ayia Napa rape case is the shocking behaviour of Cyprus\u0026#39s courts and policeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/06/TELEMMGLPICT000000859327_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGQR7TMwEvfaYG0TH6J-Ry5lILqztKIHB_tAxKYW05hY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"please auntie beeb leave crackerjack seventies belongs","story":"It feels odd to watch a grown woman pretending to be a schoolboyThe hardest thing to explain to my sons about the 1970s is the soul-sapping levels of boredom children endured.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change. Calls for leaders to act echo around the globe as the signs of a changing climate become ever more difficult to ignoreFierce wildfires have flared up in numerous countries. The damage being caused is unprecedented: 103 people were killed in wildfires last year in California, one of the places best prepared, best equipped to fight such blazes in the worldEntire towns have been razed. The towns of Redding and Paradise in California were all but eliminated in the 2018 seasonWhile wildfires in Greece (pictured), Australia, Indonesia and many other countries have wrought chaos to infrastructure, economies and cost livesIn Britain, flooding has become commonplace. Extreme downpours in Carlisle in the winter of 2015 saw the previous record flood level being eclipsed by two feetHebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has flooded repeatedly in the past decade, with the worst coming on Christmas Day 2015. Toby Smith of Climate Visuals, an organisation focused on improving how climate change is depicted in the media, says: Extreme weather and flooding, has and will become more frequent due to climate change. An increase in the severity and distribution of press images, reports and media coverage across the nation has localised the issue. It has raised our emotions, perception and personalised the effects and hazards of climate change.Out west in Somerset, floods in 2013 led to entire villages being cut off and isolated for weeksIn summer 2012, intense rain flooded over 8000 properties. In 2013, storms and coastal surges combined catastrophically with elevated sea levels whilst December 2015, was the wettest month ever recorded. Major flooding events continued through the decade with the UK government declaring flooding as one of the nation\u0027s major threats in 2017,  says Mr Smith of Climate VisualsWeather has been more extreme in Britain in recent years. The \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 which arrived in February 2018 brought extraordinarily cold temperatures and high snowfall. Central London (pictured), where the city bustle tends to mean that snow doesn\u0027t even settle, was covered in inches of snow for dayMonths after the cold snap, a heatwave struck Britain, rendering the normally plush green of England\u0027s parks in Summer a parched brown for weeksWorsening droughts in many countries have been disastrous for crop yields and have threatened livestock. In Australia, where a brutal drought persisted for months last year, farmers have suffered from mental health problems because of the threat to their livelihoodEven dedicated climate skeptic Jeremy Clarkson has come to recognise the threat of climate change after visiting the Tonle Sap lake system in Cambodia. Over a million people rely on the water of Tonle Sap for work and sustinence but, as Mr Clarkson witnessed, a drought has severley depleted the water levelIn reaction to these harbingers of climate obliteration, some humans have taken measures to counter the impending disaster. Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As they do, they block out a specific part of the infrared spectrum, and the new telescope will be able to see that and give scientists a clue to the distant worlds\u0027 atmosphere.Technology like the James Webb Space Telescope is the best hope for examining such distant planets, since they are too far away to ever visit or even to see in much detail, but it requires incredible advanced technology because of the weakness of the signals.Nasa loses contact with satellite monitoring mysterious exoplanetsBefore our work, oxygen at similar levels as on Earth was thought to be undetectable with Webb,\u0026nbspThomas\u0026nbspFauchez, from NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspand lead author of the study, said in a statement.This oxygen signal is known since the early\u0026nbsp1980s\u0026nbspfrom Earth\u0027s atmospheric studies but has never been studied for exoplanet research.Spotting oxygen on a planet might not be a guarantee that something lives there. Scientists have proposed alternative explanations that could create oxygen on exoplanets, and so it might not be a definitive indication that the world is alive.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This revision took it above November’s reading of 49.3.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Any improvement in the sector’s fortune is of course welcome, but this small improvement to the ‘no change’ mark means stagnation is also a possibility,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply (CIPS), which\u0026nbsppublished the report.“Other clouds of uncertainty must also include the potential for further political instability as negotiators and policymakers take the next steps.”Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The survey’s finding did offer hope for stronger output in 2020. The forward-looking business expectations index was the highest since September 2018.“The modest rebound in new work provides another signal that business conditions should begin to improve in the coming months, helped by a boost to business sentiment from greater Brexit clarity and a more predictable political landscape,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.Economists said that investors would now be looking for confirmation of a post-election boost in data to be published this month. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said markets would be looking at the “flash” estimates of output from the construction manufacturing and services sector on 17 January to see whether it might stop the Bank of England from cutting interest rates.Top FTSE 100 bosses will earn more than average worker by 5pm today“If this post-election bounce is repeated in other data … then it will probably be enough to prevent more Monetary Policy Committee members from voting for a rate cut,” Mr Pugh said. “But if there isn’t an uplift in the data over the next few months, then the MPC may step in to support the economy.”However, any upturn comes against an anaemic background. The seasonally adjusted composite index of all sectors registered 49.3 in December, unchanged from that seen in November and\u0026nbspthe joint-lowest since July 2016.The stabilisation of service sector activity in Monday’s figures was offset by a sharp and accelerated decline in manufacturing output to 45.6.Economists are not expecting a cut in governor Mark Carney’s final meeting\u0026nbspthis month, with the financial markets only pricing in a 10 per cent chance of a move.

This is because they are treated favourably and have more privileges,” the Ofsted report said. “Some of the girls told us that they do not like this. They said that this was not fair and feel disadvantaged.”Inspectors visited the school in November and concluded its unlawful segregation of pupils by sex is having a “negative impact” on girls’ education and self-confidence.It comes after the Court of Appeal concluded in 2017 that an Islamic faith school’s policy of segregating boys from girls was unlawful sex discrimination.Ofsted had placed the mixed-sex Al-Hijrah school in Birmingham into special measures in 2016 after it claimed iding classes was discriminatory.Saadat Rasool, headteacher of\u0026nbspRedstone\u0026nbspAcademy, has said it has no intention of defying the law in any way.He said: “We believe the idea that boys are ‘given favourable treatment and more opportunities than girls’ is just not accurate as all the previous Ofsted reports have noted that provision for boys and girls has been equal and fair.“We work very diligently to offer the best to both boys and girls at our school – and both are given equal opportunities to be successful in whatever they choose.”​Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t.

The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father.

The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years.

His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour.

Over that time they have detected hundreds of signals, though pinpointed very few.The search is difficult in part because they last for just miliseconds and could come from anywhere in the sky, making detailed examination of them incredibly difficult.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Now they have managed to locate another, in a nearby galaxy, taking the total to five.But they are perhaps more excited about the nature of the galaxy that is sending them out. It appears to be similar to our own, they say.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Identifying the host galaxy for\u0026nbspFRBs\u0026nbspis critical to tell us about what kind of environments\u0026nbspFRBs\u0026nbsplive in, and thus what might actually be producing\u0026nbspFRBs, said Sarah\u0026nbspBurke-Spolaor, assistant professor of physics and astronomy and co-author on a new paper in Nature.This is a question for which scientists are still grasping at straws.That discovery adds further mystery to the question of where FRBs are coming from. The first of the blasts came from a tiny galaxy made up of metals and newly formed stars, which led scientists to suggest they might be the result of the kind of stars found there – but that would not apply to the newly found galaxy.That means astronomers will have to consider other explanations of how FRBs\u0026nbspare generated, and might suggest there are multiple origins.The newly discovered source, named FRB ​180916,\u0026nbspis only half-a-billion light years from Earth and much nearer than other bursts that have been found in the past. It is seven times closer than the only other repeating burst that has been tracked down.That could allow for further study of the burst that could give further clues about where the bursts are coming from, scientists said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect.

(1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect. It has been a busy year for Chalamet, from starring roles in Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, which was largely snubbed in this year’s Bafta nominations,\u0026nbspto Netflix’s historical drama The King. He’s also set to star in Dune with Rebecca Ferguson and the forthcoming Wes Anderson film The French Dispatch.Director Mangold’s credits include\u0026nbspLe Mans ‘66,\u0026nbspwhich stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale and received rave reviews.The last high-profile Dylan biopic was 2007’s I’m Not There, which starred six different actors playing various sides of Dylan’s public persona, including Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has previously rejected criticisms levelled at him of being too middle-class for the role and recalled how his mother worked as a nurse while his father was employed as a factory toolmaker.\u0026nbsp“The idea that somehow I personally don’t know what it’s like for people across the country in all sorts of different circumstances is just not borne out,” he told BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme after the general election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSir Keir draws supporters from across the party and is said to have already convinced enough MPs to back his leadership ambitions. Aware of Labour’s left-leaning membership, who will ultimately decide the next leader, he has been careful not abandon Jeremy Corbyn’s radical policies.\u0026nbsp“What Jeremy Corbyn brought to the Labour Party in 2015 was a change in emphasis - a radicalism that matters, and the rejection of austerity. We need to build on that, rather than oversteer and go back to some bygone age,” he said in December.“The case for a radical government has never been stronger. The shift to a more radical position in 2015 and that rejection of austerity was really important.”He was also a prominent supporter in the shadow cabinet of Labour shifting to back to a pro-Final Say referendum. According to a recent poll of the party’s membership by YouGov, Sir Keir enjoys 31 per cent of first preferences support – 11 per cent ahead his closest rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailThe Salford and Eccles MP entered the race to succeed Mr Corbyn with an article for the left-wing Tribune magazine, vowing to build a “winning vision of a socialist future” and to “go to war with the political establishment”.Ms Long Bailey has repeatedly highlighted her childhood experience of growing up in the shadow of Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium and watching her father worry about job losses as a docker and trade union representative. She worked as a solicitor in her twenties and was a relative newcomer into Labour politics before being elected in 2015 to replace Hazel Blears.\u0026nbsp Considered a protégé of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, she quickly climbed the ranks of Corbyn’s Labour Party before becoming the shadow business secretary in 2017.Since announcing her leadership bid Ms Long Bailey has been described as a “continuity Corbyn” candidate – a label she rejects – after making clear she will stick with Labour’s radical agenda, especially the Green New Deal she claims party strategists “tragically undersold”.\u0026nbsp“I don’t just agree with the policies, I’ve spent the last four years writing them,” she added.Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ms Long Bailey also insisted she would not return to Ed Miliband era of “controls on immigration” being showcased on the side of the Labour Party mugs, adding claims that immigration depresses wages are wrong.\u0026nbspOn Trident, the nuclear deterrent system, which Mr Corbyn refused to say he would use, she said: “If you have a deterrent you have to be prepared to use it.”Ms Long Bailey is widely considered to be one of the top two candidates to succeed Mr Corbyn in April and has already attracted the prominent backing of Ian Lavery. the party chairman who had been mulling his own leadership bid, and that of her close friend Angela Rayner, who is also running for the deputy leadership position. Whether the left-leaning members are enticed by Sir Keir or another left-wing candidate, such as Clive Lewis, however, remains to be seen.\u0026nbspOne of the first contenders to enter the leadership race in the aftermath of the disastrous general election campaign, Clive Lewis said: “I’m standing to leader of the Labour Party for the simple reason that if I don’t, certain necessary truths may go unspoken during the debates of the coming months”.\u0026nbspBefore joining Labour’s parliamentary ranks, Mr Lewis grew up in a council estate in Northampton with his English mother and father, who came to the UK from Grenada, and worked in a good processing factory before becoming a full-time trade union official. Mr Lewis eventually worked as a BBC journalist, and an army reservist, who served in Afghanistan.\u0026nbspIn a recent article for The Independent, Mr Lewis wrote: “My Granddad instilled in me a great sense of civic duty through his stories of fighting the Nazis during the war. He also fostered a sense of black pride and struggle in me, as he taught me about colonial history.\u0026nbsp“My sense of belonging didn’t come from some idealised construct of the past but was created in the present, through the everyday experiences of the people I grew up with. This sense of belonging based on shared values and interests is what I want to bring to our country now.”So far in the contest, Mr Lewis, who was one of the most prominent backers of a second referendum, has backed a shift to proportional representation voting system, reform of the House of Lords and suggested that Labour should “reach out to every progressive force in the country – parties, campaigns and movements – for the biggest conversation possible about how, together, we can change our country for the better”.But given a sizeable proportion of the left-wing MPs’ votes are likely to head in Ms Long Bailey’s direction, it is not yet clear whether Mr Lewis, the shadow treasury minister, will have sufficient support in the Parliamentary Labour Party to make it through to the second round.Announcing her decision to run for Labour leader Emily Thornberry made clear she had been an opponent of an early general election, and warned Jeremy Corbyn’s office it had been an “act of catastrophic political folly”.She was brought up on a council estate near Guildford in Surrey by her mother when her father, a human rights lawyer and academic, walked out on his family. “I was born into the Labour Party,” she once said, claiming she delivered leaflets by the “age I could reach the letter box”. Before being elected as the MP for Islington South and Finsbury in 2005, Ms Thornberry also studied law at Kent University and went on to become a human rights barrister.Ms Thornberry has been loyal to Mr Corbyn – a constituency neighbour – throughout his leadership but, like Sir Keir, was sidelined during the campaign for her vocal support of a second Brexit referendum – and once even dressed up as an EU flag. She has also won plaudits for her performance at the despatch box as shadow foreign secretary and has previously stood in for the Labour leader at prime minister’s questions.On policy, she has previously said there was “nothing” in the manifesto she disagreed with, but rather: “When you put it all together, it did look like we were promising to deliver the earth, the moon and stars”. In recent days, she also attacked Boris Johnson, her former opposite number in the House of Commons, over the Iranian crisis in the aftermath of the killing of Qassem Soleimani.\u0026nbspShe accused the prime minister of “sunning himself, drinking vodka martinis” in the Caribbean instead of dealing with the fallout from the death of the Iranian official.\u0026nbsp She also warned of a “lurch towards war” because of Donald’s Trump’s “reckless decision” to kill one of the most prominent figures in the Iranian regime.It is not yet clear with Ms Thornberry has the required support from Labour MPs to pass through to the next round of the contest. According to polling by YoGov, she also finishes in the bottom two, alongside Lisa Nandy, in terms of Labour members’ first preferences for the next leader of the party.Entering the leadership contest, Jess Phillips declared that politics “needs an honest voice” as she launched a campaign video detailing her community activism in Birmingham over a decade ago.“People want some fairy basic things,” she declared. “They won’t to know that their children can be educated and if they are ill that they will be made better. Those things are radical to great parts of our country at the moment because they simply don’t exist.”Before being elected to parliament in 2015 she worked in women’s refugees, helping victims of domestic abuse, and has since read out the names of those killed by their partners each year in the House of Commons. In an interview with The Sunday Times over the summer, Ms Phillips said she was brought up in a working-class community in Birmingham as her “bearded lefty” father worked as a teacher and healthcare manager.\u0026nbspDuring one recent speech to MPs, she said: “I thought I had met posh people before I came here, but I had actually just met people who eat olives”.Perhaps the most prominent critic of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the party, Ms Phillips has become a high-profile figure in the Labour Party, despite not serving on the frontbench. She has also been vocal of the party’s “woeful response” to antisemitism allegations within its ranks.\u0026nbspShe has been a supporter of a second referendum, but appeared to row back on her suggestion at the weekend that the party could campaign to rejoin the EU under her stewardship if the Brexit proved damaging. \u0026nbspMs Phillips is likely to draw her support in the Parliamentary Labour Party from those who have been critical of Mr Corbyn’s leadership and more moderate-leaning MPs. But given the left-wing persuasion of the party’s membership she faces a monumental challenge if she is to emerge as the next Labour leader in April.The Wigan MP since 2010 officially entered the race several days into the new year, and warned party members that if the party fails to change course “we will become irrelevant”.Launching her campaign in the Wigan Post, she said that without “what were once our Labour heartlands” Labour will never win back power in Westminster.Ms Nandy and former shadow cabinet minister launched the Centre For Towns think tank - something which could give her an advantage in understanding why voters in former industrial Labour heartlands switched to the Tories. She said that too many people no longer feel they have a voice in our national story and did not believe that politicians were interested in what they had to say.Before being elected in 2010, Ms Nandy worked for the youth homelessness charity Centrepoint and The Children\u0027s Society. She grew up in a highly political household: her Indian father, Dipak Nandy, was a Marxist academic, and her grandfather Frank Byers served the Liberal Party in the House of Commons before becoming a life peer. She studied politics at Newcastle University and became a councillor before running for parliament.\u0026nbspMs Nandy, who is often described to be from the “soft left” in the Labour Party, said “trust” was the key issue in why Labour lost the election. Hinting she will stick with key policies of Labour’s manifesto, she said “people felt it was a no-brainer” when talking about the renationalisation of the railways.\u0026nbspBut she added: “When we said that we would offer free broadband, I remember somebody in Leigh saying, “I just want a functioning bus network.”She insisted it was “looking very positive” in regards to getting on the ballot paper during an interview at the weekend, but appears at the bottom of members’ first preferences for the next leader in a recent poll.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Two days before the flight, she sent him a message…”In , authorities first investigated a mystery woman who made a two-minute phone call to the captain of MH, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, shortly before the plane’s take-off, using a pay-as-you-go SIM card that was obtained under a  identity.It was one of the last calls made to or from the Captain’s mobile in the hours before his Boeing  left Kuala Lumpur.In Malaysia, anyone purchasing a PAYG SIM must fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number, under anti-terror measured brought in after the September  Twin Tower attacks.The mobile number was traced to a shop in Kuala Lumpur, and efforts were made to track down the woman who made the call.Authorities feared the phone call was a possible link between Captain Zaharie and terror groups whose members routinely use untraceable SIM cards.It is not yet clearthe two women are the same person or at all linked.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Almost six years after the MH aircraft went missing, the new investigative documentary promises to deliver new compelling evidence – including what the authorities in Australia and Malaysia really knew about the disappearance, and exactly where experts believe the plane’s wreckage can be found.Sky News Australia journalist Peter Stefanovic says Malaysian authorities knew what happened to the plane within a week of it going missing, but covered it up.Stefanovic said: “I will reveal the Malaysian government knew what happened to the plane within a week of it going missing – but continued to look in the wrong areas.”“I will also reveal private conversations held between very senior members of the Australian and Malaysian governments.”In the documentary preview, Stefanovic puts the accusations directly to former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.Malaysian Airlines Boeing  aircraft was carrying  passengers and crew when it vanished in the early hours of March , , while on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.The world was left baffled: how could a modern aircraft simply vanish Almost six years on, MH has become the greatest aviation mystery of all time, with the search for the missing jet becoming the most costly in aviation history.Despite hundreds of millions of dollars being spent by Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities the plane has never been found, sparking anger in the missing passengers’ desperate families.Until now, the most likely scenario explaining the aircraft’s disappearance involved someone in the cockpit of Flight , probably Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, re-programming the aircrafts autopilot to travel south across the Indian Ocean in an act of murder-suicide.It is hoped Sky News Australia’s MH: The Untold Story will spark a reopening of the search for the missing aircraft and the passengers on board to finally answer: What really happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight MH "},{"url":null,"title":"man girlfriend fart texas","story":"Christopher Ragsdale, , has been charged with assault family violence after police responded to a disturbance on Sunday afternoon at a property in Wichita Falls, Texas.When the cops arrived, the victim said they were sitting on a friends couch when Ragsdale allegedly farted and she told him is fart smelled horrible.Police said Ragsdale then grabbed her by the hair and threw her on the ground.He then allegedly sat on his girlfriends back and wrapped his arm around her neck and choked her.Police said Ragdsdale yelled at her and headbutted her after she went to the other room.Ragsdales bond has not yet been set.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Defeat in last month’s ­General Election has left the party’s ranks depleted.The choice of candidates is hardly appetising.If you were talking about Quality Street, you’d say they’re all a bit nutty.Will it be wonkish Sir Keir Starmer, a legal oddball who never blinks, or will it be ­prolier-than-thou Jess Phillips, veering all over the political piste like Austrian ski legend Franz Klammer after lunch Could it be Lady Wobbles  I talk, naturally, of Emily Thornberry, who may or may not be the lovechild of Hattie Jacques and Boris Yeltsin.Her snobbery about White Van Man will probably knock la-di-dah Emily out of the running, although she is probably the one the Tories fear most.What about tough guy Clive Lewis, an unknown fashion dude from East Anglia whose only criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he wasn’t really left-wing enough Wigan lass Lisa Nandy — so earnest she looks asshe could burst into tears at any moment — is also in the contest. Then there is Rebecca Long-Bailey, she of the Mrs Merton spectacles, fanciedby Corbyn’s old Marxist sidekick John McDonnell.Long-Bailey is untested. But so are the others. I was going to shock you by noting that Thornberry, having once been a ministerial aide, is the only candidate to have had a snf of Whitehall experience.Then I realised that she is the only one of them to have actually sat on the governing side in the House of Commons.Nandy became an MP in , when Labour left office.The rest entered the Commons only in .OK, let’s look on the bright side. They should all have a certain novelty value.So how come they feel so unexciting  It’s because they represent old ideas.Tony Blair is nowadays a discredited figure but when he was leader of the Opposition in the s, he did something shrewd.He wrenched his party into the modern era by producing a pledge card with five basic promises. They helped him win a landslide in the  General Election.Blair’s five pledges reflected the electorate’s priorities: Smaller class sizes for primary schools, quicker punishment of young offenders, shorter NHS waiting times, getting younger people off benefits by using a windfall tax on privatised utilities, and a promise not to raise income tax.Blair grasped how Labour was seen by the voters. His pledge card helped address those worries. The policies themselves were only part of the trick. Equally important was the idea that Blair’s Labour was prepared to listen.A quarter of a century on, the next Labour leader should repeat Blair’s trick and be honest about how the party is seen.Here are five basic philosophical pledges that might help to address the problem.PLEDGE : Saving is a virtue. One reason Jeremy Corbyn bombed in last month’s election was that his spending plans were seen as madly extravagant. Voters may not like government “austerity” but they aren’t mugs. They know state spending has to be paid for.If you are a government or an inidual, you can’t live for ever on the never-never.It’s time Labour reacquainted itself with prudence.PLEDGE : Patriotism is honourable. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear a Labour leader say this Yet since the decline of the British Empire, the Left has regarded patriotism as a dirty word. This is electorally crazy.Patriotism is merely an expression of civic pride, of communal values channelled into the identity of the democratic nation state and its Queen.Working-class former Labour voters love American patriotism .They applaud the Aussies and South Africans when they wave their flags.What is so wrong with being proud of Britain PLEDGE : Stable families strengthen us all.I’m not making a point about marital infidelities — MPs are the last people who should preach about sex! — but Labour’s promotion of metropolitan lestyles has created an idea it disapproves of “normal” family set-ups.Add to that its reluctance to give families tax breaks and its strange cultural suspicion of adoption. Former Labour seats are often areas with the strongest notion of traditional family solidarity.A wise leadership candidate would acknowledge that.PLEDGE : Brexit is irreversible. Please. This matter has been settled.And yet that fool Jess Phillips is hinting that she wants us to rejoin the EU. Electoral suicide.PLEDGE : No more jobsworths. Bigger than everything  is the suspicion that officialdom is an ass.The British people are wonderfully tolerant but they are driven mad by petty regulation — particularly when it comes to minority grievances.“Jobsworths” who say that ignoring daft political-correctness is “more than my job’s worth” are the bane of Britain.Who is more intolerant: A provincial baker who hesitates to ice a wedding cake for a gay couple, or the gay couple who take that baker to the High Court to prove a point We all know whose side Labour politicians would have been on.A would-be Labour leader who cheerfully made these pledges would be a Labour leader who could connect with the electoral mainstream.But will any of them do so  Don’t hold your breath.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A survey of , UK people who oversee hiring at their company found it takes them just  seconds to decidesomeoneaposs CV is worth a closer look. Other no-nos include using cliches like aposI always go the extra mileapos and having inexplicable gaps in your career history. More than a third of those polled said that telling an obvious fib on a CV will see it binned, while just over one in  donapost like it when social media handles are included. Shelley Preston, head of Adecco Retail which commissioned the research, said: Your CV is your door opener and it has to be accurate. Recruiters will see dozens -not hundreds - of applications and while itaposs important your CV stands out, you want it to be for the right reasons. The first step is making sure everything is spelt perfectly, because errors like that show youaposre likely to have similar low standards in your career. The study also found just under a tenth of those who hire staff hate layouts which are too complicated to actually read, while one in five would be turned off by a rude or inappropriate email address. And a fth have even been amazed after an applicant got their companyaposs name wrong when applying for the job. However, just under six in  have made an initial negative judgement on a CV, only for the candidate to turn out to be better than expected.  On the other hand, three quarters have had an applicant turn in a brilliant resume, only to be hopeless once theyaposd landed the job, according to the OnePoll research. Half of those polled admitted that a candidate who had a perfectly written CV but didnapost seem like a perfect fit for a job would most likely be invited for an interview anyway. But four in  say a single typo on an otherwise perfect application would hold them back from offering that person an interview. And on average, for every  CVs the average employer looks at, four of them will contain a typo or spelling mistake. The problem could be generational though, as  per cent agree that young people today are more likely to have a aposterribleapos CV, compared to a decade ago. Around half even admitted to having a CV come their way with an error on it so hilarious, they were moved to print it out and show it to their colleagues.  It also emerged one in  experts in perusing job applications describe themselves as aposextremely goodapos at spotting a lie on a CV, and  per cent have called someone out on a fib. As many as four in  of these truth-benders admitted to the hood, while  per cent attempted to blag their way out of the situation.

The Bill, nicknamed the aposWABapos is being rushed through the House of Commons in three days this week to ensure the UK can leave the EU legally by January . But since October itaposs had major changes - including stripping out previous commitments to workers’ rights and forcing the transition period to end on December . That could leave the UK facing a no-deal Brexit on  January there is no trade deal with the EU in time.  The RPC warned those changes - and its own warnings that more assessment was needed - have been ignored. And it said the assessment is “not at the level we would expect to see.” A statement by the RPC said: “The Government have not revised the October IA to reflect either the comments in our October opinion or the changes made to the Bill at its re-introduction to Parliament in December. “Our opinion, therefore, remains that the quality of evidence in the IA is not at the level that we would expect to see in a final stage IA. Shown the statement by the Mirror, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Alistair Carmichael saisd: At every step of the way, the Tories have tried to disguise the damaging and dangerous consequences of their Brexit plans.The Government must stop running away from the  promises that they have made and be honest with the public about what they have in store for them with their hard Brexit plan. This statement from the independent Regulatory Policy Committee demonstrates that the Government has repeatedly refused to provide accurate information, especially on the impact on small businesses, leaving people in the dark. Itaposs about time that Boris Johnson started being honest with our people, rather than hiding the true price of a hard Brexit. What do they have to hide ”Any criticism of the Bill would have been academic in legal terms because Boris Johnson has an -seat majority.That means concerns about workersapos rights and the trapdoor to no-deal Brexit are unlikely to be written out of the law.  The October impact assessment said the Bill would cost a relatively tiny £m over  years - but most costs or impacts were not included. It didnapost count either the £bn orce bill, or the end of billions in payments to Brussels. Not to mention £bn in no-deal planning.Yet at the time, Chancellor Sajid Javid refused to bow to calls for a proper impact assessment.He said: Trust in democracy and bringing an end to the ision that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments.

I thought Corbyn was one of the most honest, kind, principled politicians Iaposve ever met, the shadow business secretary told ITV News as she launched her leadership bid. Iaposd give him  out of , because I respect him and I supported him all the way through. What we canapost ignore was that Jeremy was savaged from day one by the press ... We have a role as party to develop the image of our leader and to put them forward in the most positive way, but we also have a duty to rebut criticism and attacks. As a party we needed to have a rebuttal unit, a clear structure in place to rebut the attacks against him. Speaking at the PLP: The Labour Party, in government, is the most powerful engine for social progress we have in this country. In losing the election we let down the people who rely on us. Our number one duty as Labour MPs is to learn the lessons of defeat and make sure we don’t repeat them.We lost because our compromise position on Brexit was seen by Leavers as an attempt to undo the referendum result, without satisfying Remainers. We lost because too few voters thought Labour spoke for them, and because they didn’t trust us to deal with antisemetism. And we lost because we didn’t do a good enough job at convincing voters that our popular policies were credible and deliverable, or come up with a framing and slogan that could match Johnson’s simple pledge to aposGet Brexit Doneapos. She said win again the party needed a clear and attractive offer that will uny the country and our Party and offered up as an example the Green New Deal she helped author which was a key section of the  manesto. Party chairman Ian Lavery announced he would not be standing and would be backing Ms Long-Bailey last night. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell confirmed that he too would be backing Ms Long Bailey.  The new Labour leader and deputy will be announced at a conference on Saturday April . Sir Keir used an article on the LabourList website to highlight the importance of trade unions to the party. Securing the support of unions could be crucial in the second stage of the Labour leadership battle. Sir Keir said: We did not lose the election because we promised to boost public sector pay, restore collective bargaining, give workers a real say in their workplaces, invest in our public services or end outsourcing to the private sector. We did not lose because we believe public services like the railways should be in public hands rather delivering profits for shareholders. In an apparent effort to reassure the left of the party that he could be trusted, Sir Keir said there could be no sacricing our core principles and no over-steering or accepting the Tory narrative. We are a party and a movement that opposes austerity, supports common ownership and believes in public services, he said. In addition to Ms Long-Bailey and Sir Keir, four other candidates have announced they intend to stand for the leadership - frontbenchers Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis, and backbenchers Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy. Former Cabinet minister Yvette Cooper and Sheffield City Region mayor Dan Jarvis both ruled out leadership bids.

When the exit poll was announced it was devastating. We had let down millions of people across the country who desperately need a Labour Government. Time after time I have said we need to learn the lessons from election defeats - and Iaposm fed up saying it. The Labour Party must change so that people across the country can trust us once again. I’m standing to be deputy leader of the Labour Party because I want to help us win power to transform lives. That’s why I joined the Labour party: to change our country. Growing up on the Wester Hailes council estate in Edinburgh, in a family that worked as coopers and slaughtermen, I was taught to be three things: a patriotic Scot a passionate Hearts football club fan and a defender of the Labour movement. It’s a combination that has brought unbridled joy and uncontrollable tears in equal measure over the years. When my dad died suddenly at the age of  I was just nine-years-old. My mum was left with two young boys to look after, and I don’t think I ever appreciated how hard she worked to keep us afloat. To the Tory Government of the day, families like ours didn’t deserve support. But my mum and my teachers told me and my brother there was nothing we couldn’t achieve. I want that hope and aspiration for every child. That’s what the Labour Party can deliver when it’s in power. But today we are on the opposition benches in the Commons, in danger of drting into irrelevance. We need ambition, strength and couragewe are to stand a chance of survival. I know what it takes to beat the odds.  I worked as a kitchen porter and went on to run my own pubs. I grew up on a council estate and went to Edinburgh University at the age of  as the first in my family to go to university. I helped rescue my beloved football club from extinction by leading the fans’ foundation. And in politics I have defended my seat against a wave of populist nationalism that swept away all my Labour colleagues in Scotland… twice. I know how to win by building broad coalitions of support from all parties and none. To win again, we will need to beat the odds, and they are stacked against us. But we can change themwe make the right choices and be honest with ourselves and the public. The architects of the party’s catastrophic failure in  cannot be allowed to be the architects of the response. The next leadership team must turn us into an election-winning machine that uses the skills and talents of all our members and supporters to succeed. There are four ways I want to see us do that. Firstly, we must listen to and reconnect with voters in the seats we lost, as well as those who abandoned us in the seats we hold. We must also listen to those in seats we will never win and build our response from there. With Scotland’s voice at the top of the party we can send a strong message that we are listening to all the nations and regions that want to be heard, and that the entire party can learn from Scotland where populist nationalism had its first victory in the UK. Second, we must be clear about where we stand on the key issues of the day. Voters don’t want politicians to agree with them all the time – they want us to have the debate and try to convince them. On the major constitutional issues of our time – Scottish independence and Brexit – we must be clear with people where we stand. We should always be a pro-EU and pro-UK party because it is not just in the national interest, but part of our values. We must show leadership and strength to make and win those arguments. Third, we must reform our organisation. As deputy leader I would launch a review of our organisation – working alongside members and party staff – to understand the mistakes that were made and how we can fix them for the future. The current party organisation should not be changed until the new leadership team is in place. Finally, we need an open and inclusive policy process to lead us to Labour’s next manesto. I believe Labour can win again, but we will only turn this roundwe don’t dwell on the past and instead look to the future.

The -year-old, who has not been named, arrived at Cyprusaposs Larnaca airport with her parents this afternoon in order to fly back to the UK. The Derbyshire woman was given a suspended sentence at Famagusta District Court after she was found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Ayia Napa. She was given a second chance and spared immediate jail today after being convicted of public mischief last month. A judge took into account her age -  at the time of the offence - and her psychological state before sentencing the woman to four monthsapos in jail, suspended for three years.  Her lawyer Lewis Power QC said her legal team would be challenging her conviction and were prepared to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

We will be going home today. The court heard the teenager had endured more than five months of hell in a jail in Cyprus since allegations she lied about the gang-rape emerged.  She had strenuously denied the charge of public nuisance. But speaking after the verdict today, the teenaposs defence team added: This young woman has shown immense bravery, courage and fortitude in coming forward. Her identity has been compromised she has been trolled viciously on social media and has been subjected to vile comments. Some of those who perpetrated this serious sexual assault ed to their homeland bragging triumphantly and unashamedly as to what they had done to her, compounding her trauma. This teenager remains determined to achieve justice and myself and the whole defence team share the same determination. We as a civilised society cannot allow this “ blame the victim culture” to continue and let the perpetrators go unpunished. This is the greatest injustice of all.  The treatment of the teenager caused international outrage when it was announced by Judge Michalis Papathanasiou that she could face jail on December . His actions angered womenaposs groups and even expert witnesses in the case as it emerged the distressed teenager had come under pressure from police to retract her original statement.

A huge mass of earth and sand the size of “a couple of football pitches” plunged onto the beach overnight. Police and the council are now warning walkers to stay away from the area, which is dangerously unstable. Tony Garbutt, operations manager at HM Coastguard, said: We are looking at a good half acre falling, about the size of a couple of football pitches. “Some of the caravans are very close to the edge. Weaposve disconnected the utilities and weaposre pulling the caravans that were closest to the edge back. This coast is unstable and weaposre not going to be able to stop that. The beach below the clf has been blocked with areas of rubble measuring m high. Mr Garbutt added: It becomes a bit like quicksand and people can get stuck.”  Pete Revell, rescue officer from the local Coastguard, revealed a smaller section of clf collapsed nearby following heavy rain in December. He added: I thought it was big last time, but this is about three times as big. It has gone right into the sea. We donapost want anyone going near the beach at all.  The collapse happened at Trimingham House Caravan Park near Mundesley, Norfolk, overnight between Sunday and Monday. No one was hurt but a woman living in one of the affected caravans has been evacuated. She is understood to be living with relatives. The Norfolk and Suffolk coastline is among the UKs fastest eroding, with many areas losing an average of m of land annually.

But while she got bigger, her twin sister Jodi stayed a size   from teenhood. They always thought of me as ‘the big one’ and I hated that. I wished they were thinking ‘she’s the thin one’ about me and not my twin, Ky, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said today. “I was at my boyfriend’s house when his dad took a picture but didn’t show it to me. It wasn’t until a couple of weeks later when we were going through his phone looking for a dferent photo that I saw it and couldn’t believe it. “All I could think was how tight the top I was wearing looked. I hardly recognised myself, it just really shocked me to see myself the size I was. “That was when I thought, something’s got to change. This time next year I’m not going to look like that.” So the retail assistant joined Slimming World and, in the  months since, has lost five stone. Now she weighs a trim st lb, sheaposs a slender size  and eats healthier.  Ky added: Before I stuck to baggy clothes and it used to get me down that I couldn’t wear all the nice things that everyone  seemed to be wearing. “My sister could always wear the clothes I wanted to wear which really upset me and it definitely affected my confidence. Now I’m always buying clothes and taking photos of myself to post on social media and lots of people don’t recognise me anymore. “When they see me, and how much weight I’ve lost, it’s such a shock to them. And having spent most of my le being the fatter twin, I’m actually the thinner one at last.  But she concedes her lestyle was hugely dferent when she piled on the pounds. I was just eating all the wrong things and I just didn’t know when to stop. I’d have a meal in the evening with my sister and mum and then carry on eating afterwards. I’d think, I’ll just have one or two biscuits, but the whole pack would be gone by the end of the night, Ky continued. Jodi has never struggled with her weight, so my mum would buy chocolates and sweets for her but then hide them in the house to keep them away from me. She was trying to help me be more healthy, but I’d always search the top of the cupboards and manage to find them, no matter where she’d put them.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA seven-year-old girl has undergone surgery to remove a sibling foetus with arms and legs attached to her back. Doctors removed the foetus from the youngster and confirmed they could make out “fuzzy outlines” of a head and limbs. The unidentied schoolgirl was born by Caesarean as a twin - but it now emerges that an unusual medical defect had caused the embryo of an unnoticed triplet to be embedded inside her. Such exceptionally rare cases normally involve twins and are usually noticed at birth with the undeveloped embedded foetus being removed. But in this case in Kazakhstan the third foetus remained inside the child, gradually growing, and causing worsening spinal problems for the girl. By the time her parents - from a remote village - took her to surgeons in Almaty at the age of seven, the foetus, known as a teratoma, was the size of a human fist causing a swelling in her lower back and upper buttock. “The teratoma was covered with membrane in which the foetus was located,” explained Dr Alibek Zharasov, deputy head doctor of Childrenaposs City Hospital No.  in Almaty. The medics were unable to see the sex of the unborn and non-viable triplet but it was assumed to be a sister. The girl, who carried her sibling, was found to be clear of cancer or other serious condition, said the surgeon. “The parents were perhaps afraid of seeing doctors,” said Dr Zharasov. “We don’t know true reason they delayed seeking medical help for this teratoma and getting it treated.” Had the lump not been removed “it could have developed into a dangerous tumour,” he said.  He confirmed the girl - who underwent surgery late last year - was not in danger and had suffered no complications. He was accompanied by three other surgeons in undertaking the unusual operation - Dr Marat Rabandiyarov, Dr Azamat Zhailganov, and Dr Marat Kaptagaev. Dr Zharasov, , said no genetic or others tests have been conducted on the removed sibling carried by the seven year old. “We were interested to establishthe tumour was dangerous for the child, and the nature of it,” he said. “Now we know its not, we do not need further tests.” Such cases - known as foetus in foetu- occur in twins but the Kazakh doctors are unaware of any previous case involving a triplet.  Inside the womb, one foetus wraps around the other. The enveloped foetus becomes a parasite depending on the host unborn child’s blood supply. It has no brain and is unable to survive on its own andnot removed by surgery after birth, it grows slowly inside its twin. In  there was another startling case in Kazakhstan, involving a boy, also aged seven. He became known as “the boy who gave birth to his twin” when surgeons operated on his distended stomach that made him look pregnant. Inside him they found a large, oval mass covered in veins, each connected to blood vessels, with limbs, nails and male genitals.

The democratic services officer, , from London, was left distraught by the death of charity champion Tommy Blackmore, who died from a single punch after breaking up a fight in June . Tragically, her grief was compounded when she lost her dad Eddie to cancer just over a year later.  The new Islander’s heartbreak began when her friend Tommy died after stepping in to break up an argument outside a nightclub near Tower Bridge. The -year-old had been out partying before being caught up in the “wrong place at the wrong time”. Friends desperately tried to save him after the attack in June  as he lay unconscious in the street but he later passed away. Following his death, Shaughna uploaded a sweet pic of the pair, and paid tribute: Hoping this is all a nightmare and I wake up soon... I cannot put into words how much of a p*** take this boy is, he would do anything to be mischievous and I cannot believe Iaposm not going to be experiencing another one of his pranks again. I am actually heartbroken. Hope youaposre okay with the Angels Tom, love you and miss you.  She was amongst the huge crowds gathered at his funeral earlier to pay their respects to Tommy, who raised more than £, for Cancer Research UK. Alongside a picture capturing the huge crowd of mourners, she wrote: “A send off fit for a king! “Today was one of the hardest days of my le, saying goodbye to a very dear friend. Love you, Iaposll see you again boy.”    In September , Lloyd Smythe, then , was jailed for five-and-a-half years for manslaughter. The Old Bailey heard Smythe punched Mr Blackmore because he wrongly believed he had smashed his mobile phone. The following year, in December , Shaugna revealed that her dad Eddie had passed away from cancer.  In a moving tribute, she vowed to make her father proud in the future, writing: “My brave, amazing daddy passed away this morning at :am. “He has spent the past  days completely pain free, surrounded by all of his closest friends and family. “My mama hasnapost left his side once, and all of the stories and memories that have been spoken about have shown me itaposs okay to smile. “Cancer may have taken my dad but it cannot take the past  years away from me, and his love will stay with me forever. Me and my dad had loads of chats the past few months, and any promise I made to him will be fulfilled, I bet my le on it. “I will make that man so proud, I feel so robbed that my children will never meet their grandad, but they will be reminded every single day of just how special theirangel is.  “I asked you to come back and see me, so Iaposll be waiting daddy. Let me know youaposre okay. Iaposll miss you until the day we meet again big man. Love your little girl.” A year later, she got her dadaposs signature tattooed on his arm - alongside a line from a poem he had written.On Instagram , she shared: My dad hated tattoos and said he would never let me get one, so it was only right I didnapost listen to him and went and got one with his signature on it. The other day I was looking through my old paper work, and found one of my dads old poem lyrics book from . As I was going through it, the last poem he wrote finished with the sentence Hanging out in the clouds under the moon signed Eddie . Thataposs exactly where you are now my angel, and whenever Iaposm struggling, I only need to look down to remind myself. New Islander Shaughna will join  other islanders heading into the villa.

Not only are they a joy to look at, their kind nature also means they are likely to be the goodest boys and girls you will ever have the pleasure of meeting. So it came as a bit of a surprise to thousands on the internet when actor and comedian Andy Richter shared an MRI scan of his friendaposs dog to discover that manaposs best friend was downright aposterryingapos on the inside. And although many found amusement in scan of the poor little pug, a vet has said it also highlights the concerning results of selective breeding which have a detrimental impact on the health of the breed.Andy tweeted the image from the scan showing the dogaposs signature bulging eyes with the caption: aposMy friendaposs pug went to the vetapos.Itaposs attracted more than , likes, with many left in stitches by the results. One replied: This made me laugh uncontrollably for two minutes straight. Another said: Amazing. Pugs may be the only creature to look exactly the same in X-Ray as in visible light. Some were slight unsure, with a third writing: That is simultaneously the cutest and most terrying thing I have seen in my entire le. Thank you for the happy nightmares this image will bring me tonight.  After the tweet went viral, Andy added an update to let everyone know that the pug was given a clean bill of health and was aposnonplussedapos by its new found fame.Rory Cowlam, a vet based in London, told the Independent that although most MRI images, including those taken of humans, would look unusual to the untrained eye, he conceded the pugaposs snapshot was apospretty odd lookingaposDr Cowlam said: Their faces have been shortened due to intensive breeding by humans, unfortunately.  They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses - the condition is called brachycephalism. We have, through human selection, bred them to look more like a human baby because we find that cute, but unfortunately that cute look is not very good for the animal. With other breeds including French bulldogs and Shih Tzus also suffering from the same condition, Dr Cowlam said he would aposactively encourageapos prospective owners to think again about buying animals with brachycephalism.

That was a dficult time.“We’ve had loads of ups and downs but the past year is certainly one, for the first half of it anyway, we want to put behind us as quickly as possible.“With the recent bit of form and positivity, we take that into  and kick on.”Dundee start the year with three home matches on the bounce, firstly against potential play-off rivals Caley Thistle and Ayr United before they welcome high-flying Premiership side Motherwell to Dens Park for a Scottish Cup tie.“We have dficult games coming up.

That’s not being arrogant or cocky but what Dundee should be aiming for.“There needs to be a realisation of how good this squad can be.”And Kerr says the second half against league leaders United last Friday gives everyone associated with the club belief they can start looking upwards.“There was a wee realisation after the game we could have taken three points.“The boys have spoken since and we’re starting to realise how well we can do as a team.“After we got the goal at Tannadice, there was a belief on the pitch and I think the fans felt that.“Even when the board went up for how long was left, the fans still thought we could win it.“Hopefully, that is a wee turning point for us – it needs to be going forward.“There has been a lot of disappointment, a lot of games where we have huffed and puffed throughout the season.“Last Friday, the fans came again in their numbers and I didn’t expect there to be so many, to be honest.“United had three of the stands but our fans were so loud again and when we scored it was great to go and celebrate with them.“Our fans have had to endure a dficult year, especially with United being on top since day one.“We are happy with how it went but, at the same time, we need to make sure we don’t rest on a draw – we need to remember we didn’t win – but use it to kick us on.”Dundee have faced the Caley Jags three times this season, winning -, drawing - and losing - last time in Inverness.Dundee United - Dundee: Dorrans# first goal earns Dee derby point\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united---dundee-dorrans-first-goal-earns-dee-derby-point embed # secretynOUlpvmC\" data-secret\"ynOUlpvmC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Kerr added: “We are under no illusions how tough it will be tomorrow.

However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e0f531a474512.80393139-940x540.jpg ","title":"mcpake laments poor dee display","story":"Dundee manager James McPake believes their - defeat to Inverness at Dens on Saturday was as poor as they’ve been all season.The Dark Blues went down with a whimper to the Caley Jags as first-half goals from Aaron Doran and James Keatings had the game over as a contest after  minutes.And boss James ranks the loss up there with the - derby defeat to rivals Dundee United and the - capitulation against Partick at Dens.Askedhis side struggle to find he right levels at home, the Dee gaffer said: “No, I don’t think so.“You can pick games at home and away from home where we’ve been really good so it’s about being the way we are when we’re good and getting after teams.Dundee - Inverness CTGoals from Aaron Doran and @jameskeatings give nd placed Inverness CT victory at Dens Park against Dundee.@ICTFC @DundeeFC @spfl pic oCfXziEkmdash Sky Sports ScotlandJanuary , “On Saturday, for that first  minutes, it was as poor as we’ve been all season so I can’t even look at the other games where we have been poor.“We started the game really badly on Saturday and I don’t think it’s got anything to do with where we’re playing.“We just never came out the blocks the way we should’ve on the back of a half-decent run.”And that lack of momentum carried over from the - derby draw at Tannadice the weekend previous, given they were also on a four-match unbeaten run, surprised James.He added: “There should have been .“We were on the back of a half-decent run of form and I mean that with the consistency of our performances.“It looked like we knew what we were going to get over the past month or so in terms of the performance.“The energy and the drive in the team wasn’t there on Saturday.“Inverness were the opposite.

around","story":"Almost , residents across Aberdeen have been supported by an innovative new scheme to deal with non-medical issues.Aberdeen Health and Social Care Partnershiplaunched the link practitioner programme in September .All the city’s  GP practices have had a link practitioner assigned to them.The scheme, which saw , referrals and is regarded as the biggest in Scotland, signposts patients at GP surgeries to services they may find beneficial and helps them to gain the support which could get their lives back on track.New data from September   to November   shows the highest proportion of patients were referred for mental health reasons, with a total of  referralsciting it as their primary referral reason.This was followed by  patientswho felt isolated and who wanted advice on benefits.Dr Alasdair Jamieson, lead GP at Cove and Kincorth Medical Practice, credits the scheme for delivering “signicant improvements” in both the quality and depth of support offered.He added: “They can give a bit more time than we as GPs can give.“Some of the patients are very vulnerable, perhaps with confidence issues, who might struggle to take the first steps into their support.“The link practitioner will explore what might help and maybe hold hands a little bit.”Although the scheme might not work for everyone, Dr Jamieson claims it has helped “many people” to “turn their lives around”.He added: “It’s given them the support to start to get back on their feet.”A newly released report into the scheme has claimed the service appears to contribute to reducing the number of GP contacts and has the “potential” to alleviate pressures on primary care.Support offered during the scheme ranged from those who required a single telephone call or appointment, to those requiring more extensive support including multiple face-to-face appointments, home visits and support to attend community groups.Senior link practitioner Jenny Wooley is currently working at Marywell Health Centre but has been based at sites across Aberdeen City.She said: “My role as a practitioner means I deliver support to people who present at the GP with a wide iety of issues, including social dficulties and financial problems, and point them in the right direction of groups or organisations that can help.“Anyone who presents at a health centre with challenges beyond their health get referred to us and we work either short-term or long-term with them to make sure they get the right support.“Since we started in September , we have had almost , referrals and supported GP practices across the city.“We have improved le quality, decreased social isolation and increased community connectivity so far in Aberdeen.“I hope we continue to improve this as well as provide connected and improved choices over the next few years and also decrease GP appointment waiting times.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49207084-240x180.jpg

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

Caroline and Duncan were parents to Calum, who sadly passed away aged  after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Knowing he and his family lived in a beautul part of the world, Calum wanted children suffering from cancer to come to Bute for special getaways where the entire family could cherish quality time together and recharge their batteries for what may lie ahead.The charity now runs several holiday homes on Bute and private flats in Glasgow for families travelling to the city for treatments at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Care and Royal Hospital for Children.Dumfries House Lodge is a -room, five-star country guest house with two self-catering cottages, all staffed round the clock.Eight families have been referred through the children#s charity so far to enjoy a four-night stay free of charge.Caroline said: #To allow Calum#s Cabin families to be helped in such a special way is an absolute honour. For many of the families who have had this opportunity, their conditions would have been too severe to get away on holiday, or to come to Bute, so Dumfries House is perfect. Sadly for some, it has been their final holiday together.#The families have been blown away by their stays at Dumfries House.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

He must be the most patient man alive, almost a social media saint. Watch him calmly respond to vilication and abuse every time he points out that taxes raised in Scotland could not sustain public spending, were Scotland to become independent tomorrow.Scotland has a nominal deficit of several billions of pounds which could cause immediate fiscal belt-tighteningthe Barnett taps were turned off. I say nominal because there is much controversy over Haguersquos figures.However, he won a signicant victory last year when the Scottish Government largely accepted, in the Sustainable Growth Commission, his arguments about Scotlandrsquos fiscal position, based as they are on the GERS calculations of Government spending and revenues.Nicola Sturgeon now accepts that independence will involve short-term spending restraint. Thatrsquos better than long-term decline under Westminster rule, she says. Yoursquod think that this admission would have damaged the SNPrsquos electoral standing, but the reverse is true. Last month they enjoyed another landslide victory.So herersquos the puzzle: why have Scottish voters not punished the SNP for agreeing that independence could mean, at the very least, a period of economic dislocation and public spending cuts  The Growth Commission numbers suggest that SNP promises of more cash for the NHS and social care, a costly new benefits system, compensation for Waspi women, electrication of transport and many other spending commitments would be hard to achieve.At the very least taxes would have to rise. But Scottish voters donrsquot seem particularly worried. This is because they are bothered about something more important than deficits. Brexit shows that when it comes to issues of sovereignty and identity, it isnrsquot ldquothe economy, stupid. Rarely has a political axiom been so comprehensively disproved. It clearly isnrsquot the economy that has been driving events in the UK.Looking back over the past three turbulent years, itrsquos obvious that Remainers had the best arguments. If you regard Brexit, as Hague would, as a purely economic exercise in cost-benefit analysis, it stinks. Leaving the largest and wealthiest free trade area on the planet is almost impossible to justy on narrow economic terms.There will almost certainly be a quick and dirty free trade deal negotiated in  that will remove tarfs on goods. But % of UK trade is in non-physical services. There is bound to be an increase in non-tarf barriers to British trade with the single market which will affect UK businesses. That is why so many financial companies have already been setting up shop in Dublin to operate within the rules of the EU single market.Supply chains will be disrupted, which is why car manufacturers were so opposed to Brexit. There have been problems on the high street this Christmas with the shortage of casual labour. The departure of EU citizens is likely to damage education, agriculture manufacturing and services, especially care services.Left-wing Remainers tried to claim that in some way it was billionaires who were behind Brexit, but this was never the case. Remain was, is, a thoroughly pro-capitalist, pro-business case, vigorously pursued and financed by the largest corporate interests, from car manufacturers to banks.Gina Miller is no socialist. Nor is the governor of the Bank of England, the head of Goldman Sachs, or the bosses of Jaguar Land Rover and Honda. It was a handful of pub-chain capitalists, such as Tim Martin of Wetherspoon, who backed Brexit. They are essentially English nationalists who think that Brexit is in some way a declaration of independence.Brexit, as they saw it, was about winning freedom from unelected Brussels bureaucrats and letting Britain stand strong in the world. Irsquod say thatrsquos nonsense, of course. It was never clear that membership of the single market involved a diminution of British sovereignty, even though much trade legislation had been ceded to Brussels. But economic rationality is really not the point.Brexit was essentially an argument about democracy and nationalism. As the General Election has shown, for millions of voters the economy, finance and fiscal policy had very little to do with their political priorities. Remainers were comprehensively defeated because they appeared to do down Britain and ignored the will of the people. Brexit had won the referendum, and no amount of economic reality was going to change votersrsquo minds.The Scottish Government loathes Brexit, and for very good reasons. Scots did not vote to leave the European Union for a start. But in the longer term, Brexit is very good news for the SNP. No matter what arguments unionists such as Hague deploy in future about Scotlandrsquos deficit, it will surely not determine whether or not Scotland leaves the UK.There are three immediate reasons why the Scottish deficit does not, at present, deter people from voting SNP. The Scottish Government has managed the finances of Holyrood reasonably competently over the past decade. There is great scepticism about spending arguments, which voters tend to dismiss as Project Fear.Thirdly, departure from the UK would not happen overnight, and there would be complex financial and trading negotiations before the Union was dissolved.But forget all that, because the urge for freedom trumps any argument over a few billions in tax revenues. Scottish voters know, intuitively, that Scotland is a relatively wealthy country, better off than most regions of England. Labour productivity is comparable to the UK average. Scotland has prodigious natural resources and a highly educated workforce. Scotland has the national income of Portugal and the population of Slovakia.Thatrsquos all they need to know. Indeed, were I advising the SNP, Irsquod say they should stop agonising about currency, fiscal transfers and deficits. What will defeat those arguments is not more numbers, but the emotional appeal to national identity that won Boris Johnson his election victory.Scots did not vote to leave the European Union. They did not vote to lose their EU citizenship, with all the protections that brings.

In the gardens are for example , masses of Gunnera manicata from Brazil, like enormous clumps of rhubarb beneath which not just children, but adults too can shelter...Sir James died in  and was buried on Gigha. He left some of his collection to the National Trust for Scotlandso that his special plants could be conserved.The community-led Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust , which bought the island in , is now in discussion with the NTS over how best to proceed with a restoration plan.IGHT Chairman Ian Wilson said: ldquoWe are actively seeking funding not just to restore Achamore Gardens, but to take them forward for future generations. We want to find somebody with the experience, knowledge, energy and enthusiasm to help the community achieve its goal.An NTS spokesperson said ldquoThe National Trust for Scotland has had a long relationship with Achamore Garden, Isle of Gigha and its successive owners, beginning with Sir James Horlick who bought the site in .\"The Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust, which took over the garden as part of the community buy-out in , is currently working with the NTS to explore options for its future sustainability.In the th century around  people lived on the island but that had dropped to around  by the end of the the last century. Within four years of the buyout the population had increased by more than -per cent to , reversing  years of decline.Although people have come and gone, the IGHT has been successful in retaining that population.But Gigha is not immune to the demographic pressures facing communities. Some , more than half of the  residents, are now over  years and  of them are over  years.Brandon Clements, then , in March became a director of the island trustrsquos board, determined to act before the statistics worsen, and believes his own experience can help.The trust bought the island off previous owner Derek Holt for just over poundm. It repaid a poundm loan to the Scottish Land Fund, over  years ago, as part of a pound.m support package. The IGHTrsquos portfolio of assets has been valued at pound.m.But after  years of struggle, it was reported last year to be in pound.m in debt.Despite having poundmillion of taxpayersrsquo cash lavished on its , acres, including well over poundmillion on bringing up to scratch the dozens of homes successive lairds allowed to fall into disrepair, Gigharsquos dream has turned into a financial nightmare.Gigha is situated three miles west of the Kintyre peninsula, less than three hourrsquos drive from Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"scotts-bbc1-scotland-episode-one-review","story":"BBCScotland, .pmCREATING a sitcom has to one of the toughest gigs in television, up there with being Piers Morganrsquos co-host and Andrew Neilrsquos hair stylist.

Wersquove listened and will now deliver.ldquoWith this Budget we will unleash Britainrsquos potential uniting our great country, opening a new chapter for our economy and ushering in a decade of renewal, he added.The Chancellor will brief his senior colleagues at this morningrsquos Cabinet before taking Treasury Questions in the Commons, where he will underline the Governmentrsquos commitment to help tackle the cost of living for hard-working people and make good on the commitment to level up and spread opportunity, including by investing billions of pounds across the UK.At the Budget, Mr Javid will update the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility with new rules, taking advantage of low interest rates to invest properly and responsibly, while keeping debt under control.The Treasury made clear the Budget would ldquoprioritise the environment and build on recent announcements to boost spending on public services and tackle the cost of living, by investing in new hospitals, training thousands of new police officers, funding vocational education and giving the biggest ever cash increase to the National Living Wage.During the General Election campaign the Chancellor made a decisive break from the policies adopted by his predecessors, promising to loosen constraints on borrowing to the tune of up to pound billion a year for capital spending.Promising an \"infrastructure revolution\" in his first Budget, Mr Javid indicated there would be up to pound billion available for \"transformative\" projects across the country over the coming years.In response to the Budget announcement, Labourrsquos John McDonnell said: \"After a decade of wrecking the economy, we can have no confidence in a Tory Government delivering the scale of investment needed for renewal especially with a no-deal Brexit still on the table.\"The lack of foresight in not focusing this Budget on the threat of climate change is also criminally irresponsible. The Government has learnt nothing from the fires in Australia and the floods on Indonesia.\"This will be a budget of climate change recklessness not renewal,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-investing-fossil-fuel-firms-not-immoral-seems","story":"The countryrsquos deputy prime minister Michael McCormack may have been right when he said ldquowersquove had fires in Australia since time began, but the scale and the intensity of this yearrsquos blazes have been beyond anything anyone has witnessed before. Having first taken hold in September, the fires have so far burnt through five million hectares of land, destroyed thousands of homes, claimed  human lives and killed an estimated  million animals. To say it has been devastating would be the understatement of the year.And while the consensus is that not every extreme weather event can be blamed on climate change, Dr Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre, noted that with the average temperature in Australia now running around one degree higher than the long-term figure, fire seasons are starting earlier and ldquothe cumulative fire danger is growing. Or, as University of Sydney ecologist Professor Glenda Wardle put it, while not every weather event is the direct result of rising temperatures, ldquowhen you see trends it becomes undeniably linked to global climate change.So why the reticence from Australiarsquos leaders to name the issue, too  Back in November Mr McCormack caused outrage when he dismissed climate concerns as the obsession of ldquoraving inner-city lefties, while prime minister Scott Morrison continues to defend carbon-emissions policies that are widely held to be inadequate for a G member. The reason would seem plain for all to see, with the opportunity for Australia to expand its lucrative role as a leading exporter of fossil fuels apparently making the science just too easy to ignore.It is an unforgivable stance to take, and one that is entirely out of step with the general direction of travel. Indeed, at a time when local and national governments around the world have declared a climate emergency, the onus is on all of us to do our bit to avert the crisis. The younger generation has risen to the challenge, taking to the streets to shame policymakers into taking action. Older generations are making changes too, dumping fossil-fuel companies from their investment portfolios and putting pressure on employers to eliminate them from their pensions.It is not just small investors who are taking more of an interest in what their money is funding, with more and more institutional investors starting to question the moral legitimacy of channelling funds into companies whose activities are contributing to the destruction of the planet. Environmental organisation , which aims to ldquoend the age of fossil fuels, says more than , asset managers, pension funds and insurers have pledged to take such action, the aim being to ldquoremove [companiesrsquo] social licence to operate.The Church of England, which has an pound. billion investment pot at its disposal, is one such investor. In  the churchrsquos General Synod voted by  to four to est its holdings in fossil-fuel companies, with a spokesperson saying at the time that the vote made clear that the church ldquomust play a leading role and exercise its moral leadership on the urgent issue of climate change. Attempts are being made to see the Church of Scotland follow suit. Although last May its General Assembly narrowly rejected a motion that would have seen it disinvest from oil and gas companies, Rev Dr Richard Frazer, convener of the Church and Society Council, has said it must now take action ldquoas a matter of urgency.Writing in The Herald last month, he said the council believes that ldquofor reasons of conscience and out of an urgent necessity to respond to what is happening to our planet, we must accelerate the process of weaning ourselves off our dependence on fossil fuels. ldquoIn taking this decision we have approved a report which we will be commending to next yearrsquos General Assembly, recommending that the Church sells its shares in oil and gas companies as a matter of urgency, he wrote.Yet while Dr Frazer stressed that the council had made its decision based on its deeply held belief that Christians have ldquoa duty to care for Godrsquos earth, will the Kirk actually be able to fulfil that dutyit washes its hands of those companies completely  Surely it would do more good by retaining its investments and using its position as a high-profile investor to drive positive change from within It is certainly the opinion of mega-investor Bill Gates that estment programmes are all but pointless, with the removal of even large sums of money unlikely to have enough of an impact to make oil or gas giants change course. Others, such as Japanrsquos . trillion national pension fund, prefer to engage with the companies they invest in, using their clout as major shareholders to hold management teams to account. It is the right approach: while no amount of engagement will stop a fossil-fuel company being a fossil-fuel company, these businesses like any other can and should be forced to set and achieve emissions-reduction targets.It is worth noting that while the Church of England has sold out of positions in tar sands and thermal coal businesses, it retains large investments in oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Crucially, it has started voting against the re-election of chairmen of companies such as EOG Resources for doing too little to combat climate change. It is exactly the kind of activism that is needed.Ultimately, while it is clear that carbon emissions from fossil fuels are causing the planet to warm, the only way for fossil-fuel companies to be driven out of existence is for everyone to stop using fossil fuels. As that is not likely to fully happen for many years ndashever ndash it is better that investors like the Church of Scotland use their boardroom influence to ensure those businesses are contributing to the solution rather than just blaming them for creating the problem.It may seem counterintuitive, but the climate crisis will never be solvedeveryone simply stands shouting from the sidelines."},{"url":null,"title":"one-day-little-womens-jo-might-real-equality","story":"Throughout Greta Gerwigs radical new adaptation of Little Women, female economic and social power are questioned and explored, as are the ious effects of marriage on a womans le.What has changed, from then until now Here is Marmee, taking on the unpaid caring role for the entire town.Here is Meg, her domestic labours undermined and undervalued by her husband.Here is Jo, determined to be an independent, single woman, to \"paddle my own canoe\" but being pressured into marriage, questioned relentlessly about why she doesnt want to have a relationship.\"You remind me of myself,\" Marmee tells Jo, following Jos failure to keep a grip on her explosive temper.\"But youre never angry,\" Jo replies.\"Im angry nearly every day of my le,\" Marmee says. And such a lot she had to be angry about, and such a lot we still have to be angry about, particularly when it comes to men and womens equality in relationships.In one furious scene, Laurie, the March sisters neighbour and close friend, has had his marriage proposal rejected by Jo and is now moping around Paris, drinking his grandfathers money and behaving like a spoiled child.He attempts to give Amy a dressing down for her desire to marry into money she is, at that point in the film, awaiting a proposal. Amy will have none of it. There is no way, she tells Laurie, for a woman to earn her own keep. When she marries she will be the property of her husband any property she owns or money she might earn, will be the property of her husband any children she might have will be the property of her husband. Marriage removes a womans legal right to herself.\"Donrsquot sit there,\" she flares at Laurie, \"And tell me that marriage isnrsquot an economic proposition.\"There is the most obvious change between then and now. Women now earn their own keep. Their children belong to them, their property belongs to them. These are changes made more recently than its comfortable to think about, but they are changes the March girls would be astounded by.Marriage was a system designed to control and subdue women, and to limit their economic power.But marriage is still an economic proposition. Marriage comes with great financial risk for women. They are more likely, when children enter the equation, to give up full time work and so limit their earning potential and their pension contributions.According to the Chartered Insurance Institute, the average orced woman has less than a third of the pension wealth of the average orced man.Repeated studies have shown that the benefits of marriage for men far outweigh the benefits for women. Married men are likely to be in better physical and mental health than their single counterparts, have more money and have greater social support networks.For women, there is very little dference in these measures between single and married women, apart from money, where non-married women are better off. Other studies have shown that married women report lower satisfaction levels than co-habiting or single women and are more likely to initiate orce than men.In Louisa May Alcotts Little Women, Jo quits her writing and is married off, a decision Alcott, who never married, said she regretted. Jo should have remained a \"literary spinster\". In Gerwigs film, Jo is given a book.\"What I was trying to reverse-engineer,\" she said. \"Was this moment that Jo getting her book would make the audience feel like you usually feel when the heroine is chosen by the hero. I wanted to seeI could create that feeling, but with a girl and her book.\"It is a perfect ending to a feminist, questioning film. But, in real le, imagine we could move beyond an either or choice for women where a relationship is not a stymie to her creative output or stem from an oppressive institution.Couples are increasingly turning their backs on marriage. Co-habitation is the fastest growing type of relationship in the UK where the number of co-habiting couples has doubled to . million in  years.The risks for women, though, are even greater in an unmarried partnership. There is a general misconception that co-habiting couples have legal rights similar to those of married couples, leaving women and their children vulnerable.In England last week the first mixed-sex civil partnerships took place after a law change brought about following a y campaign by a couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wanted a system that gives them legal protections without the patriarchal baggage of marriage.This is common in other parts of the world - from de-facto rights in Australia to Frances civil solidarity pact and mixed-sex civil partnerships in Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.Here, the Civil PartnershipBill is making its way through parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal in Scotland. Around , mixed-sex couples are expected to form civil partnerships next year.For feminists, for the non-religious, for those who want a new structure within which to define their relationships, this is an exciting development and it will be interesting to see how a civil pact, rather than a marriage, changes the way women feel and thrive in their relationships.The ambition of civil partnerships is to create true equality. If the much-adapted Little Women reflects how society feels about women at any given time, perhaps the next iteration will see Jo end up with both her novel and an equal match."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-murray-launches-labour-deputy-leader-bid","story":"Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South, won his seat with a majority of more than , and was the only Labour MP to win a seat.In his piece he wrote:ldquoI never again want to feel like I did at pm on the night of the general election.The former shadow Scottish secretary becomes the sixth candidate to declare in the contest and will stand againstshadow sport minister Rosena Allin-Khan, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities secretary Dawn Butler and shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood.In an exclusive article written forThe Mirror,the former shadow Scottish secretary said: ldquoIrsquom standing to be deputy leader of the Labour Party because I want to help us win power to transform lives.:Ian Murray lsquoexploring the possibilitiesrsquo of running for deputy Labour leaderldquoGrowing up on the Wester Hailes council estate in Edinburgh, the Tory Government believed families like ours didnrsquot deserve support.

was to publicly thank the Commonwealth country for hosting them during an extended private break over the festive period.The couple were described by a royal aide as feeling ldquoenergised and excited to be back in the UK, after spending the majority of a six-week break in the province of British Columbia, where they were spotted hiking on Vancouver Island. -- --The couple visited Canadarsquos High

chat with Ms Charette: ldquoTherersquos a hell of a lot of work to be done and things to be talked through but a very useful conversation.The High Commissioner said during the conversation the couple talked about their holiday and ldquosome of the things on their minds in terms of priorities for the next year and areas where they see maybe a shared priority with Canada. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Harry and

it.ldquoBut the warmth and hospitality we were shown while there was unbelievable, and thatrsquos exactly why we chose to go out there. -- --Meghan, a former actress, lived and worked in Toronto during her time starring in the popular US drama Suits, and the couple were famously pictured together when Meghan joined her then-boyfriend Harry at the  Invictus Games in the city.The duchess was beside her husband and told the High Commission staff: ldquoI want to say happy new year and thank you, and as my husband said, my goodness it was just such an incredible time we were able to have there, and with our son too.ldquoAnd just to be able to take in the warmth that we experienced from the people, but also just to walk around and just see the beauty of Canada.ldquoTo see Archie go

idea to a group of women who came together to cook at a Muslim cultural centre in North Kensington in the aftermath of the Grenfell blaze.Meghan travelled to see the women in North Kensington to hear the latest updates about their project and was joined by Harry. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex talk with the High Commissioner for Canada in the UK Janice Charette--After more than

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community. The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast family pays tribute to beautiful baby sophie hamilton","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

A couple of weeks after my daddy was buried someone threatened to kill my brother and that is when the threats started, and to be honest it hasn’t stopped.“It is really stressing my mum out . She is trying to deal with the fact that her le partner has gone. She is getting upset for us because she can’t understand how anyone can disrespect kids that have been through what we have been through.“They are just motivating us and the family are more defiant than ever to keep going.”Ian was stabbed to death at the front door of his house in Cluan Place as he prayed with local pastor Kevin Sambrook.

The reality is on December  the British public voted in overwhelming numbers to get Brexit by done by January  and to conclude the implementation period by December  so we can look forward to a bright future as an independent nation.“Page  of our manesto explicitly states that we will negotiate a trade agreement by next year, one that will strengthen our union and we will not extend the implementation period beyond December .“We are delivering on these promises that the British people have entrusted us to deliver and the Opposition is only interested in further delay and disruption.”Labour MP Chris Bryantearlier said he has “an anxiety” that a security deal will not be achieved by December , but Mr Barclay replied that after the election result “now, with absolute clarity on the timetable, we are working to, the UK and the EU will be able to get on with it”.Shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said Labour would not move its amendment designed to avoid a no-deal scenario by extending the transition, but also claimed the Tories lacked majority support for its plans.He said: “I think members opposite also ought to recognise that although under our electoral system the arithmetic in this place is very clear, the majority of the British people voted for parties that weren’t of the mind of the Conservative manesto and who wanted to give the British public a further say.“And I say that only not to deny the reality of the voting in this place, but that the members opposite ought to have some caution about the way that they approach this issue and claim authority from the British people.”Mr Blomfield said Labour “intended to provide an opportunity for the Government to come back to this House with their proposals, perhaps at report stage, on how we avoid the catastrophe of no-deal at the end of this year.”Liberal Democrat former minister Alistair Carmichael warned Mr Barclay that his words “will come back to haunt him”the UK does not conclude a deal by December .But Conservative former minister Sir John Redwood hit out at those criticising the timetable and also told the debate: “I don’t think we have to pay for a free trade agreement, I think it’s massively in the interests of the rest of the European Union – because they sell us more than we sell them. “But we have to be firm otherwise they’ll walk all over us again and demand more concessions.”The Government wants the Bill to complete its remaining stages in the Commons by the end of business on Thursday.It would then go to the Lords next week, with ministers confident it can conclude its passage through Parliament in time for it to be ratied by the European Parliament by the end of the month.That would mean the UK leaving the EU on January , with a deal in place covering citizens’ rights, the Irish border and Britain’s “orce bill” of about £ billion.Senior EU figures, including chief negotiator Michel Barnier, have warned that completing a trade deal in such a tight time-frame is likely to prove impossible."},{"url":null,"title":"heroic boys receive commendations after rescuing woman and baby from canal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His supporters in parliament erupted into a standing ovation when the result of the vote was announced in the Chamber of Deputies.The hairline margin of victory has raised doubts about how long the coalition government will last, as its policies require regular parliamentary approval. A government term is normally four years.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pedro Sanchez applauds with members of the Socialist party Coalition governments are common in Europe, but it is Spain’s first since the country ed to democracy in , three years after the death of long-time dictator General Francisco Franco.“A progressive coalition is going to govern because that is what Spaniards decided,” Mr Sanchez told the house before the vote.The -year-old has been caretaker prime minister since early last year.He is expected to be sworn in Wednesday and to hold his first cabinet meeting of ministers on Friday.His Socialists won two consecutive general elections in , but both times they failed to capture a parliamentary majority. That meant they could not win the parliamentary confidence vote required before taking office.In weeks of negotiations since the last election in November, Mr Sanchez mustered enough support — or promises to abstain — from a handful of small regional parties to take power.But he has been widely criticised for the deal he clinched with the regional Catalan ERC party for it to abstain in Tuesday’s vote. ERC, which holds  seats, is one of several groups that want Catalonia’s independence from Spain.Opposition parties, most of them right-wing, have lambasted Mr Sanchez for striking deals with parties intent on breaking up Spain, though he has insisted he will not allow the wealthy region’s secession.Pablo Casado, leader of the main opposition centre-right Popular Party, described Mr Sanchez as an “extremist” for putting the government in the hands of “terrorists and coup supporters” in references to the deals made with Basque and Catalan separatist parties to abstain in Tuesday’s vote.The Catalan independence push has brought Spain’s most serious political crisis in decades.The Socialists defend the deal with ERC, saying the Catalan crisis must be resolved through talks, something they have agreed to do with the ERC.Mr Sanchez tried to get elected in a first parliamentary confidence vote last Sunday, but he fell far short of the target of  votes. Under Spanish law, in the second round of voting on Tuesday he needed only a simple majority — more votes for him than against him.King Felipe VI asked him to try to form a government following the November  ballot, when the Socialists got the most votes but only  seats in the -seat Chamber of Deputies, Spain’s parliament.Mr Sanchez and United We Can leader Pablo Iglesias say they want to raise minimum salaries, income tax for high earners and capital gains tax. They also vow to defend women’s and immigrants’ rights."},{"url":null,"title":"506459","story":"US socialist and New York based trade union organiser Sherry Wolf will be in Derry on Wednesday to speak about efforts to challenge the policies of US President Donald Trump and the growing socialist movement in the US.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In winter, woods take on a whole new character - spectacular, frosty landscapes. Perfect for enjoying nature’s sights and sounds while burning off some of those extra calories! Crunch through frosty leaves, discover ancient hidden history or spot some elusive wildle – a woodland walk could spring up surprises you’ll never forget. Of course a visit is free and you’ll feel great after too. Here are some great woods across across Derry to visit during the festive season: Drumnaph Wood, Maghera googletag.cmd.push Drumnaph occupies a ridge above the meandering Grillagh River, which allows you to enjoy the views west to Carntogher Mountain and the beautul Sperrin Mountains.With over , trees planted in recent years, you’d be forgiven for thinking this was relatively young woodland, but actually, around % of the site is ancient woodland, making it a rare remnant of the great forest that once covered much of mid-Ulster.Winter provides a good chance to spot Irish hare as they are often seen around the edges of the woodland and in the surrounding fields in the colder months of the year. Prehen Wood googletag.cmd.push This rare and irreplaceable ancient woodland has a magical feel, with carpets of bluebell, celandine and wood anemone in the spring. It is home to the red squirrel, sparrowhawk and long-eared owl and offers terric views overlooking Derry city, as well as the River Foyle.Look out for the wooden sculptures created by Michael Rodgers that watch over the woods. There’s a squirrel, fox, hedgehog and butterfly to spot as you wander through the woodland.

Mary’s legacy will live on through all those who knew and loved her,” added the school principal.Former principal of St. Mary’s and long term colleague Tom O’Kane who worked with Mrs. Jamison for  years, also paid tribute“Mary was the le and soul of the school. She lit up every room she entered,” said the former principal.“She always found practical solutions to seemingly intractable problems, even imposed curriculum changes were soon worked through with Mary at the helm,” he said.“Mary was an inspiration to many pupils who followed her into the teaching profession. She was gentle but always told it as it was. Mary was a brilliant teacher and more importantly, a good friend to me,” added Tom. Mary’s Requiem Mass took place yesterday , at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Trench Road, with internment afterwards at St. Mary’s Cemetry, Ardmore.Mary is survived by her son Christopher, daughters Deirdre, Claire, Cathy and Anna, grandchildren Amy, Caoimhe, Erin, Holly, Noah and Jamie and brothers Seamus, Francis, Eugene, and was predeceased by her brother Damian. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The ‘Stute players were enraged that an apparent e by a Dungannon player in the build-up went unpunished but referee Steven Gregg played on, and Chris Lowe was able to cross into the six-yard box where Rhys Campbell, who only started due to an injury to Oisin Smyth in the warm up, tapped in from close range.The ill feeling from the last meeting between these two teams, which saw several red cards after the final whistle, was still evident, and after Niall Grace was cautioned for a challenge on Seanan Clucas, the Swts captain theatrically went down just outside the ‘Stute penalty area, and was surprisingly awarded a free kick. Douglas Wilson took the kick left-footed and almost found the bottom corner, only for Wells to push it behind for a corner.There was still absolutely no threat from ‘Stute to talk of and it would have been -not for an unbelievable save from Wells on  minutes. Goal scorer Campbell could not be stopped as he ran theof the pitch down the left wing, all the way into the ‘Stute penalty area, where he put the ball at the foot of Caolan McAleer who must have thought a goal was his until Wells somehow sprang across his goal to keep the ball out. It was a vital save from the ‘Stute goalkeeper.‘Stute somehow hung on and just before the half time break they got the goal they desperately needed. Oran Brogan won a free kick wide on the right just inside the Swts half, and Cormac Burke’s curling delivery into the heart of the penalty area eluded everyone, except Gareth Brown who headed home from close range following hesitation by goalkeeper Conor Byrne. It was just what Connor and his players needed after a one-sided and tension-filled first half. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -‘Stute were a dferent team entirely at the start of the second half, playing with an enthusiasm and a determination that was completely absent in the first period. Joe McCready for one was getting himself into the game as ‘Stute looked dangerous and were the better team for the first time in the game.That said, it still took until the hour mark before they tested Byrne again, and the Swts goalkeeper was very nearly caught by surprise, as Alex Pomeroy tried his luck from  yards, a half volley on the turn by Pomeroy flying towards the bottom corner until the goalkeeper touched it behind for a corner. From that corner, ‘Stute were nearly caught out themselves as Swts broke three on one, but Ryan Strain hesitated just a fraction too long, allowing numbers to get back, and when he did get the cross in, McAleer shot into the side netting and ‘Stute survived.The game was now end to end and McCready was left berating himself after he latched onto a superb ball through the heart of midfield by Graham Crown, but with a clear run on goal his touch deserted him and Byrne was able to come off his line to claim the ball.This was now a very competitive cup tie which both teams believed they could win, but disaster struck ‘Stute and in particular Graham Crown on  minutes. Under pressure from two Swts players, Crown attempted to head the ball back to his goalkeeper, but his attempt fell too short and Ben Gallagher, just on as a substitute simply lted it over the head of the stranded Wells into the net to make it -.It was hard to take for the home side, especially given their second half display, but they came again and nearly equalised within minutes, the impressive McCready picking out a cross for Pomeroy, but the youngster could not get enough on his header and glanced it well off target.To their immense credit, ‘Stute kept coming and they brought it level again after Burke worked his way into the penalty area, held off two challenges and curled the ball brilliantly beyond Byrne and into the top corner to make it - much to the delight of his manager and team mates.The game was headed to extra time but ‘Stute were left devastated as Michael Carvill got away with  minutes on the clock and kept his head to curl the ball beyond Wells and into the net to win the game for Swts in the most dramatic of fashions. Connor kept his players in the changing rooms for half an hour after the game, such was his annoyance with his teams exit from the cup.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all. Rumour has it that lsquoThe Prophetrsquo was observed entering the park this morning with a bill hook and a bow saw ndash preparations must be underway for ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Boyle.jpg","title":"Boyle family celebrates as Tom marks milestone 100th birthday  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man celebrated his th birthday before Christmas.Tom Boyle, the townrsquos former postmaster, became a centenarian on December .He was congratulated by a steady stream of relatives and well-wishers who called to the home he shares with we Maria in a low-key celebration.He is third local man to celebrate his centenary during .Felix Burns, from Rossglass, turned the big  in May, and was followed in August by Roddy Maguire from Downpatrick.All three received congratulatory card from the Queen.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable.

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

She said she was ready to sign up to a deal,it was “fair and balanced”.try catch  TrendingNI snow alert - first snow of  to arrive earlier than originally thoughtYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
