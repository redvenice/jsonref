However, the MHRA has expressed serious concerns about using the tests in this way and told the government on Tuesday it had not authorised them for this key purpose.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) claimed on Friday that the primary purpose of using rapid testing in schools was to find positive cases and that this did not require the MHRA’s approval, but that it was providing regulatory oversight.Ministers have repeatedly said the use of daily Covid-19 tests is critical to keeping children in education because it means those who test negative can remain in classrooms, instead of whole year groups having to self-isolate. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said last month: “Testing on this scale brings real benefits to education, it means more children, teachers and staff can stay in their classes in schools and colleges without the need to self-isolate.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “School leaders and staff are utterly tired of this endless confusion over lateral flow tests, alongside much else that has been landed on their plates during this crisis.“All they want is clarity about what is the right thing to do, and the reassurance that there is a sound scientific basis for what is proposed. What is obvious is that there are severe misgivings in many quarters about the use of lateral flow tests as an alternative to self-isolation for close contacts of positive cases. We call on the government to provide a clear and unequivocal statement on this matter.”The MHRA said on Friday that anyone who had been in close contact with a positive case who tests negative with a self-administered test should still self-isolate – undermining the core strategy to keep children in schools – but later said this did not apply to schools. The regulator said it was not required to authorise the daily tests used in schools because they were supervised by a trained person, usually a teacher.There was confusion and anger among headteachers, including those in secondary schools where daily testing was introduced last week.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said the government had “serious questions to answer” about its schools testing policy.“The suggestion that the MHRA have not approved these tests to be used as an alternative to self-isolation is alarming, as that is precisely what the government are suggesting schools should do as part of their testing strategy. The government also needs to urgently explain why it took such an approach if the MHRA approval was not in place,” he said.The use of the lateral flow tests, which take up to 30 minutes to produce a result, has ided experts. Some say they should be welcomed because they can quickly and cheaply identify infected people that would otherwise not have been identified. But others point to their low accuracy and say they risk doing more harm than good, especially when used in the way proposed by government, which is centred on keeping children in schools.The Labour MP Maria Eagle said she had written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to explain the “safety and lawfulness” of the daily testing policy, amid concerns about a sharp rise in cases at a Jaguar Land Rover site in Merseyside that has been carrying out rapid testing of workers.Prof Jon Deeks, a biostatistician of the University of Birmingham, said: “It’s clear that the regulator has agreed this is not a safe way of using these tests. We urgently need clarity from the government about what their mass-testing plans are for the future. It’s important for schools, teachers and children to know what the position is.”The government has spent at least £1.5bn on the lateral flow devices and they have been used by universities, care homes and hospitals. Ministers announced this week they would be distributed to all 317 local authorities in England.A senior MHRA official confirmed its position in an email seen by the  on Friday. The official wrote on 29 December that its approval “ONLY allows for the test to be used to ‘find’ positive cases. MHRA HAVE NOT approved the test for use in a ‘test to enable’ scenario” – such as allowing those who test negative to remain in school or the workplace.The email added: “Any other use of the kit is outside of MHRA’s remit and at the manufacturer’s own risk. We are therefore unable to comment any further on this matter.”DHSC has been contacted for comment. In a statement on Thursday night, it said: “Lateral flow devices are a vital tool to finding more asymptomatic cases and the government’s approach to testing in schools will reduce transmission. We are testing teachers and students weekly on site to find positive cases and break the chains of transmission. In addition, as part of an ongoing evaluation, we are doing daily contact testing in schools using an assisted testing model.“The evidence and lessons from these and other evaluations will be used to inform our review of the effect of daily contact testing on breaking chains of transmission and any future plans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ae55e2a48b4161e9d3759076f3bfdc087df702/1_194_2912_1748/master/2912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=468b998898cafa76401415addb79b0cc","title":"david bowies golden years in pictures","story":"The new biopic Stardust takes a wry look at the star’s first attempt to break America in 1971.

This usually elicits a mix of everything from, “Will there be another series of The Reluctant Landlord?” to, “How does somebody as desperately untalented as you make a living from comedy? (Please die.)” I was puzzled by the latter type of question as the only people seeing my Stories are those who follow me, which suggests that some people do so purely on the off-chance that I will invite questions so they can then strike.The other day, I started replying to the abusive ones with similarly abusive responses, which hasn’t helped. Rather, I seem to have made it clear that the best way to get a response is by sending me something horrible. Now, whenever I start a Q\u0026ampA, I open myself up to horrific trolling. I completely and utterly deserve this.The last time I did a Q\u0026ampA, somebody asked: “Have you made enough money to move out of Crawley and live in Horsham?” (Horsham is Crawley’s neighbouring town and they really look down on us, which is completely invalid now that we’ve got a Wagamama and a Five Guys.) In what I would describe as one of my less witty responses, I simply replied, “Fuck Horsham.” Job done.The next day, I was sent a link to an article in the local newspaper detailing the incident under the headline: “Comedian stokes fiery rivalry between towns”. Before you accuse me of bragging, elsewhere in the local paper was a story about a man who was annoyed about a lot of rubbish he’d found in a subway.The link was shared on the paper’s Facebook page and I made the mistake of looking at the comments underneath. Among the usual mix of “How is this news?”, “I don’t like Horsham either” and, “Why can’t this overexposed twat go and kill himself?” was a comment that really got to me. I can accept people not liking me, or not finding me funny, but this was different. A parent had posted: “Love the way he seems all jokey and a laugh, but is absolutely miserable and rude on the school run.” I couldn’t believe it somebody had formed an opinion of me based on my conduct on the bloody school run (when there was such a thing as a school run)! This felt unfair. Everyone is miserable on the school run, aren’t they? In fact, a stranger had made that exact point to the parent, and her response was that people say hello to me and I ignore them – but that my wife is nice.I don’t expect you to believe me, because this is exactly what I would say, but there is absolutely no way I would have the courage to walk around a school ignoring anyone who said hello to me. In fact, I am so paranoid about looking antisocial in front of my kids, in case they model my behaviour, that I look around for people to say hello to.I have to admit that the fact this commenter differentiated my behaviour from that of my wife was infuriating. It meant that I couldn’t expect any sympathy from her because a) she would find it hilarious and b) she would be delighted she was so highly thought of.Nevertheless, I risked it. I told her the whole story, and she listened intently, resisting the urge to smile when she was mentioned. She was incredulous. “Who the hell thinks you seem jokey and a laugh?” I had not anticipated her finding an option “c”.

On the current trajectory, the number of people being treated for Covid in England’s hospitals could be double that of the April 2020 peak within weeks.With the number of new Covid cases increasing by 55,761 on Friday, and a further 1,280 people reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive, sources made clear the government would await evidence on whether the Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission before considering laying out a timetable for lifting lockdown restrictions.However, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, appearing alongside Johnson, said there was early evidence that the measures put in place in London and the south-east had begun to bear fruit in controlling the virus.“The peak of the infections, we hope, already has happened in some parts of the country particularly in the south-east, east of England and London, where there was initially a really big surge with the new variant, and it is fantastic that that is beginning to happen thanks to what everyone has done,” he said. “Other areas that went into lockdown a bit later, that peak will be a bit later.”The new travel restrictions, which will come into force at 4am on Monday, will mean the suspension of all the remaining travel corridors, which had allowed arrivals from certain destinations to avoid quarantine.A new pre-flight testing regime was already due to come into place on Monday morning. It had originally been meant to start on Friday, but was delayed by the government at the last minute after the Department for Transport failed to produce the relevant guidance in time for passengers and airlines to be ready.The government had also already announced that it would halt arrivals from South America and Portugal in an effort to prevent a Brazilian variant of the virus reaching the UK.The additional measures, which also include increasing spot checks on members of the public who should be in quarantine, make it the toughest border policy the government has adopted at any time during the pandemic.Quarantine will last for 10 days, the prime minister said, unless arrivals pay to have a Covid test after five days and receive a negative result. The measures will remain in place at least until 15 February.Johnson faced a grilling this week from the senior Labour backbencher Yvette Cooper, who had urged him to take precautionary measures to prevent new variants of the virus arriving in the UK.Cooper chairs the home affairs select committee, which has repeatedly highlighted shortcomings in the enforcement of travel restrictions since the onset of the pandemic.It is unclear as yet whether the Brazilian variant of the disease that is causing concern, or other new and emerging variants, could be vaccine resistant.Business groups were taken by surprise by the new border measures. Joss Croft, the chief executive of UKinbound, the trade body for the overseas tourism industry, said his members would need financial help from the government.“Consumer safety is paramount and although the removal of all travel corridors is regrettable, given the current trajectory of the virus it’s an understandable decision. With our borders effectively closed, the government needs to provide urgent, tailored support for the inbound tourism industry,” he said.The shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said: “Unfortunately this announcement was inevitable.

It’s not a deployment to arrest him. Its a deployment to keep his security like any other presidential candidate has. It’s a simple as that.”Wine, who has galvanised a mass movement of young people challenging the president’s 34-year rule, said at a press conference on Friday morning that Ugandans should reject the results. “I am very confident that we defeated the dictator by far,” he said. “The people of Uganda voted massively for change of leadership from a dictatorship to a democratic government. But Mr Museveni is trying to paint a picture that he is in the lead.”Helicopters and tanks were on patrol as millions went to the polls on Thursday following one of the most turbulent and violent election campaigns. Wine’s rejection of the results could prolong heightened tensions in the east African country.Security forces loyal to Museveni violently suppressed opposition supporters during the campaign. Museveni’s bid for a sixth term in power was only made possible when MPs changed the constitution to remove age limits. He has repeatedly accused Wine of being a foreign-backed “traitor”, while Wine has branded him a “dictator”.Many in Africa see the challenge to Museveni, who at 76 is twice as old as Wine, as emblematic of a continent-wide generational struggle between ageing leaders who refuse to relinquish power and younger voters mobilising against them.The charismatic Wine has the backing of many young people in Uganda – where the median age is 15.7 – who are drawn to his anti-establishment message.Many observers have expressed fears of state-backed moves to prevent transparency during the polls. On Wednesday night internet access was cut off for most users in the east African country, though some have used VPNs to communicate online. Uganda’s electoral commission said the lack of internet access had not affected the tallying of the count from around the country.After polls closed on Thursday, hundreds of Wine supporters in Kampala returned to their polling stations to heed his call to “protect the vote” by watching the count. At the station where Wine had voted, security forces chased his supporters away.Isabella Akiteng, a civil society activist, said late on Thursday that she and 29 others who were observing the polls had been arrested at a hotel in Kampala and were being interrogated by police.On Wednesday, the US and EU said they would not observe the elections, after several officials were denied accreditation.Peter Mwesigye, director of the Africa Media Centre of Excellence, said it would take time to determine the extent of voter fraud and violence at the polls.“We know definitely there have been credible reports of fraud, but it’s going to be much harder and it will take many more days for us to begin to get the sense and scope of it,” he said. “The shutdown of the internet robbed the process of transparency that is required of an election. It has basically been an environment that doesn’t qualify for one to call it a free and fair election.”“We are calling upon our supporters to be calm. They want us to provoke and make us violent. We are non-violent people. We will definitely use all non-violent means possible that is going to be discussed by our legal teams.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dada28673a37f89c61e27dadd51281558c91b13e/0_281_4950_2971/master/4950.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=03cdb1a25917db8f8000404f1f0ec177","title":"uk nowhere near lifting covid lockdown restrictions vaccine research results","story":"Ministers waiting for results of vaccine research before laying out timetable, sources sayMinisters are awaiting evidence on whether the Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission of the virus before they can even consider laying out a timetable for lifting lockdown restrictions, government sources say.With early data suggesting the tide may be beginning to turn in some parts of the country, Boris Johnson has come under pressure from lockdown sceptics on his own backbenches to say how and when the “stay at home” order can be loosened.But a Downing Street source insisted: “It’s just too soon. We’re nowhere near even looking at what the process would be.” Johnson issued a video message on Friday, urging the public to “think twice before leaving the house this weekend”.As well as analysing the latest data on case numbers and hospitalisations, it is understood ministers are waiting to see Public Health England (PHE) research on the impact the vaccines may have on limiting the spread of the disease. “That’s very important,” one government insider said.Clinical trials demonstrated the overwhelming efficacy of the vaccines in preventing patients from becoming ill and dying with Covid but did not make clear whether those people could still be vectors for the virus.Johnson has been notably cautious about promising an end to the lockdown, warning that he cannot yet say whether schools will be able to reopen after the February half-term.He is unlikely to follow Scotland and Wales in tightening restrictions, focusing instead on compliance. The new business secretary, Kwazi Kwarteng, urged employers earlier this week to take “every possible step” to enable their staff to work from home.Data published by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Friday offered some early signs that infections appear to be levelling off.The number of people testing positive for the virus showed an increase on Friday, however, to 55,761, up from 48,682 on Thursday.While overall the R number suggests the outbreak is continuing to grow, there are regional differences, with London, the south-east and the east of England showing signs that infections could be levelling off or even potentially falling.“These estimates represent the transmission of Covid-19 over the past few weeks due to the time delay between someone being infected, having symptoms and needing healthcare,” the team behind the government’s R number data said.The Sage estimate is based on R values calculated from a number of teams, including the MRC Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University, whose own analysis is more upbeat – potentially because its number is calculated from different types of data to some other groups, including from mobility trends.Lockdown-sceptic Tory backbenchers have seized on early signs that the second wave may have peaked to press the case for the government to loosen restrictions.The Covid recovery group chair, Mark Harper, has set 8 March as a deadline for starting to reopen some aspects of the economy – three weeks on from the government’s 15 February deadline for vaccinating the most vulnerable groups.The Conservative MP Steve Baker wrote to colleagues earlier this week to say Johnson’s leadership would “inevitably be on the table” if he failed to set out “a clear plan for when our full freedoms will be restored” – though when the letter leaked to the Sun he quickly tweeted his support for the prime minister.Only 14 Conservative MPs voted against the latest lockdown rules, which expire at the end of March – but many others supported the government while calling for restrictions to be eased as soon as is practicable.However, ministers are focused on the fact that cases remain at an extremely high level, and the lag between infection and hospitalisation means the situation in hospitals will get worse before it gets better.Experts say it is too soon to asses whether cases have peaked. Dr Michael Tildesley, of the University of Warwick, who is part of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) that feeds into Sage, said more time was needed before it became clear how case numbers were changing.“There are early signals in the south-east and London that spread may be slowing, but there is still a lot of uncertainty around this,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45595ade1a1ac8f95b92f6dcd9081e4fe338d8fb/352_0_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b242c4374fd5487e02ea4c52e80033ef","title":"uk plans early g7 virtual meeting and presses ahead with switch to d10","story":"South Korea, India and Australia to be invited to join face-to-face summit in JuneBoris Johnson is planning to host a virtual G7 summit of world leaders within weeks of Joe Biden becoming US president in an attempt to set an ambitious agenda covering climate change, a worldwide vaccination programme, future pandemic preparedness and relations with China.He is also pressing ahead with plans to convert the face-to-face annual summit of the G7 in June into a D10 of leading democracies. It is due to be the first in-person meeting of world leaders for nearly two years, after the US-hosted G7 was cancelled and the Saudi-hosted G20 meeting moved online last year.The proposal to expand the G7 into a wider group has met resistance from some European states concerned it will be perceived as an anti-China alliance and a means of diluting the power of EU countries. Concern has been expressed within French and Italian diplomatic circles.An early virtual meeting of the G7 would provide Biden with a platform to show renewed US commitment to multilateralism.Johnson secured agreement to turn the UK-hosted G7 summit in June into a D10, an idea that has been circulating in US thinktanks for nearly a decade. As a result, South Korea, India and Australia are to be invited to all sessions of the event, which is due to be attended as usual by the US, Italy, France, Japan, Germany, Canada and the UK.Johnson’s expansion of the G7 is partly motivated by a wish to dovetail with Biden’s interest in promoting democracy as superior to authoritarianism. Biden has long proposed a summit for democracy in the first year of his presidency, and the D10 summit could provide a platform or a way station for a larger event. The prime minister is also keen to see the D10 combine to form a technological rival to China, and more broadly sees the G7 as a golden opportunity to show UK global leadership post-Brexit.Johnson, perceived by some Biden staffers as a Trumpian populist who has damaged multilateralism, knows he has work to rehabilitate himself with the new US administration, although the degree of tension has reduced due to the UK leaving the EU without a hard border on the island of Ireland.No country sought to block the British plan for the D10, partly as it is the host’s prerogative to organise the summit in the form they prefer. It is common, for instance, for other countries to be invited to some sessions.But diplomats from Italy, one of the countries with strong economic links with China, have expressed concern that this new format will be perceived as a building block of a new anti-Chinese alliance in the Indo-Pacific. Europe has shown notable determination to run its own China policy, last month agreeing an investment deal with China that angered the incoming Biden administration.Italy wants to ensure the G7 is not being transformed permanently, and French policy thinkers have questioned the D10 format. In a paper for the Institut Montaigne, Michel Duclos, a former ambassador, and Bruno Tertrais, a political scientist, wrote: “It goes without saying that Prime Minister Johnson will not fail to prepare an agenda for the G7 likely to please the Americans, thus including a ‘pro-democracy’ dimension. Let us not be surprised, moreover, if London tries to exploit the exercise for the benefit of ‘Global Britain’, by seeking in practice to downgrade the place of the European Union.”Johnson had been due to fly to India to discuss the format of the summit with Narendra Modi this month but has felt forced to postpone the visit owing to the scale of the coronavirus crisis. One of Johnson’s goals for the new group is to develop 5G technologies to prevent China dominating this critical element of 21st-century digital infrastructure, a goal already set by Biden advisers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395f6339b9c75dc6f69b3560bf9355a82e392c9d/156_26_3195_1917/master/3195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c267a68793188147000f093cb256573","title":"philippines taal volcano one year on in pictures","story":"When Taal volcano, a popular tourist site in Batangas, erupted a year ago 5,000 people fled the island.

Photograph: Jean-Francois MonierAFPGettyThe HSE is extending the interval between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from 21 to 28 days in a move that will spread the benefit of the vaccine to more people.In a letter on Thursday, HSE management was told that the interval was being extended to 28 days for “anyone who has their first dose of this vaccine from Monday, January 18th, 2021.”The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the only Covid-19 vaccine being administered in the State, is about 52 per cent effective after the first dose, according to data published by Pfizer last month.The extension of the dose interval will mean that there will be more vaccine first doses available to be given to frontline healthcare workers in hospitals and to residents and staff in nursing homes who are all being inoculated in the early stages of the vaccination programme.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Friday said the only constraint on the speed of rolling out the vaccine is supply.“There are unfortunately two things that are not under our control. The first is when the vaccine gets apprived by the EU. Secondly, it is the rate which manufacturers can supply it.“I heard news today that Pfizer might be closing down its speed and that is something that is not under our control.”The HSE said that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee updated their advice on the dose interval for the vaccine in guidelines published on Wednesday. The guidelines show that the vaccine course consists of two doses between 21 and 28 days apart.“If the interval between doses is longer than 28 days, the second dose should still be given as soon as possible. The course does not need to be restarted,” the guidelines state.All long-term care facilities will be sent new information leaflets to allow them to inform residents and staff of the change and aftercare leaflets are being updated with the changes.“It is vitally important that all stocks of old information materials and aftercare leaflets are removed from circulation so that they cannot be used from 18th January,” says the HSE letter from senior manager David Walsh to management across the health service.“The vaccinator should confirm to the recipient at the time of vaccination that their second dose is due 28 days after the first dose. Schedules for second dose of vaccinations should be updated accordingly.”Nursing home management, staff and relatives of residents have been calling for an acceleration of the vaccination programme to 24 hours a day, seven days a week as the high level of virus in the community is leading to an increase in the number of outbreaks in care facilities.The HSE said this week there were 142 nursing home outbreaks and that it was monitoring 103 closely. Including all long-term care facilities, there are 279 open outbreaks.The number of new nursing home outbreaks more than doubled to 52 last week.Concerns have been expressed by nursing home managers and advocates for nursing home residents that the vaccine may not be administered in long-term care facilities that are battling outbreaks where there are 50 residents and more than 80 per cent have Covid.The vaccine cannot be given to anyone who has a Covid infection or who has had an infection, shown symptoms or tested positive in the previous four weeks.Protection from a first dose of the vaccine does not kick in until at least 12 days and the single does is significantly less protective than two. There is 95 per cent protection from two doses.The HSE said this week that more than 77,000 Covid-19 vaccines have been administered, including 69,378 vaccinations going to frontline healthcare staff.A further 47,600 vaccinations are planned for next week, of whom about 3,900 will be receiving their second vaccination under the previous 21-day interval.First doseAs of January 13th, 77,303 people had received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Government’s Covid-19 data hub website, which states the page will be “regularly updated”.It emerged on Thursday that vaccine roll-out in nursing homes is being recorded with pen and paper as the IT system to deal with the inoculation programme is not in place. Independent TD Cathal Berry, who is also a medical doctor, told the Dáil that “in effect, we are combining 21st century cutting-edge vaccine medicine with a 13th century means of recording it, which is simply a pencil and paper”. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar acknowledged that vaccinating in nursing homes and in healthcare settings was “a pen and paper exercise at the moment”. He said an information technology (IT) system had been delivered to the HSE at the end of December. “We will very much need the IT system when we go out to the GPs and pharmacies. I am told that we will be ready for when it is required, which is, most likely, next month sometime.”At a briefing on Thursday afternoon, HSE Chief Executive Paul Reid said 69,378 of the vaccines were received by frontline healthcare workers and 7,925 were received by people in long-term care facilities.The Government expects that at least four million people in the State will be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of September.Updated projections sent by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to TDs on Wednesday night say that while 700,000 people will be vaccinated by the end of March, the State now expects to receive some 3.7 million doses between April and the end of June and a further 3.8 million between July and the end of September. This would mean that at least 4 million people could be vaccinated by that time.It is expected, however, that most adults will be vaccinated by the end of the summer once additional vaccines are approved by the European Medicines Agency in the coming weeks.Ireland began vaccinating its population at the end of December using the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.On Tuesday afternoon, the first delivery of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine arrived in the country . Ireland has pre-ordered 875,000 doses of the vaccine.On Twitter Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the first delivery was a small one, but that “every vaccine counts”.The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine entered the final phase of the approval process during the week, according to the European Medicines Agency. A statement by the agency said an opinion on the marketing authorisation could be issued by January 29th.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4459637.1610738554!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland to remain exempt from tighter uk travel rules","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson announced he was scrapping the UK  ‘travel corridor’ system in light of increasing Covid-19 infection rates. Photo by Dominic Lipinski   AFP via Getty ImagesIreland is to remain exempt from stricter UK travel rules announced on Friday evening by prime minister Boris Johnson.Up to Friday, travellers to the UK from Ireland and certain other countries were exempt from automatic quarantine requirements under the “travel corridor” system.On Friday, Mr Johnson announced the system is being scrapped in light of increasing Covid-19 infection rates and a new variants of the virus being discovered in Brazil.The affected countries are mainly British colonies and countries with low infection rates such as New Zealand.From Monday anyone travelling to the UK from these countries will have to self-isolate for ten days. This can be shortened to five days if they receive a negative Covid-19 test on arrival.Ireland will remain exempt from these restrictions, meaning people can still travel to Northern Ireland and the mainland UK without having to quarantine.However Irish travellers must still abide by local restrictions at their destination.Certain professions, such as lorry drivers, are also exempt from the quarantine rules.“It’s precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country,” Mr Johnson said at a press conference on Friday.“Yesterday we announced that we’re banning flights from South America and Portugal and to protect us against the risk from as-yet-unidentified strains we will also temporarily close all travel corridors from 4am on Monday.“Following conversations with the devolved administrations we will act together so this applies across the whole of the UK.”Also from Monday, travellers arriving in the UK will have to produce a negative test before leaving their point of departure. This will also not apply to people travelling from Ireland.Those in breach of the new rule may be fined up to £500.A further 1,280 Covid-19 patients died in the UK over the previous 24 hours and 55,761 new cases were confirmed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4458651.1610649544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the social worker said were two seconds of pleasure worth it for all this","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStephanie Walsh was asked in 1971 if her family would offer a temporary home to a young pregnant girl. Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneLast week Stephanie Walsh wrote in The  about how she was asked in 1971 if her family would offer a temporary home to a young pregnant girl, as an alternative to the girl going to a mother and baby homes.“I had just given birth to our third child when the 17-year-old pregnant schoolgirl came to live with us, acting as an au pair. The girl and her parents wished for her pregnancy to be kept secret. This was the climate of the early 1970s.“This girl was part of our family until her baby was born,” she wrote. Later the young mother, following discussions with Walsh, her own parents and a social worker, decided to have the baby adopted.“At that time it seemed the best option for the baby and the mother. In the Ireland of the time, single pregnant girls had few choices.”She was not alone. Elaine O’Malley, then in her early 20s, and her husband, who live in Co Limerick, offered a home to five young women – some in their early 20s, one under 17 – between 1979 and 1983.Following an inspection by a social worker, “it went from there”, she says. No money was exchanged. The girls stayed for up to six months, had their own room and helped out around the house and with babysitting.“They were very much part of the house. They ate with us, watched television with us, were part of the family. I smoked at the time, so we smoked together, and went on days out on Sundays, and on weekends away.”The O’Malleys never asked the women their stories, but the women shared over time. One, who had recently lost her father, did not want to hurt her bereaved mother by telling her she was pregnant. One told her family that she had got a job elsewhere.“The youngest was still at school. Another had a boyfriend who visited. “We knew these girls were going through hell,” she says. Once a girl ran away. When she came back, the social worker came to see her.O’Malley was in the room with the two of them for the meeting. “I can still remember what the social worker said to the girl. She said, ‘Was it really worth it? Was two seconds of pleasure worth it for all this?’ ”AdoptionThe O’Malleys drove the women to the maternity hospital, where their social worker met them. “I visited every day after that.” It was understood that the babies would be given up for adoption, but the women did have six months to change their minds.O’Malley was present for the handing over of one baby. “The girl and the baby and a nun went into a room, and then the girl came out without her baby.” O’Malley had lost a baby to infant mortality, so she understood profound grief.“The difference was, my baby died. I didn’t have to give him up,” she says. “I found watching that handover heartbreaking. Those girls were not giving up their babies by choice. There wasn’t another option open to them.”Afterwards, the girls stayed with the O’Malleys for a week or 10 days, to try and adjust. “We wanted them to stay longer, but after a week or so the social worker would come out and say, ‘It’s time to get back to your life now.’“We had been told from the beginning by the social worker that we’d never hear from these girls again once they left that we were part of a past they would want to forget,” she says. “We think of those girls who lived with us so often, especially this week.”The social workerBridget, who prefers not to be identified, was a social worker in the west of Ireland for 25 years from the late 1970s. She was one of two who worked full time with women facing crisis pregnancies: “My abiding memory of that work is grief,” she says.“That has stayed with me. I feel this inside in the marrow of my bones, because everyone I worked with had grief. People who couldn’t have a baby – I’m talking about adoptive applicants – they had terrible grief.“The women who placed babies for adoption I can’t even begin to describe the grief of that loss. And the adopted children not knowing who you are really is the biggest loss of all. Although who can say what is the biggest loss of all?“Mothers would have come to us in a state over their daughters being pregnant,” she says. “I don’t ever remember a father coming in: by that, I mean the father of the pregnant girl. I don’t ever remember a boyfriend of a girl coming.“It was always a woman, whether it was the girl by herself. Sometimes they didn’t tell their parents. Or sometimes it was a friend of the girl came with her a girlfriend. The men were absent.”Mostly they were in their 20s and 30s. Many of them worked full time and were terrified they would lose their jobs. No matter what age they were, she says, it was “very difficult for anyone to keep a baby unless they had support from home, and support from home wasn’t always there”.In all, her adoption agency dealt with 400 cases. Sometimes Bridget had to be the one to deliver the news of the pregnancy to a parent.“I remember one girl couldn’t face her mother. She just couldn’t tell her. So she asked me if I would tell her.“So I wrote to her mother and asked if she would meet me. And she did. I told her that her daughter was pregnant. And she said, ‘I would prefer if you had told me she had cancer.’ And those were the days when a cancer diagnosis more than likely meant death, in people’s heads.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4459619.1610738012!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"td calls for serious scrutiny of leave eu group that relocated to waterford","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin Rathdown TD Neale Richmond said the group required investigation even if it sought to move ‘just as a flag of convenience’. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe A Fine Gael TD has renewed his appeal to the Government to investigate with a “serious level of scrutiny” the Leave.EU organisation which has relocated its registered office from the UK to Waterford.The Brexit campaign group which backed former MEP Nigel Farage, re-registered in Ireland because it would lose its domain name if it remained at its Bristol address, following the UK’s departure from the EU.Dublin Rathdown TD Neale Richmond said it required investigation even if it sought to move “just as a flag of convenience” because of its “absolutely toxic brand of campaigns and politics” which went beyond Brexit and was directed at immigration, the media and iniduals including Ministers in the Irish Government.He appealed to Minister for Local Government Darragh O’Brien and the Coalition “to make sure that Leave.EU, quite simply, is not welcome in Ireland”.He said the group also “trades in senseless and baseless xenophobia the likes of which we in this country should not and do not have any time for”.It emerged last week that Leave.EU, co-founded and funded by British businessman Arron Banks who supported Mr Farage’s UKip party, re-registered in Ireland.It was one of 80,000 domain names registered to a UK address which have been suspended until the end of March.After that date they have to show proof of EU citizenship and that they are domiciled in one of the 27 EU member states.Data accessMr Richmond, Fine Gael’s Brexit spokesman, has written to authorities in Ireland and the EU including the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) the Revenue Commissioners and the Data Protection Commissioner about the group’s domain name registration and its accounts and status with Revenue.Mr Richmond said he was also concerned “crucially” about the organisation’s storage of data because it “has access to data of tens of thousands of iniduals in the United Kingdom and beyond”.Raising the issue in the Dáil the Government TD said the group had received numerous fines in the UK “for its campaigning activity, storage of data and funding”.He claimed it “has associations with quite dubious characters, inside and outside the organisation, which merit serious concern.“The group is connected, directly and indirectly, with some of the scary events that unfolded in Washington DC last week and this should not be dismissed out of hand.”He also claimed the organisation was “politically subversive” and “if allowed to gain a foothold in our democracy, would have a detrimental effect”.Speaking for Mr O’Brien Minister of State Anne Rabbitte said the Government is reviewing current electoral law “and the conduct of politics in Ireland to ensure donations and resources from non-citizens outside the State are not being utilised to influence our elections and political process”.The Government plans to establish an electoral commission, which the Minister said would contribute to such a review."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4459605.1610736811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s mounting brexit woes unlikely to convince eu to reopen deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFreight lorries queueing at the check-in area for the Port of Dover in Kent, where Channel traffic has begin to build up following a quiet start to the year. Photograph: Gareth FullerPA WireIrish companies hoping that difficulties in trade with Britain could be eased by tweaks to the rules from Brussels may be in for a disappointment.This week the Irish Freight Transport Association wrote to Taoiseach Micheál Martin to warn of disruption to supply chains, emptying supermarket shelves and jobs at risk unless the rules are at least temporarily relaxed.But the view of officials is that companies must adjust their supply chains to reflect the new reality, and insist the private sector has long been urged to do so and offered support.It’s expected that the effect of Britain’s departure will increasingly be apparent in the coming weeks as levels of trade ramp up following a seasonal slump.There is a profound lack of appetite in the European Union for the deal to be reopened or tweaked, particularly only a fortnight into its implementation as the pandemic continues to rage.The attitude from the EU is: Britain has received what it asked for.The trade friction now being seen, which all but rules out Britain’s future as a distribution hub for the Irish market, is the consequence of its policy position of leaving the single market and customs union, set down years ago by Theresa May as prime minister.Britain was offered a way to avoid onerous checks on animal and food products if it aligned with the EU. London declined, explaining that the point of Brexit was to erge.In other words, what is happening is a result of Britain’s choices. This includes the strict rules of origin that are impeding EU goods destined for Ireland if they come via a British distribution hub.Musical discordThe point was made by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, this week amid domestic uproar in Britain that touring musicians and entertainers would need visas to perform in EU member states, a bureaucratic headache that makes it difficult to go on tour.The British press reported that the government had turned down an EU offer to exempt performers from the requirements, drawing the ire of Radiohead’s Thom Yorke.“Wow,” he tweeted. “Spineless f***s.”Speaking to journalists, Barnier appeared to confirm the report.“A lot of the consequences of Brexit, which are numerous and serious, have been underestimated and often badly explained,” Barnier said.The British government has insisted it was Brussels that thwarted an accord. Yet throughout the talks, it was Brussels that sought a closer relationship, and London that insisted on the deepest break.There may be more cold showers to come. UK professional qualifications will no longer be recognised in the EU, something only possible now through case-by-case negotiations with member states – a big blow to some of the UK’s mighty service industries, such as in law or architecture, that many may not have woken up to yet.In the words of a Dutch customs official as he seized sandwiches from a British driver at the Hook of Holland ferry terminal this week: “Welcome to the Brexit, sir.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4459611.1610737675!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who has what it takes to become the next german chancellor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGermany’s conservative CDU party will pick a new leader  from three candidates: moderate Armin Laschet (pictured), arch-conservative Friedrich Merz and outsider Norbert Röttgen. Photograph: Odd AndersenAFP via Getty ImagesNone of the three men running to lead Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Saturday have what it takes to be chancellor, according to a public television survey.After two false starts, 1,001 delegates will on Saturday choose a new leader after the successor to chancellor Angela Merkel quit just over a year into the job.On Friday Germany’s ZDF public television asked which of the candidates ordinary people think has what it takes to be the next chancellor after September’s federal election. Both frontrunners finished neck-and-neck, but on just 28 per cent support.That is likely to increase the competition between the two men, Friedrich Merz, a conservative-liberal lawyer, and Armin Laschet, minister president of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.Outsider candidateAmong CDU voters polled, 37 per cent liked the idea of a Chancellor Merz, an outsider candidate and rival of Dr Merkel, while just 24 per cent were for Mr Laschet, who is seen as a continuity candidate. One in five voters had no opinion.“The party’s business and rural wings are for Merz, while Laschet has more of the urban vote,” said a senior party official. “The new leader is not chosen by party members but delegates, party officials at various levels, from federal down to local level, and they are more wary of Merz than the wider party membership.”Most observers expect a first round of voting to end inconclusively and eliminate a third candidate, CDU foreign policy spokesman Norbert Röttgen, with his transfers crucial for crowning a new leader.But Saturday’s vote will leave unanswered the most crucial question for Germany’s European neighbours: who will head the CDU’s race for the chancellery when Dr Merkel departs after four terms?First refusalNormally the CDU leader has first refusal on the position, but concerns over Mr Laschet’s personal popularity has prompted party officials to insist ahead that the chancellor candidate race remains open until at least Easter.Dr Merkel’s health minister Jens Spahn, struggling to conceal his ambition for the chancellery, hopes his decisive action in the Covid-19 pandemic will stand him in good stead. The ZDF poll suggests average voters are less impressed with his performance, however, with just one-third convinced he has what it takes to be the next German leader.The only centre-right candidate with majority support, 54 per cent, is not even in the CDU but its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).Its leader, Markus Söder, is hoping to be only the third Bavarian to run for the chancellery – and the first to succeed.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Trump\u0026#39s White House packs up as one of the least civil presidential handovers in history begins‘I need to protect myself in case there is a civil war’: Why middle-class America is arming up\u0026#39We are under siege\u0026#39: Bobi Wine says military raided home as he rejects \u0026#39rigged\u0026#39 Uganda election resultsGovernment must \u0026#39get a grip\u0026#39 of what is now a full-blown crisis in the fishing industry, say fishermenMerkel focuses on pandemic legacy as her party considers whether to break with herJury trials should be paused because of new Covid variant, solicitors urgeGoogle\u0026#39s Blob Opera project allows music lovers to hit high notesSpring \u0026#39going to be a lot better,\u0026#39 says Chris Whitty, but still no timeline for lockdown exitGreene King to rename pubs \u0026#39linked with racism\u0026#39Exclusive: Boris Johnson says he is \u0026#39taking a stand\u0026#39 against \u0026#39cruel\u0026#39 Japanese whale killing Opening of ski resorts in Italy postponed until mid-FebruaryViktor Orban offers young voters tax break in bid to boost popularity and stop brain drainSpanish kings\u0026#39s former lover says he was behind threats to kill her over hunting trip scandalHow 247 Covid-19 vaccinations could protect all adults by JuneAnxiety levels at highest since first lockdown, figures showBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine success brink oftransforming lockdown debate","story":"After almost a year of watching the seemingly unstoppable onslaught of Covid-19, the speed of progress now is hard to take in. Just a few months ago, Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, was telling colleagues he didn’t believe a vaccine would come in time. Now we have several of them, highly effective, already delivered to millions worldwide. The logistics, the safety: it’s all going as well as can be expected – in Britain, especially. The big question is what happens next.Israel will be the first to give the world an answer. Benjamin Netanyahu, up for re-election in March, is now campaigning as the vaccine king after cutting a deal with Pfizer to make his country the “model state” of the Covid inoculation. He’s offering up vast amounts of anonymised health data, to help Pfizer learn more, and supplies have come rolling in.Israel, a country the size of Wales, will soon be vaccinating as many people a day as Italy, France and Germany put together. Already three-quarters of its over-60s (ie, those most likely to die from the virus) have been protected. The rest will be covered within days, not weeks.Israel won’t see a collapsing R-number or plummeting infections: not for a while, at least. The main vaccine effect should be a breakdown in the link between infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Protecting a small number of people should mean big results, given that the oldest 20 per cent account for 90 per cent of virus fatalities. If all goes as planned, then Israel will have downgraded Covid from a fatal virus to a bug which is nasty, but no longer the killer we have come to know.The vaccine idend should be discernible in Israeli hospitals very soon. Scientists at the Weizmann Institute reckon that the proportion of over-60s in critical care will have roughly halved within two weeks. By Easter, it thinks, most Covid deaths will be eliminated in Israel. It will be the first major country in the world to achieve this.And, all going well, Britain should be the second. Our vaccination programme is still steaming ahead. The Prime Minister’s first deadline – 13 million vaccinations by the middle of next month – remains in sight. Just over half of Britain’s Covid-19 deaths are amongst the over-80s, almost all of whom should have been offered a vaccine within a fortnight. Add another two weeks for the vaccine’s protection to set in, and the number dying from Covid-19 should be half what it would otherwise have been by the end of next month.This is the projection by the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, which has had a strikingly good track record since it was set up to monitor the pandemic. If Nadhim Zahawi’s vaccination programme goes roughly to plan, it says, hospital admissions will be half what they’d otherwise be by mid-March. Intensive care admissions would be down by only a third: a lower number because those admitted tend to be younger. But overall, the Covid-19 burden on the health service will look very different very soon.While plenty can still go wrong, ministers remain pretty confident – and more than they let on. Some in government think the official target will be easily surpassed – although they’ve been told never to confess as much in public. Kate Bingham, who masterminded the vaccine procurement programme, almost let the cat out of the bag recently by saying the schedule will be “met – and possibly exceeded”.If she’s right, and if Covid deaths fall by 80 per cent by mid-March, can lockdown restrictions still be justified? Politically, it’s a difficult question and battle lines are already being sketched out. Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, has said that we won’t be able to go back to normal “while the virus will still be circulating” – which it’s likely to keep doing throughout the summer. Even with hospital numbers down, he says, Covid-19 can still be a debilitating disease with lasting side effectsAt this point, what would Matt Hancock say? Once everyone likely to die from the virus has been vaccinated, would he be prepared to lift restrictions and be accused of letting the virus rip amongst the young?  I asked him recently and he hinted that he was ready for the fight. “There are many illnesses in the world,” he said. “We have to live our lives.”These words sound odd, coming from a minister who usually argues for tighter lockdown. Only last weekend he was privately arguing it was time to stop people exercising (ie, walking) with a friend. But there’s not necessarily a contradiction. In Israel, it’s argued that tighter lockdowns mean earlier relaxation – because the virus, if it gets out control, slows vaccination. The country’s Covid tsar, Nachman Ash, has said he’s ready to unlock even if virus levels are still high. “Our strategy is to inoculate the people who are at the highest risk,” he said, “so we can open the economy even if the number of infected has still not gone down.”Sceptics grumble that Israel’s example may not be so instructive because it’s unique: a tiny, highly-organised country with the world’s best digitised health records. It doesn’t need to slow things down by asking vaccinated people to wait 15 minutes to see if they suffer an anaphylactic shock: they know who’s at risk because their technology tells them. But the basic theory Israel is testing is that Covid’s power to kill can be stopped quite quickly. That, if proven, will be a universal lesson.Many Tories are getting nervous and want the Prime Minister to commit to relaxing as soon as the top-risk group are vaccinated. But he has an obvious retort: that it’s still a theory. Even Israel is waiting to see what the hospital numbers show, whether the theory pans out. All depends on how the relationship between infection numbers, hospital numbers and deaths really does change. Britain will find out soon, but not for a few weeks.This week, Netanyahu told his Cabinet that it’s precisely because they’re so close to the finish line that they need to keep discipline now. “This is how we will save lives,” he said. “This is how we will be first in the world to emerge from the coronavirus.” It would be quite a boast for Boris Johnson if Britain were to be the second.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"occasion covid recovery group has over reached","story":"After the 2017 General Election I gave Theresa May what I thought was some helpful advice. Even with the small majority you are able to command you can still wield considerable power as Prime Minister and you should use it to convey your strength at every opportunity to have a chance of success, I said. She never took the advice, and the rest is history, it was the worst Government in living memory. Boris Johnson, with the same difficult numbers in the House of Commons, immediately saw the benefit of projecting strength and decisiveness by picking fights - sacking MPs and even trying to dissolve the Commons. He knew how to wield power, even when that power was limited, and it won him a big Parliamentary majority.  It is in this context the current power struggle with the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) needs to be seen. The Prime Minister won a big majority just over a year ago and those numbers will not change much in this Parliament. That means that the influence of the CRG will need to be carefully deployed if it really wants to make an impact. It clearly has some incredibly talented people involved: Mark Harper, Steve Baker and Graham Brady should all be in Government. It is odd, therefore, to see dark threats being made about the Prime Minister\u0027s leadership which can only be viewed as premature and cack-handed at this stage. Steve Baker, a generally astute and clever operator with a good mind, has over-reached on this occasion.That is not to say there is not considerable unease flowing through the Parliamentary Conservative Party, some of it borne out of resentment over job demotions - but by no means all of it. They are genuine concerns about the poor handling of the Covid crisis and the extent to which the economy is going to feel the long-term impact - concerns which are reflected by the public. New MPs with small majorities and southern, predominantly middle class seats are feeling the heat from businesses and angry constituents - and they know that the economy is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. How is the Government going to pay for, let alone deliver, its levelling up agenda to win those northern seats with the huge financial deficit and increased national debt burden? These are good reasons why the request to the Prime Minister to give clarity to a Covid exit route is reasonable and one which the Government should use sensibly to settle the nerves of its MPs and the country.But, it was still a mistake for the CRG to use these issues as a stick to beat with which to try and beat the Prime Minister out of office. Why? Because there are almost no circumstances where the Prime Minister will be booted out of office in the manner of his predecessor. Not least because the Labour Party is still not presenting a realistic alternative government or serious threat in the opinion polls, due to an opposition leader apparently devoid of leadership skills himself. As each day goes by, Keir Starmer looks increasingly like the lawyer he is, someone who cannot make a decision without being tangled in the small print. He appears to have no gut instinct for what the country is thinking or feeling. Without a serious opposition challenge, it is difficult to put a Prime Minister under sustained political pressure.   The Chief Whip will be feeding back the growing unease felt in the Parliamentary party, and whoever is advising Boris Johnson would be wise to tell him to project power and leadership by telling the country exactly how we are going to get out of the Covid mess. Things will get worse before they get better, and strong, decisive leadership will be required.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day foggy blackpool tower walking ice flying kite","story":"Health staff members walk through the corridors of the Getulio Vargas University Hospital.

Some 81 per cent of French in the same poll criticised the speed of the rollout.After a painfully slow start, 318,000 people had received jabs by Friday - mainly elderly retirement patients and staff and health workers over 50 or considered high-risk.The over 75s will follow starting next week, along with 800,000 other high-risk iniduals. Olivier Véran, the health minister, on Friday insisted France had enough doses to vaccinate 2.4 million people by then end of February.Gaël Slimane of Odoxa put the sudden jump in those in favour of a jab to the rise of “the politics of supply”.“Doubts were dispelled from the moment vaccination was concretely put in place in France and from the moment it had proved itself on millions of people around the world,” he said.“There was no need to wait for a majority of French to be for vaccination to put it in place, on the contrary.”The elderly are the most in favour, with men far more enthusiastic than women and city dwellers more in favour than country dwellers, the poll found.Politically, supporters of President Emmanuel Macron were the most pro-vaccine and those of far-Right leader Marine Le Pen the least. After initially expressing scepticism, Ms Le Pen changed her tune late last week to say she would be getting.However, scepticism remains high among many health and care workers with one government minister this week warning that only 20 per cent of retirement home staff were in favour. She called for a national awareness campaign.Françoise Salvadori, an immunology specialist whose 2019 book Antivax, co-written with Laurent-Henri Vignaud, a science historian, examines vaccine scepticism in the west since the 18th century, said it was still a little early to say whether the tide had turned in France.“We need to wait a bit and above all see what happens when retirement home residents have been widely vaccinated (old people are not the most anti-vaccine), she said.A close eye should be kept on “paramedics, nurses and auxiliary nurses who are in general rather sceptical even if they have a role to play in setting an example, like doctors, and we need them so much.In France, only a fifth of retirement home staff are willing to be vaccinated, a government minister revealed earlier this week.People in France are more sceptical of vaccines and the benefits of science than in any other country in the world, according to a major recent study on attitudes to science and health released in 2019.In a survey of 140 countries – the largest to date – the Wellcome Trust and Gallup found that a third of people France, home of immunologist Louis Pasteur, do not believe that vaccines are safe, while 55 per cent now see science and technology as a threat to their employment prospects rather than a wealth creator.Against this backdrop, French prime minister Jean Castex on Thursday insisted that mass vaccination was the best way to “hope for a progressive exit” from draconian restrictions “by next summer”.In a press conference, he announced a nationwide 6pm curfew starting on Saturday, tightening one already in place since December which restricts movement from 8pm to 6am.The earlier curfew notably aims tocounter the apéro effect”, according to Stanislas Guérini, a leading figure in President Emmanuel Macron\u0027s party. The fear is that people are flouting warnings to resist getting together for post-work, pre-dinner aperitifs.Mr Castex described the country\u0027s situation as worrying with infections remaining at a high plateau.He also announced new restrictions for people arriving into the country. People travelling from non-EU countries will no longer be allowed enter by presenting a negative result from a quick Covid-19 test, but cross-Channel truck drivers will be exempt, the French government said on Friday.The new rules, which come into force from Monday, January 18, say people will no longer be able to use antigen, or lateral flow, tests that can deliver results within minutes.Instead, they must take a PCR test within 72 hours of departure. These can take several days to produce the results, and are less widely available in Britain for people who do not have a medical justification for getting tested.Both PCR and antigen tests had been accepted until now.However, French transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said on Friday truck drivers would still, for the time being, be able to get into France by using one of the quicker tests while waiting for a coordinated plan between European countries.France has so far recorded more than 69,000 coronavirus deaths - the seventh-highest death toll in the world.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir ben ainslie buffeted sandbagging claims losing streak turns","story":"He may be regarded as Britain’s greatest sailor since Francis Drake, but Sir Ben Ainslie has hit a patch of rough weather. The four times Olympic champion has been accused of what – to the outsider at least – might appear to be underhand tactics.Sailing commentators have suggested that Ainslie has indulged in a bit of ‘sandbagging\u0027, namely the art of initially underperforming in order to fool your competitors in later events.The startling accusations came after Ainslie’s Ineos Team UK made a flying start in the Prada Cup Challenger Series in Auckland on Friday, a key qualifier which will determine who goes on to race defenders New Zealand for the prestigious 36th America’s Cup match, in March.But Ineos Team UK’s victories have led to claims that a run of humiliating losses last month suggested that Ainslie’s team had deliberately underperformed in previous races, in order to cleverly hoodwink their rivals about their potential strength.Ainslie laughed off the accusation – which came after what most aficionados regarded as a surprising turnaround for him and his crew – saying that the team’s success was down to his vessel, Britannia, undergoing a thorough overhaul over the Christmas and New Year holidays.This was in part thanks to input from engineers from the Mercedes Formula One team, with everything but the hull being modified to give Britannia the required edge.  Ineos had been humiliated in a pre-Christmas warm-up regatta when it lost six races in a row in the World Series event, leading Ainslie to describe the team as being at “rock bottom”.Britannia, its sleek all-black AC75 monohull foiler, was so sluggish through manoeuvres in that pre-Christmas regatta, and so vulnerable in the lighter airs (repeatedly falling off its foils in anything below 12 knots) that few gave Ineos any chance of being competitive so soon.However, Friday saw Ainslie’s team embark on a stunning reversal of fortune, winning its opening two races against American Magic and Luna Rossa to grab an early lead in the three-team round robin.While playing mind games with the opposition is common practice in many sports, including sailing, Ainslie’s unexpected success on Friday led to dark mutterings.Commentators on the America’s Cup television feed suggested that Ineos Team UK might have been purposely holding back its performance during last month\u0027s defeats in order to fool rivals.During the commentary Nathan Outteridge, the Australian who skippered Artemis in the 2017 America\u0027s Cup in Bermuda, said: “I’m sorry guys, but does anyone else think they’ve been sandbagging? It’s unbelievable what we’re seeing. We’ve been talking all summer, all Christmas, about what went wrong there. Asking how come they’re so far behind. And then they’re just coming out and just being dominant. Where did this come from?”Parallels were drawn with the British Cycling team and its road racing counterparts Team Sky, now Ineos Grenadiers, who gave the impression of reserving its efforts for major events such as the Olympic Games, World Championships, Tour de France and Giro d’Italia. The team said this was merely a matter of overall strategy.British Cycling used to be run by Sir Dave Brailsford, who, as general manager of Ineos Grenadiers, shares a major sponsor with Ainslie and is thought to have discussed with his sailing counterpart the philosophy of ‘marginal gains’ which brought his teams such high-profile success.Denying the allegations, Ainslie told the post-race press conference: “If we were sandbagging we did a bloody good job of it. It’s definitely the same boat just with quite a few modifications.Speaking earlier from his boat, shortly after Friday’s win, Ainslie said: “The whole boat has had a makeover. We can’t do a huge amount to the hull of the boat, but pretty much every component on the boat – be that the rig and sails, the rudder, the elevator, the foils, the systems how we control the boat – we pretty much changed everything.”Ainslie added: “Relief, I think, is probably the overriding emotion. It\u0027s been tough. Huge credit goes to the team here and back home. And to our friends at Mercedes F1 who have helped us out a lot.”But he warned that the competition was far from over. “We have to keep our heads down, keep our focus. Frankly we still have a long way to go,” he said.Indeed the team’s fortunes may yet be blown off course once more. Ineos Team UK sail again on Saturday, at about 4am UK time, in what are forecast to be lighter winds, precisely the kind of conditions which gave Britannia problems last month. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk travel news ban restrictions south america portugal brazil","story":"All travel corridors will be scrapped from 4am on Monday, when all arrivals will need to take a test before entering the UKShould I book a holiday for spring? Will vaccine passports open up our holidays? How travel to Europe will change after Brexit New UK testing entry rules: everything you need to know Sign up to the  Travel newsletter The Government has suspended all of the UK’s travel corridors over concerns about new Covid variants. The decision was announced at the daily briefing on Friday evening, just 24 hours after a ban was imposed on travellers from South America and Portugal. It means all overseas arrivals must now self-isolate for up to 10 days.  While holidays are currently banned under lockdown rules, the move will affect those already abroad, business travellers, as well as expats planning to return to the UK. It also casts serious doubts about the prospects of post-lockdown spring holidays. More than 50 countries deemed to have a low Covid risk are currently on the travel corridor list. However, all but nine (seven islands in the Caribbean, plus the Males and Bahrain) are not welcoming British holidaymakers, and most have closed their borders to all UK arrivals. Since last month those returning from non-corridor countries have had the option of cutting their quarantine period if they take a Covid test five days after they return. From Monday, all arrivals will need to carry evidence of a negative test taken no more than 72 hours before departure, or face a £500 fine.  Today\u0027s big travel news was that the Government will scrap all travel corridors from 4am on Monday. This means that everyone coming into the country will need to enter a ten day quarantine. The  understands this will be in force for at least four weeks.The new rules on testing for arrivals will also come into force on Monday. Everyone coming into the UK will need to prove they have tested negative for Covid-19, 72 hours before travel.All flights from Portugal have been halted, amid fears of the new Brazilian variant of Covid-19Travel ban on South America, Cape Verde and Portugal comes into force\u0027Don\u0027t take travel advice from me\u0027, says Transport Secretary on BBC Radio 4France toughens testing rules for UK arrivalsEasyJet holidays cancels bookings up to March 24Join us tomorrow, when we will bring you more live travel updates from around the world.Professor Chris Whitty has said it is very likely that the situation will improve by the spring but cautioned that it would not be completely back to how it was before the pandemic.What no-one thinks is that suddenly in spring it is all over and that is the whole thing done. What we expect is things to be substantially better than they are at the moment, he told a No 10 press conference.The hope is that is a kind of reasonable timeframe to be thinking about. But if we try to put a hard stop on this we will be caught out by events.But I think that broad timeframe still feels to me a reasonable one, provided what we are not expecting is completely back to two springs ago.“We already have a travel ban from the UK to all the major ski nations, so this doesn\u0027t change anything in the short term for British skiers,” says Iain Martin, host of The Ski Podcast.  “We still have three months for the infection rate in the UK to fall sufficiently to allow ski holidays to take place before the end of the season. It\u0027s still possible, if looking less likely,” he adds.Martin warns this won’t just impact skiers, but businesses in resorts, already hit hard by closures.“At this time of year, many resorts are dependent on the international market. Sadly, I think we\u0027ll see many family run restaurants, shops and hotels going out of business,” said Martin.Anyone travelling into the UK will soon be required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test, taken up to 72 hours prior to departure.This comes as part of a significant toughening of border controls, as the Government attempts to control the rapid rise of Covid cases in the country.So how will this work? How much will it cost? Who will need to take the test? And which countries will it apply to?Here, we explain what we know about the UK\u0027s new testing requirements.Even with the vaccine rollouts, it will be a long while until the rest of the world opens up to travel again, writes Guy de la Bédoyère.Read his comment piece here.Clive Wratten, CEO of the Business Travel Association, says:“The BTA recognises that public safety must come first. With all travel corridors closed from Monday, it is imperative that the Government issues detailed information on where essential travellers can get acceptable tests to meet the UK’s entry requirements. There are many essential workers who need to travel - medical researchers, energy suppliers and humanitarians to name a few. They must be able to undertake their vital work with confidence in procedures, and safe in the knowledge they can return home.”Travel restrictions are “necessary” to enable the UK to learn more about new variants of Covid-19 and vaccinate the vulnerable, says Richard Sinclair, managing director of ski travel agent SNO, who believe things might still change before the end of the ski season. Skiers are best off focusing on next winter, he says.“The big effect this will have on customers is that next year’s holidays will continue to book up even quicker, and the volume of holidays available may continue to reduce, as some of the less strong operators may not make it to next winter, if they don’t trade much at all this season,” he saidThe Prime Minister has said he wants to get to relaxations as soon as we reasonably can. However he cautioned that any relaxations would be dependant on the vaccine program working well and no new big changes in the virus as well as the results from the current lockdown.Asked about the new variant of the virus and plans to contain a new strain, Mr Johnson said that the Government has made great progress and we don\u0027t want to see that progress undone by a new variant, Tough measures at borders and airports will reduce the risk, Mr Johnson said. Commenting on the effectiveness of vaccines with regards to the new variant, Patrick Vallance said there is nothing to suggest a big change in disease severity with the new variant despite an increased risk of transmission. However he said it is possible that some future variants will get round vaccines.  “Consumer safety is paramount and although the removal of all travel corridors is regrettable, given the current trajectory of the virus it’s an understandable decision. With our borders effectively closed, the Government needs to provide urgent, tailored support for the inbound tourism industry. It simply cannot afford to continue excluding it from support channels, given its propensity to aid the UK’s economic recovery when we can travel again.“To save the summer season, it’s also imperative that Government signals that these new measures are only temporary, and that the Government consults with industry to put in place a clear roadmap to reopen the sector, when it’s safe to do so.”Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, the industry association representing UK-registered carriers, said:“Travel corridors were a lifeline for the industry last summer and the Government were right to bring them in when they did. But things change and there’s no doubting this is a serious health emergency and Ministers need to act to keep borders safe and the public protected. We therefore support this latest measure, on the assumption that we will work with Government – when the time is right – to remove these restrictions when it is safe to do so and start to open up our sector again, to support the UK’s economic recovery.”   Grant Shapps has Tweeted to explain the new tougher measures.The Prime Minister describes the new measures as vital, as day by day, hour by hour progress is being made in vaccinating people.He adds that 3.2 million people across the UK have received vaccines.The opening of Italy’s ski resorts has been postponed until mid-February, as the country remains in the grip of a pandemic that has killed more than 80,000 people, Nick Squires reports. Ski resorts were originally meant to open on January 7 but that was postponed until January 18.A closed chairlift is seen at the ski resort of Passo Tonale in the Dolomites which has become a virtual ghost townThe government decreed on Friday that they will not be allowed to open until February 15 and even that may not be set in stone.“I think it is unlikely that the ski season will resume on February 15,” said Valeria Ghezzi, the president of a national association of lift operators.There is an all too real risk that the entire season will be lost. We will only start to recover next Christmas. It is a disaster without precedent.Jeff Bezos\u0027s space exploration company Blue Origin could start taking passengers on a trip to the edge of space within the next few months.The company is aiming to launch its first crewed flight by early April, according to CNBC, which said a test flight on Thursday was one of two which would be taking place before the end of February.These flights are reportedly stable configuration flights, which mean that most of the major components of the space tourism rocket will remain the same. It trialled its upgraded capsule in Thursday\u0027s flight, and is expected to test the crew getting in and out of the ship in the next flight.Signs that Blue Origin is nearing its first human flight comes after a series of delays, including last year when staff pushed back over plans for them to travel from Washington to Texas in the midst of the pandemic. It marks a major step forward in Blue Origin\u0027s space tourism plans. Once it starts flying customers, up to six people are expected to be able to fit into one rocket. The journeys, which will be to the edge of space, are expected to last minutes.Read the full report, here.A probable cause in the Grand Canyon helicopter crash that killed five Britons was the pilot losing control due to tailwind conditions, a report has concluded.The aftermath of the helicopter crash in the Grand CanyonThe pilot told investigators that the aircraft encountered a violent gust of wind and began to spin, according to the report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US.Read the full report here.The Caribbean remains the best bet for a post-lockdown holiday, with eight destinations welcoming British travellers (but plenty of testing required). Antigua and BarbudaAll passengers 12 years and older must provide evidence of a negative test taken no more than seven days before arrival.

Only four of these are open to non-essential travellers, and these four are all imposing severe restrictions. All arrivals into Greece need to provide proof of a negative PCR test no more than 72 hours old. Anyone entering from the UK will also be asked to undergo a rapid test on arrival. Arrivals from the UK are currently required to self-isolate for 7 days in the event of a negative test result. In the event of a positive test result, travellers will have to isolate for at least 14 days. In either case, travellers will need to undertake a further PCR test at the end of their period of self-isolation.All persons arriving in to The Islands of Guernsey from anywhere in the world must self-isolate for 21 days on arrival, unless opting to take a test following 13 days of self-isolation and receive a negative result thereafter.All arrivals (except those from Northern Ireland) must show evidence of a negative PCR test carried out in the previous 72 hours. UK arrivals should self-isolate for 14 days. All UK regions (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) are classified with red travel status. Arrivals must take a test on arrival, a second on day 5, and another on day 10. During this time they must self-isolate.

Essential travelling is those to allow transit, entry or exit from Portugal of nationals from the European Union or from Schengen associated countries, and their family members, and foreign nationals legally staying in a Member State of the European Union, as well as those for professional purposes, of study, family reunion, health or humanitarian reasons.Commentators have questioned why Portugal has been added to the South America travel ban, but not Spain, so  Travel took a peek at the arrivals boards of both Madrid Airport and Lisbon Airport to see which country has more air links with South America. It seems the confusion is understandable. Today (January 15), Lisbon will welcome just two services from the continent (flights from Recife and Sao Paulo), but Madrid will see 12. France will only allow non-EU nationals to enter with a PCR test, rather than the quicker, readily-available rapid antigenlateral flow test.The new rules will come into force on Monday (January 18).The quicker tests have been used by truck drivers transporting goods across the Channel between Britain and France.Asked about reports France would not recognise the red circle antigen test for people trying to enter the country from Monday, Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: I think this is in reference to the French requiring what they call the PCR test.First of all, no one should be going to France. No one should be travelling.Secondly, we have a particular arrangement with the French regarding the hauliers, this is the lorry drivers, with tests which are called the lateral flow tests.And that remains in place at the moment.Epidemiologist Dr Mike Tildesley suggested the South America travel ban which came into force at 4am on Friday is slightly late but will still minimise the risk of the new coronavirus variant found in Brazil from entering the UK.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Dr Tildesley said: We always have this issue with travel bans of course, that we\u0027re always a little bit behind the curve.With Covid we need to remember that when you develop symptoms you could have been infected up to a couple of weeks ago.So it\u0027s really important that these travel bans come in quickly so that we can prevent any risk. My understanding is that there haven\u0027t really been any flights coming from Brazil for about the past week, so hopefully the immediate travel ban should really minimise the risk.He added that scientists will know in the next few days whether the ban has had a significant effect.Germany has reported 22,368 new cases of coronavirus, taking the country over the two million mark. Angela Merkel is pondering a tougher lockdown as Germany exceeds two million casesThere have been 44,994 Covid-related deaths in the country.There\u0027s no contest, for Oliver Smith.My dream destination is a place where Britons are always welcomed with open arms, where the sun always shines, and which doesn’t involve a long flight. What I want is unspoilt island life, unpretentious food and accommodation, quiet beaches, walks through green, mountainous interiors, and a complete removal from the stresses of modern life.Allow Oliver to transport you to his dream destination, here.The Transport Secretary has insisted the British public should not take travel advice from him as growing pressure mounts on the Government to make sure the Brazilian strain does not derail the UK\u0027s vaccine plan. Pressed on whether it was wise for pensioners who have had the vaccine to book summer holidays, Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I am the last person you should take travel advice on this from.I remember about this time last year, or a little bit later, being asked whether I would book a summer holiday. We then had the travel corridors and I did book, I went to Spain with my family.And, within an hour of getting there, I, myself, put Spain... took them out of the travel corridor, meaning that I needed to come home and start my quarantine, leaving my family there.So, don\u0027t take any travel advice from me.Questions have been raised about whether or not the Government acted quickly enough to ban travel from South America and Portugal.Mr Shapps said they had been brought in because we do not want to be tripping up at this last moment.January 14 new cases: 68,656January 14 new deaths: 1,151The Brazilian coronavirus variant may infect people who have already recovered from Covid, scientists said as they called for urgent investigations into whether the new mutation can escape previous immunity.Research published last year suggested that 76 per cent of people in Manaus had contracted coronavirus by October, which should have severely limited onward spread of the virus. However, the city saw an unexpected surge of new cases last month and has now declared a state of emergency, with hospitals reaching 100 per cent capacity. Read the full report here.Travel expert Paul Charles, CEO of the PC Agency, told  Travel:Grant Shapps Tweeted last night to update the UK\u0027s travel corridors list. Chile, the Azores and Madeira lost their corridors due to the South AmericaPortugal travel ban. Qatar, Aruba and Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba lost their corridors too.Anyone who has visited the following countries over the past ten days will no longer be granted access to the UK (excluding British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK).Portugal (including Madeira and the Azores)Danny Callaghan, chief executive of the Latin American Travel Association, said: “It is vital that this travel ban is reviewed on an ongoing basis subject to the epidemiological situation and the associated risks and not just forgotten about or kicked down the road endlessly.“There is no doubt that the region’s tourism sector has been hit hard by the economic fallout which has meant that travel to the region, for the most part, has ground to a halt.

This includes .million  - or nearly  per cent - of over s and more than , older care home residents - or nearly  per cent of the total.No.  said . million people have been vaccinated in England, , in Scotland, , in Wales and , in Northern Ireland. Have you had your coronavirus vaccine  Let us know in the comments belowBullish Health Secretary took to Twitter to report more than . million people have now been vaccinated across the UK.He wrote on Twitter: Fantastic that over . million people have now been vaccinated across the UK, including almost  per cent of over s and almost  per cent of care home residents. THANK YOU to everyone playing your part in our national effort to stay at home as we accelerate the Covid vaccine roll-out.At todayaposs Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson said almost  per cent of care home residents in England have received a coronavirus vaccine. Boris Johnson said % of the over-s and almost % of care home residents have received at least one dose. “We are steadily protecting those most at risk,” he told the press conference. But he warned “this is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our inidual efforts. So please stay at home, please protect the NHS and save lives.” He added: “What we can’t have is any  sense of security so that we, as it were, lt the restrictions altogether and then the disease really runs riot in the younger generations.”  The Prime Minister said around one third of Covid patients admitted to hospital are under , while a quarter are under . “So it can affect and does affect huge numbers of younger people as well, often very badly, and the risk is that those numbers would be greatly inflatedwe let go too soon in circumstances where the disease was really rampant. “That is not to say that I don’t want to try to get to relaxations as soon as we reasonably can - but there are a lot of things that have to go right.” Mr Johnson paid particular tribute to vaccine teams in north-west Lincolnshire, Sunderland and Morecambe Bay, where more than  per cent of care home residents have been given a vaccine.  The majority of care home residents in England are expected to be vaccinated against Covid- by the end of the week, health officials have said. NHS England has told GPs that it expects care home residents and staff at homes across England to be vaccinated by the end of this week, or by January  at the latest. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: We are steadily building up that immunity, that protection, for the vulnerable, for the NHS and for us all. So when the call comes, please do get the jab and in the meantime, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.  Care groups have been calling on the NHS to publish daily breakdowns on how many people in priority groups, including care home residents, have received a coronavirus vaccine. While politicians have given ad hoc updates on what percentage of residents have received the jab, care groups want daily updates and say the current lack of detail seems unhelpful in the extreme. Regular updates will also enable better scrutiny of whether the Government is on track to meet its targets. The Government’s chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said some of the new iants may be able to “get round” the vaccines.

That certainly isnapost what he - or a large number of his Cabinet colleagued - used to think. Last night, The Financial Times reported that the -hour working week could be scrapped under Government plans for a post-Brexit overhaul of labour laws. This morning, Mr Kwarteng insisted that the Government wanted to improve workplace protections – not reduce them. “We are not going to lower the standards of workers’ rights,” he tweeted. “The UK has one of the best workers’ rights records in the world – going further than the EU in many areas. “We want to protect and enhance workers’ rights going forward, not row back on them.”  But Mr Kwarteng is one of the authors, alongside the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel and International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, of a controversial  pamphlet which argued that Brits were “among the worst idlers in the world”.Titled aposBritannia Unchainedapos only one of its authors, ex-Universities Minister Chris Skidmore is not in the cabinet. It argued for tearing up rules which protect workers and the environment, Euroscepticism, and lower tax rate. The pamphlet argued that the UK’s culture “rewards laziness” and that “too many people in Britain prefer a lie-in to hard work”. That was not Kwarteng last foray into arguing for right-wing economic policy before becoming responsible for a major government department. In  he wrote Industrial Policy for the st Century, which argued that called for the minimum wage and public sector pay to be regionalised’. He also claimed that in “low wage areas” the unorm national minimum wages and wage rates in the public sector crowds out the private sector - and should therefore be lower than wages in “high wage areas”. It also called for start-up business to be exempt from a range or taxes and employment protections for three years.

Conservative MPs from Red Wall seats signed a letter to the Chancellor demanding the temporary uplt to the leline benefit stays in place until lockdown ends. Boris Johnson signalled this week that the £-a-year increase brought in during the pandemic would end in April as planned. The Prime Minister told MPs on Wednesday he would rather see a focus on jobs and a growth in wages than focusing on welfare. He also claimed “the best thing is to get people into employment - despite the fact % of the .million Universal Credit recipients are already in work. Labour plans to force a Commons vote on making the uplt permanent on Monday. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned that the cut could see another , children pushed into poverty. The influential Northern Research Group, representing Tories in the North and Midlands, put pressure on Mr Sunak for more support in the Budget in March. They want the Universal Credit uplt and business rate rebates to continue until lockdown ends, VAT slashed to % for businesses in the leisure and tourism sector, and stamp duty abolished for homes under £,. Chairman Jake Berry said: Lockdowns - although necessary while we wait for the vaccine to be rolled out - only entrench and compound disadvantage already felt by those communities this Government has promised to level up. Whilst we welcome the unprecedented support provided by this Government for those impacted by this virus, to relinquish support now would cause long-term damage to large parts of the North and weaken our recovery. Tory former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb tweeted: Good to see colleagues in the Northern Research Group of MPs join call to extend Universal Credit uplt. UC has been especially important in Red Wall seats supporting low wage workers and those losing jobs.

So let me reunite you with the fury you felt, three years ago this week, when government outsource firm Carillion went bust owing £billion, destroying , direct jobs and costing taxpayers £million, due to what MPs called a “chronic lack of accountability and professionalism”. You were furious to discover its bosses paid out millions in idends as the firm was going under and its pension deficit was soaring to £million. You no doubt fired off ­expletives when you read that Carillion’s chairman Philip Greenwas such a part of the Tory chumocracy that David Cameron made him adviser on “corporate responsibility” and gave him a CBE for “services to business”.And despite three profit warnings in the six months before it collapsed, the Tories awarded them contracts worth £billion. And you won’t be surprised to hear that, so far, none of the disgraced firm’s bosses have been held accountable.Or that, this week, with  hours to go before a three-year legal deadline expired, ministers finally decided to take action against eight former ­Carillion directors which could see them face a boardroom ban.Don’t hold your breath though. They’ll be OK. They usually are. Take Chartwells, which this week was exposed for handing out pathetically inadequate free school meal parcels, effectively stealing food out of the mouths of the country’s poorest kids, while ripping off the taxpayer. Its parent company, Compass, had previously admitted supplying meals with horse meat to schools in Northern Ireland and a subsidiary firm serving food in Canadian prisons laced with listeria.But onwards it prospered, racking up revenues last year of £billion. Until last month, Chartwells’ chairman was Paul Walsh, a Tory donor who signed a letter praising George Osborne’s austerity policies before the  General ­Election.Unsurprisingly, the Government has given his firm £million worth of catering contracts since, making it the UK’s biggest school meal provider.

This pledge was a key part of their appeal to voters in traditionally-Labour seats vital to keeping Boris Johnson in Number Ten. As I expected, it has proved to be a downright lie. Tory ministers are talking to business bosses about a bonfire of rights at work, especially safeguards brought in by Europe. With the go-ahead from Downing Street, the Business Department is drawing up plans to scrap the -hour maximum week, slash breaks at work and exclude overtime from holiday pay calculation. At first light, this package of so-called “liberalisation” measures, like relieving employers of the duty to log detailed daily reporting of working hours, may not seem very radical. But it is a classic Tory thin-end-of-the-wedge strategy. It’s not just what comes first, but what follows that really hammers rights at work. Thatcher’s anti-union legislation was a salami-slicing exercise. It took years before the shackles now in place got on to the statute book – where they largely remained under New Labour. This is the first step on a similar, post-Europe road. The Tories are instinctively hostile to any improvement to le at work, especiallyit comes from the EU. It beggars belief that during the greatest health crisis for a century, during the deepest economic recession for  years, that this government can find the time and energy to chisel away at hard-won workers’ rights.Do you agree with Paul  Have your say in the comment section below."},{"url":null,"title":"boy 11 left red eyes","story":"NewsBoy, , left with red eyes and hands after contracting rare Covid-linked illnessOliver Shultz needed treatment in intensive care at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh after he contracted Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome having caught the coronavirusmirrorShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsOliver Schultz suffered muscle ache and blood shot eyes after contracting a Covid- linked condition \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Oliver was brought to UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh by his mum, who thought he was just low on fluids. He tested positive for Covid- before an infectious disease doctor diagnosed him with MIS-C - the eleventh case the hospital had treated.Aimee Schultz told WPXI : “The scariest thing for my husband and I is not knowing. It’s new, so there’s no research.We don’t know what the long-term effects will be for him, what his future will look like. Oliver was left with severe muscle aches, a rash and an inflamed heart and needed treatment in intensive care.  His family are now fundraising to try and pay off some of the expenses of the linked to the illness. The mounting medical bills, insurance company phone calls while still in ICU to collect payments, and a projection of six months to heal Oliver’s heart that was badly damaged by Covid- and MIS-C have left this family with chronic health concerns, financial fears, and a need for community support, the GoFundMe page reads. Oliver has been allowed home now where he is recovering.“I’m hopeful I can get back to riding very soon, the young horse enthusiast told ActionNews.“It’s what I love to do and I don’t feel the same without riding my horse every day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"covid finally retreat cases now","story":"NewsNew data shows Covid- cases falling in parts of England - see how your area is affectedA majority of regions in England have seen their coronavirus case rates fall as Professor Neil Ferguson hails sign of plateauing and Professor Jonathan Van-Tam talks of the last few furlongs of this race, like in the Grand NationalmirrorShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporterJane Kirby:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video high-street-pharmacies-start-vaccines-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

While yesterday the Department of Health reported the highest ever death toll in the coronavirus pandemic so far - , - the case rate is dipping in London and other major regions, the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England says. In London, which continues to have the highest rate of any region, the rate of new cases stood at . per , people in the seven days to January , down from ,. in the previous week. The other regions recording a week-on-week fall are the East Midlands, eastern England, north-east England, south-east England and Yorkshire  the Humber. Three regions recorded a week-on-week increase: north-west England, south-west England and the West Midlands. What is the situation like where you live  Have your say in the comments section Yorkshire  the Humber continues to have the lowest rate: ., down from .. In yesterdayaposs daily figures from the Department of Health, the number of new cases reported in a -hour period was , - which is down on the record number of , reported on Wednesday last week. It comes as a senior epidemiologist says some parts of England are showing a plateau in cases of Covid-, while the rate of growth across the country as a whole is slowing. Professor Neil Ferguson, whose early modelling of Covid- made him a key player in the UKaposs first lockdown, said he thinks the current wave of the epidemic may be coming under control in some regions. In an interview with BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Prof Ferguson said: I think itaposs much too early to say exactly when case numbers are going to start coming down, but in some NHS regions in England and in Wales thereaposs sign of plateauing. London in particular is seeing a drop in the number of positive coronavirus tests, alongside the South East, he said. At the moment, it looks like in London in particular, and a couple of other regions - the South East and East of England -hospital admissions may even have plateaued, though itaposs hard to tell theyaposre coming down.  It has to be said this is not being seen everywhere. Both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas but, overall, at a national level weaposre seeing the rate of growth slow. In yesterdayaposs update of the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England, for the seven days to January , of the  local areas saw a fall in their case rates and two were unchanged. While saw a rise in case rates. Prof Ferguson, who is director of the Medical Research Councilaposs Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said he would expect to see case numbers continue to come down slowly at a national level but with regional iations.  It will take longer though for hospital admissions - daily admissions - to start coming down and even longer for hospital bed occupancy to come down, he said. Asked how many more weeks of rising hospital admissions and deaths the UK could be looking at, he said: It critically depends on whether the lockdown weaposre in the moment will actually control growth in all areas. But I would hope that hospital admissions might plateau, instead of keep going up, some time in the next week. Hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks and deaths maybe even for longer.Weaposre going to be well over , deaths a day, even measured by the date people die rather than the date deaths are reported, before numbers start coming down. Prof Ferguson said the total number of deaths in the UK unfortunately is going to be well over ,, thereaposs nothing we can do about that now. Only about % of the population has been infected so far, which had resulted in , deaths, he said. So we have to get to very high levels of vaccine coverage in those vulnerable groups before we can reduce the risk of having basically the same number of deaths again.  If we only get up to  per cent coverage in in the elderly, for instance, that still leaves  per cent unprotected plus everybody . We can still get a very large epidemic, which unfortunately could kill many, many people, so what the modelling and all the analysis and all the groups feeding into Sagesays is, we need to be very cautious in how we relax restrictions and try to ensure we get as high a vaccine coverage as possible. Askedthere could be restrictions for many months to come, he said: Yes, and we canapost predict all of these things in advance. We couldnapost have predicted this new iant coming up, but the new iant without doubt will make the relaxation of restrictions more dficult because it is substantially more transmissible.  So it will be a gradual process to the autumn. Prof Ferguson suggested that the requirement to isolate after coming into contact with a person with coronavirus could be relaxed for people who have recently had the virus, such as NHS workers, but said this was a question for policymakers. It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said three million coronavirus vaccines have now been administered across the UK. He tweeted that he was delighted with the news, adding: Weaposre accelerating the Covid vaccine rollout across the UK.  Prof Fergusonaposs comments came as some large high street pharmacies, including Boots and Superdrug, began rolling out Covid- vaccines. Six stores across England can administer the jabs from Thursday as the Government aims to hit its target of vaccinating around  million of those most at-risk by mid-February. People who are eligible for a vaccine will be contacted and invited to make an appointment through a new national booking service. This gives them the option of having the vaccine at a pharmacy or in a GP-led vaccination centre. Elsewhere, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, has told the Sun newspaper: We are probably in the last few furlongs of this race, like in the Grand National. We just have a couple more fences. We have just got to stick with it.  Amid the warnings of struggling hospitals, the Governmentaposs leading scientist Sir Patrick Vallance has warned the country is in for a pretty grim period of deaths which will not reduce quickly. He told ITVaposs Peston programme that high death numbers will carry on for some weeks. Elsewhere, Public Health Englandaposs Siren study found that antibodies from past infection provide % protection against reinfection for at least five months. Although reinfections in people with antibodies were rare, the researchers identied  potential reinfections among , people who had had Covid- previously, putting them at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Full list of all the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England Here is Wednesdayaposs update of the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England. The figures, for the seven days to January , are based on tests carried out in laboratoriesand in the wider community . The rate is expressed as the number of new cases per , people. Data for the most recent four dayshas been excluded as it is incomplete and does not reflect the true number of cases. Of the  local areas in England, have seen a rise in case rates, have seen a fall and two are unchanged.

Despite the deadly unseen menace that stalks this corridor, the heroes staffing it are learning fast how to save more lives. The Mirror visited an intensive care unit “in the eye of the storm” and heard how “it is going to get worse before it gets better”. For some reason I was expecting shouting and some degree of panic, but what we saw was calm, quiet determination. The team even find moments to share a joke and gentle laughter breaks out. Have you had your vaccine  Let us know about the experience by contacting us at webnews@mirror We stand in the hallway that separates the three areas of the intensive care unit at Wolverhampton’s New Cross Hospital. Floor-to-ceiling glass walls have been installed to split the previously open plan ICU for Covid and non-Covid patients. Now all patients here have the deadly coronavirus. Better ways of managing patients cannot hide the fact however that many more young people are being admitted and “this time no-one is immune”. “They are definitely getting younger,” ICU nurse Suki Dhadda, aged , explains “At the beginning of this pandemic they were at least in their s and s. Now they are in the s, s and s. “We are seeing that no-one is immune this time around. People say ‘this is what you were trained for’, but we were never trained for a global pandemic. “When you are treating patients in here with this virus who are in their s, not far from my age, we are not used to this. “When they realise the severity of their situation they are shocked.”  Infection rates may finally have started to level off in the South East but are still rising in the North West and Midlands. New Cross has around  beds and  of them are occupied by patients with Covid-. It has around  new people admitted with the virus every day and is not expecting a peak until at least the end of January. Many more younger people getting infected than during the first wave, so those needing hospital treatment has also shot up.  But when it comes to deaths the under-s make up .% during the winter wave, down from .% in the spring. We hear that the man to our right in his s is “incredibly sick”, hooked up to ventilator and dialysis machines. His mouth hangs open to one side to allow in the pipe carrying oxygen supplies that is for now keeping him alive. Others in this same comatose state lie face down on their fronts having been moved - or proned - to allow more oxygen in. A bell rings and a “runner” in the corridor strides passed to deliver medicine to one of the fully kitted-up nurses in one of the three glass ICU sections.  Once in full PPE then kit is not removed for at least two hours as constantly removing items is an infection risk. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Brian McKaig acknowledges that once they step through the glass it is “intense, hot and dficult to communicate”. He said: “There are not many conditions that can leave a fit -year-old in ICU but we’re now seeing that Covid is one of them. “We’re absolutely in the eye of the storm and it is probably going to get worse before it gets better. “What’s demoralising at the moment is we are in lockdown and everyone is coming in saying the roads are as busy as before lockdown. “We can see the impact of this in our patients and our staff. We are really creaking.”  Despite the seeming miracles they perform saving people from the brink of death each day, it is important to remember these NHS staff are not superhuman. Like any of us when exhausted and stressed, they will have their off days. Some of them are genuinely struggling. Frightened looking older patients can be seen wearing huge oxygen masks covering most of their face. The hospital has had to open up adjoining “CPAP wards” where last ditch efforts are made to prevent deteriorating Covid patients needing to be placed in an induced coma in ICU.  Continuous Positive Airway Pressuremachines are believed to have been used on Boris Johnson. They work by pushing an air-oxygen mix into the mouth and nose at a continuous rate, keeping airways open and increasing the amount of oxygen entering the lungs. If this fails patients must be heavily sedated and put on a ventilator which delivers air via a tube down the windpipe in to the lungs. Muscle wastage alone means even patients who survive this can face a month of recovery time for every day they are in this state. The influx of younger Covid patients who have soldiered often arrive when it is too late for CPAP.  Suki said: “These younger patients are able to compensate so that when they come in they’re gasping for air with really low oxygen levels. “The only safe thing is to pop them on a ventilator.” On the way in we had passed a tent set up outside as a ‘Staff Rest Area’. There exhausted medics sat apart on wooden benches with haunted looks on their faces.  They enter the ICU via the ‘Donning Room’ where they don masks, visors and gowns before ing to the fray. Suki said: “The PPE is a barrier. Some elderly people wake up here and are bewildered because they don’t know where they are. “ICU is a scary enough environment without being able to see our smiles.” Before leaving the wards medics remove their layers of PPE in a ‘Doffing Room’.  Then they have the option of debriefing sessions with staff trained in trauma management. We hear how adrenaline often gets staff through shts who can then struggle once they get a few days off to think about it. Sara Lawley, operational nurse manager, said: “I don’t think I’m being unfair when I say that after the first surge, when it was busier up north, we thought we had got away with it. “We never imagined we could be working at these sort of capacity levels.  “I’ve got many staff seeing a psychologist that we’ve had since the first surge. ICU nurses are very good at just keeping going.” New Cross Hospital has one in ten of its staff absent and nationally , NHS staff either have Covid or are self-isolating. Others NHS staff from theatre assistants to dental nurses have been erted to prevent ICUs from being overwhelmed. These most severely ill patients require one fully trained intensive care nurse each. Currently it is three or four patients to a nurse. Healthcare workers thrust in to another world by the global pandemic are desperately appealing to the public to help them.  More than once in our interviews staff refer to the pre-Covid era as “peace time”. Suki said: “When we had the first Covid patients in I had been on annual leave. The night before I went in to work I cried. “We had read about it abroad and healthcare workers dying and we didn’t know what we were going in to. “We are all worried about taking it home to our families. I live with my parents and grandparents and we didn’t know what risk we were putting our families in. “My dad is diabetic and hypertensive. I used to go home and not talk to anyone until I had got in the shower and felt I had got the Covid off me.” Research by University College London published just this week found that an ICU operating at more than  per cent capacity meant patients were  per cent more likely to die. This extra risk is equivalent to a patient being up to  years older. Intensive care wards at New Cross are currently operating at “between % and %”, Dr McKaig admitted.  “The only time we get a bit of capacity is when two or three patients die at the same time,” he said. “We can only hope that people stay home and take up the vaccine when it is offered. Those are the only things that will get us out of this situation.” The people running our most precious public service are not superhuman and many are struggling.

Kizu Stanford claims he was let go by Lloyds Bank after a video of the bus confrontation went viral online. The -year-old was sitting on the bus in West Bromwich on October  last year when a couple allegedly began slinging verbal abuse towards a maskless-mum, he claims. A teen girl stuck up for the woman, who was with her young daughter, only to be subject to racist abuse, Mr Stanford said. In footage that went viral online, a man then allegedly kicks the teen in the face as he attempted to get off the bus. She can be heard screaming oh my god as she stands up to confront her alleged attacker.  At that point, Mr Stanford gets up and wrestles a man to the floor. Mr Stanford can be heard shouting: What the f *** are you doing. You piece of s*** I will murder you.” At one point he appears to stamp on the man. The former bank clerk from Wednesbury, who was wearing the companyaposs unorm at the time, then puts a man in a headlock and throws him off the bus. After Mr Stanford told a colleague about the incident, which quickly went viral online, he claims he was suspended without investigation at the bankaposs Great Bridge branch. One week before his birthday on November  he was dismissed on the grounds of gross misconduct. “You become a folklore online but a villain by the company,” he said. “As soon as I saw the man kick the young girl I knew I had to act, but I didn’t for one second think that my actions would lead to me losing my job. He added: I don’t regret it at all, but I do regret the fact that Lloyds Bank has chosen to sack me.” BTU, a union for Lloyds staff, has launched an appeal to reinstate Mr Stanfordaposs job. A union spokesman claimed: “No reasonable employer would have dismissed him. “It is important to note that the police scrutinised Kizu Stanford’s actions in detail and took no action against him whatsoever. The spokesman said Mr Stanfordaposs employment prospects have been severely damaged as a result of being dismissed.

Detective Constable Ashleigh Nelson said: Incidents of this nature are very rare but I understand the concern it may have caused in the local community. I want to reassure people we are doing everything we can to find out who is responsible.

Nancy said: It would be so much easier to say, yeah, off you go kids, bye bye, I get four or five hours on my own, but Iaposm not risking their health. I donapost think the Government knows its a**e from its elbow.Have you been home schooling for as long as Nancy  Email webnews@mirrorTia stopped going to school before the national lockdown was announced and sheaposs not ed since. Tyler ed briefly in September but couldnapost cope with the changes made to make his classroom Covid complaint and ended up having a breakdown. When asked when she would be happy for both her children to be back in school full time again, Nancy is unsure. She said: I donapost want any COVID deaths to be honest with you. I mean, itaposs out of control. Iaposm glad that I am a really strong person, and Iaposll do anything to protect my children..  So I know of other people that wonapost speak uptheyaposre told theyaposre going to get fined, and they were sending their kids to school, because they were scared. Itaposs all scare tactics. You know, as a parent, I think you should have a right. You know, Iaposm a single mum, Iaposve got three special needs kids, so my children are extremely vulnerable. But Iaposve fought and fought. Theyaposre saying aposthis is safe, youaposre safeapos, and then itaposs not, and then it is, like, I donapost think the Government knows [...] they just donapost understand it. [With coronavirus] you canapost see it. So, you know,there was a gunman on the loose outside or a sniper, you wouldnapost go outside, would you, because thereaposs a chance that youaposre going to get shot. Fortunately for Nancy, both of her childrenaposs schools have been very supportive.  Tia was due to move to secondary school in September, but after a risk assessment they agreed with Nancy that she was vulnerable and could stay at home. Weaposve just got loads of books, and weaposre teaching her le skills, Nancy said. But sheaposs happy. This is the main thing. Sheaposs got a mental age of about a five year old, so sheaposs happy to play with dolls. So sheaposs really not a problem. And Iaposm glad the school decided that sheaposs too vulnerable to go in because it saved me a massive fight. Nancy says the one-to-one interaction she is able to give Tia at home means her hand control has improved in the last year, but she does worry about her missing out on friendships at school. Tyler is currently having some one-to-one Zoom lessons at home with Nancy describing his experience as been really quite bad.  He was in school, I think, for a couple of weeks, but couldnapost cope with all the changes, all the rules, and [had a] major meltdown, said Nancy. He was put on a reduced timetable. So he was only in school for two or three hours a day. It had a massive impact on his mental health. She added: He also struggles to learn virtually. He canapost go on to a Zoom, and watch what the teacher is trying to show him. He literally has to have somebody behind him. Fortunately some money was provided by the local council to help Tyler and other children with similar needs. In addition to his one-to-one Zoom lessons he is also being given more creative and practical work to do, such as learning how to rewire a plug.

It found that those who suffered from the coronavirus and had symptoms had a  per cent chance of avoiding falling unwell again with the disease over the next five months. When people who had caught the virus but had been asymptomatic were taken into account, that number fell to  per cent. PHEaposs Siren Study will now continue to see how long natural immunity tends to last for among people whoaposve caught the bug. According to an overview of multiple dferent studies into Covid-, around one in five people who catch the virus experience no symptoms. With .million people having officially tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to Department of Health data, hundreds of thousands may have caught the bug and acquired immunity without suffering any symptoms. Many others who believed early last year, when scientists thought the virus was still contained in China, that they had the cold or flu, may in fact have caught coronavirus and now be immune. Here is a list of the telltale signs that you may have had Covid- and might as a result now be immune. It should be remembered that people who have caught the virus donapost have a free pass to start living like everything is normal. Professor Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and the Siren study lead, warned: We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts. Crucially, we believe people may still be able to pass the virus on. This means, evenyou believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections, but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others. Memory loss and brain fog  An unpleasant and in a lot of cases long term effect of the coronavirus is a kind of mental fogginess. Many sufferers of long Covid have reported having trouble thinking clearly for months after getting over the first part of disease. On Thursday Labouraposs Andrew Gwynne said that his memory was shot to pieces. The MP explained he began to feel grotty and run down in March, went on to display Covid- symptoms, and his initial illness lasted for about  days although he still feels the effects today. The MP for Denton and Reddish told the Commons: My condition is not as severe as it was even just a few months back, there have been real improvements, but itaposs been a hard slog to get here. For the first seven months or so the exhaustion came back frequently and to the point where doing just simple tasks around the house brought me out in massive sweats like Iaposd run the London Marathon. I had lots of dizzy spells, Iaposve never had vertigo before this, and oh the brain fog - in a job where you have to be razor sharp, my short-term memory is shot to pieces. Iaposve had to learn to pace myself, trying to push my limits would set me back. Covid tongue  According to Professor Tim Spector more and more people are heading to doctors complaining of issues with their tongue. The Kingaposs College London epidemiologist, who heads the Covid Symptom Study App, said that the disease seems to cause tongue changes including pain, discolouration, swelling or a strange texture. Seeing increasing numbers of Covid tongues and strange mouth ulcers, Professor Spector tweeted. If you have a strange symptom or even just headache and fatigue stay at home! If you are suffering from tongue issues it might be because youaposve had Covid-, or that youaposve got one of a number of other conditions which can be the result of poor mouth hygiene, smoking or an unhealthy diet. Stomach ache  Some coronavirus patients have suffered stomach aches for weeks after catching the bug. The American Journal of Gastroenterology published a study suggesting the virus could cause digestive problems such as diarrhoea. It analysed data from  patients in China, discovering that . per cent of them had tummy issues such as vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea when they were first hospitalised. This is another symptom which may indicate youaposve had the coronavirus, a host of other conditions or simply too large a dinner last night. Eye infections This symptom is a relatively rare one, but still thought to impact around  per cent of the millions of people whoaposve had the coronavirus. Doctors warned eye infections may be another sign of Covid-. Chy Earnest, a nurse at the Le Care Centre in Washington, said that red eyes are the ‘single most important’ sign that patients have COVID-. Speaking to CNN she explained: “They have, like...allergy eyes. The white part of the eye is not red. Itaposs more like they have red eye shadow on the outside of their eyes.” Other people have reported symptoms like conjunctivitis. Fatigue  After weeks of lockdown in the depths of the winter, it may seem dficult to tell coronavirus linked fatigue with general burnout. Yet sufferers of this common long Covid symptom compare it more to a aposflatliningapos sense of exhaustion than typical tiredness. The symptom can have a crippling impact on peopleaposs lives and turn the simplest of tasks into a huge struggle. If youaposve been finding yourself low on energy, then you may be one of  per cent of people a World Health Organisation study found had Covid linked fatigue. Laboured breathing  The images of people struggling to breath on ventilators will be some of the most enduring of the pandemic. While the horrors acute patients suffer in intensive care wards are well understood, research into the impact seemingly mild cases of Covid- can have on lungs is only just beginning. A lot of people who were asymptomatic to begin with have found themselves struggling to breath in the months since being infected. If you are finding it hard to catch a breath oryour partner has noticed youaposre breathing more heavily than normal, then you may be suffering from Covid-linked lung damage. Hair loss  Although not one of the tell-tale signs weaposve been told to watch out for during the pandemic, hair loss may indicate youaposve had the coronavirus. Doctors have long linked unexpected balding with recovery from fevers. Enid Child shared a picture of her hair loss months after both her and her son tested positive for coronavirus The grandmother-of-four, from Pencoe, originally fell ill in mid September, and tested positive for the virus days after. But it was not until she was referred to her doctor in November that she learnt her hair loss was linked to Covid-, usually emerging in patients months after their diagnosis. The -year-old said: The photo I posted was one morningaposs brush worth. Thataposs why I bagged it - I was going to my doctors to get my first lot of bloods to check my iron levels and the rest because my iron levels had dropped. My practice nurse was quite shocked when she saw me. She asked does it come out voluntarily. I just put my hand up - by then my hair was waist- - and ran my hand through my hair and I got another handful. She said aposI think you better speak to a doctorapos. The doctor phoned me that afternoon and that was when it was confirmed it was an effect of long Covid. She added: My hair has gone really really thin. Yes it still covers my scalp and things but I have lost an awful lot of hair. Anxiety and insomnia  Another symptom that is not the easiest one to spot - given the mental strain many are under each day at the moment - but researchers believe Covid- can lead to anxiety, depression and insomnia. Scientists from the University of Oxford analysed electronic health records of  million people in the USA, including over , Covid- patients. Their analysis revealed that in the three months following a positive Covid- test, one in five survivors were found to get a diagnosis of anxiety, depression or insomnia for the first time. That’s about twice as likely as for people without Covid-, according to the researchers. Hearing loss and tinnitus In November a study was published which showed many people suffered from hearing loss for months after catching the bug. Researchers from Anglia Ruskin University looked at the hearing problems affecting Covid- patients, both in the short and long term.In the study, the team analysed , Covid- patients with tinnitus - a condition that causes a constant ringing or buzzing in the ears.The analysis revealed that  per cent of the participants experienced a worsening of their tinnitus amid their Covid- infection. And while the majority of participants had pre-existing tinnitus, a small number reported that their conditions as initially triggered by developing Covid- symptoms. Dizziness  Another classic sign of Long Covid, and one which seems to sneak up on a lot of previously asymptomatic patients, is dizziness. Feeling suddenly wobbly or unsteady on your feet may be a sign youaposve had the virus. Dean Dobson was off for work for months due to a particularly bad case of long Covid. “Itaposs the worst thing Iaposve ever had to experience in my le,” he said.

Lee Warren, who works for Cobra Biologics, a firm which signed a supply agreement with AstraZeneca to help manufacture the vaccine, was contacted by police in connection with an alleged breach of Covid- restrictions. The force decided to take no further action. It is alleged the -year-old travelled around  miles from his home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire to a second property in Rothbury, Northumberland last week and stayed for several days. The visit sparked consternation among villagers with news of his arrival with his we and child posted on Facebook. One local resident told the Mirror: “Given his job, he should have known better than to travel all that way.” It is believed he arrived at the £, second home - used as a holiday let - earlier this month. Before the third England lockdown came into effect on January , Northumberland was in Tier , which meant all members of the public had to stay at home” unless they had a “reasonable excuse”. Mr Warren is thought to have left last week having receiving a warning from police. One man defended him, writing on Facebook that people who reported them were ‘idiots’. “The family live some miles away but also have a home and relatives here,” he wrote.  “He is a key worker in the production of the Covid vaccine and now has to work from home. “Their broadband strength is appalling.. percent the strength we enjoy in Rothbury, and as a result he cannot carry out his work and video conferencing. “Hence their journey to their home here - just before lockdown.” But an elderly neighbour close to the £,, stone-built second home said: “It is very inappropriate and makes you think of Dominic Cummings. “He definitely should have known better.” Another added: “I have not seen my husband for a year due to work. So I am not very sympathetic.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad reduced tears after reading","story":"NewsDad left close to tears after reading note son brought home from lonely pupilThe young boy has been widely praised after his proud dad shared a note he sent to a fellow pupil at his school, who was new, after noticing he was strugglingmirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonExclusives Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe boy has been showered with praise \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Brittany Bankhead-Kendall shared a scan of three sets of lungs side-by-side. Compared to a healthy lung - which shows little damage in the scan - a smokeraposs lung appears to have a light cloudy film. The x-ray of the Covid lung is much darker white, indicating heavy scarring. Dr Bankhead-Kendall, an assistant professor of surgery with Texas Tech University, in Lubbock, tweeted: Post-COVID lungs look worse than any type of terrible smokeraposs lung weaposve ever seen. And they collapse. And they clot off. And the shortness of breath lingers on...  on...  on. The doctor warned that such scarring would be a big issue for many who survive Covid.Everyoneaposs just so worried about the mortality thing and thataposs terrible and itaposs awful, she  told CBS Dallas-Fort Worth.But man, for all the survivors and the people who have tested positive this is — itaposs going to be a problem.  Dr Bankhead-Kendall reported that every patient who she had treated for Covid- had shown severe lung damage when X-rayed. Between  and  per cent of those who were asymptomatic had been similarly impacted. There are still people who say aposIaposm fine. I donapost have any issues,apos and you pull up their chest X-ray and they absolutely have a bad chest X-ray, she said. When it comes to those who spend days or even weeks struggling to breath on ventilators, it is not hard to imagine that their lungs would be heavily damaged as a result.  However, research into the impact seemingly mild cases of Covid- can have on lungs is only just beginning. A lot of people who were asymptomatic to begin with have found themselves struggling to breath in the months after they were infected.

She rushed him to hospital, where she received the devastating news her son had tested positive for Covid-. “Being completely honest, I immediately thought of death,’’ she said. “He was already fighting for his le, and then he gets Covid. My heart just dropped.” His infection delayed his eligibility to get a new liver for a month, and Ms Donerlson feared that he would miss any that became available. Thankfully his fever broke and his symptoms went away.  On January , she heard of a donor that would be a good match for her son. The family drove to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where Kasen underwent a nine hour surgery at UPMC Children’s Hospital.

Arkady Aksenov was riding on moving cargo carriages in Russia when he fell onto the track and his limbs were sliced off by the wheels. The boys he was with - aged  and  - ran away and “left him for dead”, but he miraculously survived. Arkadyaposs left leg was torn off completely, up to his buttock and he also lost his right leg but the cut was lower. The youngster was saved by passing train driver Bulat Zhakeev, who disobeyed rules to stop his engine, give first aid by preventing more blood loss, and summon emergency services. The boyaposs devastated mum Maria Petrova has gone public on the horror case to publicise the acute dangers from an escapade that has become popular. The yoga teacher’s furious and heartrending post on social media is addressed to the two boys she claims bullied her son to take part in the deadly activity in St Petersburg, and their parents. “Boys, you who study at the same school as Arkady and who have been pushing him to try train surfing and make a video for YouTube ‘to become famous’,” she wrote. “You who threatened him to get on that train. “There were two of you, aged  and , your names and addresses are of course established.”  The older boy is an “experienced” train surfer with his own YouTube Channel, it is claimed. She posted: “They left him wounded, bleeding. “They didn’t panic, but quietly left, through the bushes. “They didn’t try to run towards people so that they could have been seen by the accident place. “They were certain that there were no CCTV cameras on the railway, which is true, and that Arkady would die and not say a word.  “You little idiots! “If you were to call help, you would have been heroes. “Yes, people would have said that it was a pity you started it all, but they would have said well done to you not to have left your friend in that horrible hour. “You won’t be punished for what you’ve done. “By law, you won’t be punished because you are children and you are not subject to the law.  “Your parents won’t be punished either, because there is no clause in the Criminal Code which sends you to jail for being a bastard and for raising a bastard.” Maria attacked the parents of the boys, saying: “You didn’t even call me.” The mum-of-one is training to become a lawyer, she said. “Give it up, it’s obvious that you are a **** of a lawyer. On the other mother, she said: “I wish I could tell you to stop drinking.  “But I doubt you would ever be sober enough to read my advice.” She told them: “Live with it. “I wish that every night a bloodied boy without legs comes to your nightmares, stretching his arms towards you, and begging you to help. “His nails are broken off, his fingers are dirty because he was fighting the force of the train, holding himself on so that the train didn’t pull him under completely.” Maria has watched -minute footage of Arkady - a keen martial arts fighter before the tragedy - lying by the track in -C temperatures until the passing train driver stopped “to save my son’s le”.  The driver said: “I noticed a large dark spot from the corner of my eye, and thought it was soil not covered with snow, when suddenly it moved. “It was a person who somehow lted himself off the ground, and pushed away from the track.” He thought at first it was a homeless man who had sought to cross the tracks. But he said: “When I got closer, I realised it was a boy lying with his face down in the pool of his blood. “He said ‘Help. I’m cold’. “What I saw as dark soil was his blood. ‘To say I was shocked is to say nothing. This story needs to be heard as wide as possible. “Children simply don’t realise that a train even when it moves at slow speed creates a force that can pull them underneath.” The mother made the case public after watching her son on a ventilator for two weeks. “It is a miracle he survived for so long,” she said.  “I still cannot believe he remained sane after what happened to him. “I didn’t even know about train surfing before this happened. “The more I read about it now the more I feel mortied.” Detectives working on his case liken the illegal activity to sickening “so-called death groups” trying to push teens to suicide, she said. “I am going to fight this,” she vowed.

He knew he was going to do that before the ball came to him.“That was for me, apart from the execution, the great thing about that goal.“That is something I talk to the young players here about – you must have a plan before the ball comes to you.“That was a master class in how you should play the game.“There is a saying in football that average players react but great players anticipate.“A great player knows more quickly than anybody  what he is going to do.“The average player would have taken a touch then thought about what they were going to do.“He knew ages before it happened what was going to happen.#Mellon was caught up in the celebrations with his coaches and players and he now regrets was an instinctive reaction to a great piece of skill from Shankland.“There have been goals during my managerial career that have been very, very special but that certainly has to be right up there in terms of how close I was to it,” he added.“I was looking right down the barrel of it.“I had time to think: ‘If that goes in, that’s some goal.’ I then thought: ‘That’s got a chance.’“It hit the back of the net and I love football so that was a special moment.”As for the aftermath, he said: “It was just instinctive, wasn’t it “I broke every Covid rule and I apologise for that.“Football is a game that you love and you show your real emotions.“I’m not an actor. If I’m angry, you’ll see that I’m angry. If I’m excited you’ll see that I’m excited. If I’m sad you’ll see that I’m sad.“I find myself on the pitch and I tell myself: ‘Get off, you’re not a player anymore.’“It was a great moment but I have to apologise. I have to get better at that, maybe count to  then start reacting.“It is dficult because football is very instinctive.“It is hard to control your emotion and that is why players get booked for dissent.“But I understand what the government are saying – I get that.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures a look back at 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And that demands an emergency response.#Looking at solutions, Mr O#Hara pointed to Scotland’s climate change legislation, setting a target of  for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, while Argyll and Bute Council has a decarbonisation plan to reach this target including waste, energy, offsetting emissions and more.He ended on an optimistic note: #National low carbon investments may provide an opportunity for more balanced regional development within Scotland, including rural areas such as Argyll and Bute, helping to ersy our local economy.#Argyll and Bute, with all its natural beauty including valuable forests and peatlands, has an opportunity to take a lead in shaping what a net-zero Scotland could look like.#PICS:Brendan O#Hara MP with Kevin Campbell of BEAR Scotland at the Rest and be Thankful, following a major landslide in August . no_aRest_BrendanA major landslide in August  was followed by a second, pictured above, just weeks later. no_aRest_NewLandslide"},{"url":null,"title":"gaelic language survey goes live","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread - will help our essential efforts to suppress it.\"And however technical the changes may sound, I know that all of them involve further restrictions on our essential liberties.\"The decision comes as Covid cases across Scotland continue to stay at a high level, with the National Records of Scotland today revealing that , people have died with confirmed or suspectedcoronavirus.Heres what you need to know:TakeawaysThe First Minister has said thatfastfoodtakeaways, including many big-name chains, will face tighter restrictions as customers will no longer be permitted to go inside tocollect takeaway food or coffee.Any outlet wishing to offer takeaway will have to do so from a serving hatch or doorway.This reduces the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff.Alcohol changesAt the moment, dferent parts of Scotland have dferent laws in relation to the consumption of alcohol in outdoor public places.However, from Saturday, it will be against the law in all level  areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public.This will mean, for example, that buying a takeaway pint and drinking it outdoors will not be permitted.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I know this will not be a popular move.\"But it is intended to underline and support the fact that we should only be leaving home just now for essential purposes.\"That includes exercise or recreation but not simple socialising.\"And when you do leave the home, you should only meet one person from another household, in a group no bigger than two people.\"I know this is a hard message -

but stay at homeNo changes have been made for rules around outdoor exercise -however, Ms Sturgeon reiterated the \"stay at home\"regulations.The First Minister said: \"This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations.\"Right now, the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose.\"However, having left home for an essential purpose, someone could then stay out of their home to do something that is not essential without breaching the law as it stands.\"So the amendment will make it clear that people must not leave or remain outside the home unless it is for an essential purpose.\"This change will provide legal clarity to facilitate any necessary enforcement.Ms Sturgeon added: \"I want to be clear though that this does not change the range of essential purposes that currently enable people to leave their house - nor does it, for example, put any time limit on how long you can be outdoors for essential exercise.\"But it does mean thatthe police challenge you for being out of the house doing something that is not essential, it will not be a defence to say you initially left the house to do something that was essential.\"Click and Collect servicesShops that have been operating a Click and Collect service will have to stop doing so under the new guidelines.Now, only retailers selling essential items will be allowed to offer click and collect.This will include, for example, clothes and footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books.All other click and collect services must stop.The First Minister said: \"More importantly, for click and collect services that are allowed, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted.\"I know that businesses affected by this change will be disappointed and that many have gone to great s to make services as safe as possible.\"But we must reduce as far as is possible the reasons people have just now for leaving home and coming into contact with others.

They race out of their cars to help people load shopping into the boot, or help elderly people into the car, and often carry the heavy bags to customers# homes.Taxi drivers are a leline for elderly people all across the country and I hope ours know that we notice all the little things they do to go the extra mile.Name and address supplied.The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will, for the first time, intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory Government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

Some initial expressions of interest have been made and all options will be explored.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOThaw cuts water suppliesThe New Year thaw brought water shortages to much of Kintyre and the islands.Strathclyde Regional Council water workers, Argyll and Bute District Council housing maintenance teams, local plumbers and even the police were swamped with calls as pipes burst and water supplies were cut off.Many homes served by Aucha Lochy water treatment works near Campbeltown were cut off on New Year’s Day as the water pressure dropped due to burst pipes.The treatment plant was hit by a shutdown which has been blamed on a computer problem.As more burst pipes thawed out and started leaking, demand rose beyond the level which could be met by the treatment plant and its depleted storage tanks.As the amount of water available fell, so did the water pressure and homes on higher ground lost their supplies.Many parts of Southend were without water for  hours because there was not enough pressure in the pipes from Aucha Lochy to feed the pumping station at Auchencorvie.A water department spokesman said the high demand for water had mainly been caused by the amount wasted by burst pipes.FIFTY YEARS AGOLocal fan’s bus cancelled unexpectedly on eve of disaster matchThe Ne’erday clash between Glasgow soccer rivals Rangers and Celtic is normally attended by a bus-load of Campbeltown Rangers supporters.This year, however – for the first time since the local Rangers Supporters Association was founded in  – no bus travelled to the game.The secretary of the association, Mr Peter McKinley,  John Street, Campbeltown, explained that only  supporters showed any interest in the game – and the minimum number required to make the trip financially possible is .The bus was cancelled on the evening before the match.Mr McKinley told the Courier that he was relieved that the trip had not been possible.The exit at which  people were killed and hundreds injured at Ibrox Park on Saturday was the one always used by the Campbeltown contingent of supporters, he said.Mr McKinley is organising a dance and raffle in aid of the Ibrox disaster fund. Local beat group, the Sloe-Gin, will play at the dance without charge on Friday, January .Mr McKinley hopes to have the raffle on the way by the beginning of next week.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONew Year holiday attractionsThe entertainments arranged in town for the New Year holidays present attractions of an ample and ied description.Out of doors football holds the field, a series of interesting games have been arranged for both for New Year#s Day and the following Monday.The evenings can be pleasantly filled by a series of entertainments of great promise, while an exceptionally large exhibition of poultry, pigeons, cage birds and rabbits has been organised by the Campbeltown Ornithological Society.The local Picture House management have made very complete arrangements for the crowds who are sure to include in the holiday rounds a visit to ‘the pictures’.During Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, continuous shows will be given from  o#clock in the afternoon, doors opening at ..The principal picture for Saturday is entitled ‘In the Hollow of Her Hand’ and it will be supplemented by a number of other interesting films both topical and humorous.A change of picture will be made on Monday and again on Tuesday when the principal films will be ‘The Judgement of the Desert’ and ‘The Merry-Go-Round’ respectively.The latter will be continued on Wednesday, and will be followed on Thursday, Friday and Saturday with a striking film entitled ‘The Snares of Paris’.This ied programme will be welcomed by patrons and should result in sustained interest in shows at the Picture House during the holiday period.On New Year’s night, a concert will be given in the Victoria Hall under the auspices of the local branch of the Comrades of the Great War.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.”A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honours"},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

refuses to comply.Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations at Waitrose parent company, the John Lewis Partnership, said: ldquoBy insisting on the wearing of face coverings, over and above the social distancing measures we already have in place, we aim to make our shops even safer for customers.Aldi chief executive Giles Hurley also said: ldquoThe safety of our colleagues and customers is

responsibility to keep themselves and others safe.The renewed dedication to ensuring shoppers comply with government rules regarding face masks comes after supermarket staff revealed the abuse theyrsquove faced for challenging customers for not wearing a face covering.A Tesco worker from Gloucestershire said she was ldquohorried by responses she had received after challenging customers, adding: ldquoI find, and so do my colleagues, that itrsquos not as strict as the first lockdown.ldquoWe have people refusing to wear masks, customers not social distancing.ldquoI asked a customer where his mask was and he hit the roof, telling me [Covid-] is not real, and itrsquos the government making it all up - I was horried.An Asda staff member at a store in north-west Meryside added: ldquoI was put as a safety marshal on the front door, asking people to hand sanitise andthey need a mask.ldquoThe amount of times the response is lsquoOh, I canrsquot wear one of thosersquo, or lsquoIrsquom exemptrsquo, and show no proof.ldquoI used to ask people on the front door for proof of exemption and the abuse I got was mostly from the younger generation.ldquoMy manager told me we

Saturday,  January.The new guidance will include changes to takeaway services,click and collect, working from home, changes to alcohol laws, having work carried out in your home and the \"stay at home\" regulations.Nicola Sturgeon said: \"We believe that both inidually and collectively, these additional measures - in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread - will help our essential efforts to suppress it.\"And however technical the changes may sound, I know that all of them involve further restrictions on our essential liberties.\"The decision comes as Covid cases across Scotland continue to stay at a high level, with the National Records of Scotland today revealing that , people have died with confirmed or suspectedcoronavirus.The First Minister has said thatfastfoodtakeaways, including many big-name chains, will face tighter restrictions as customers will no longer be permitted to go inside tocollect takeaway food or coffee.Any outlet wishing to offer takeaway will have to do so from a serving hatch or doorway.This reduces the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff.At the moment, dferent parts of Scotland have dferent laws in relation to the consumption of alcohol in outdoor public places.However, from Saturday, it will be against the law in all level  areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public.This will mean, for example, that buying a takeaway pint and drinking it outdoors will not be permitted.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I know this will not be a popular move.\"But it is intended to underline and support the fact that we should only be leaving home just now for essential purposes.\"That includes exercise or recreation but not simple socialising.\"And when you do leave the home, you should only meet one person from another household, in a group no bigger than two people.\"I know this is a hard message - and it is not one I want to be sending - but it is vital to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.\"Credit: Colin MearnsThe Scottish Government intends to \"strengthen\" the obligation on employers to allow their staff to work from home wherever possible.The law already says that people should only be leaving home to go to workit is work that cannot be done from home.This is a legal obligation that falls on iniduals.However, Nicola Sturgeon announced that shewill now introduce statutory guidance to make clear to ensure that employers support employees to work from home wherever possible.For all employers, the basic message is thatyour staff were working from home during the first lockdown, they should be working from home now.Guidance from working inside peoples homes will now become law.Ms Sturgeon said: \"We have already issued guidance to the effect that in level  areas work is only permitted within a private dwellingit is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and ing of the household.\"No changes have been made for rules around outdoor exercise, however, Ms Sturgeon reiterated the \"stay at home\"regulations.The First Minister said: \"This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations.\"Right now, the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose.\"However, having left home for an essential purpose, someone could then stay out of their home to do something that is not essential without breaching the law as it stands.\"So the amendment will make it clear that people must not leave or remain outside the home unless it is for an essential purpose.\"This change will provide legal clarity to facilitate any necessary enforcement.Ms Sturgeon added: \"I want to be clear though that this does not change the range of essential purposes that currently enable people to leave their house - nor does it, for example, put any time limit on how long you can be outdoors for essential exercise.\"But it does mean thatthe police challenge you for being out of the house doing something that is not essential, it will not be a defence to say you initially left the house to do something that was essential.\"Shops that have been operating a Click and Collect service will have to stop doing so under the new guidelines.Now, only retailers selling essential items will be allowed to offer click and collect.This will include, for example, clothes and footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books.All other click and collect services must stop.The First Minister said: \"More importantly, for click and collect services that are allowed, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted.\"I know that businesses affected by this change will be disappointed and that many have gone to great s to make services as safe as possible.\"But we must reduce as far as is possible the reasons people have just now for leaving home and coming into contact with others.

But this adversity will create opportunity, rebuilding and rethinking the way we do business and how we support our communities.While calls to focus on the social aspects of the economy have become more insistent in recent years, Covid- has fuelled their urgency. Our norms have been questioned and there is a real desire for change. Business leaders have prioritised wellbeing, communities have responded by supporting each other through the crisis, and new and innovative ways of being economically viable have come to the fore.Research by Co-operatives UK showed community ownership models are helping to create a new generation of UK businesses that are better equipped to withstand the Covid- crisis, or any economic crisis of this scale. Focusing on community shares, a way of funding community co-operatives, the study finds that of those businesses who have raised finance this way, a remarkable % are still trading.Since , pound million has been raised by more than , community share investors across the UK to save and create more than  vital community spaces and businesses.Community co-operatives are run by and for their community, with profits generated invested back into those communities. They can have a signicant positive impact whether they provide a service, deliver economic growth, or contribute towards the health and wellbeing of the local community.The model is particularly suited to Scotlandrsquos economy due to the prevalence of rural communities. Sectors including retail, hospitality and tourism can be the main employer in rural locations, particularly for young people, playing a key role in safeguarding jobs and retaining young residents. Businesses within these sectors can be run as community co-operatives allowing the communities, sometimes overlooked by traditional businesses, to create new jobs while protecting vital services or developing exciting new opportunities.During the initial response to the pandemic many of these businesses had a greater understanding of their communitiesrsquo needs, helping them to adapt and innovate during the crisis and putting them in a strong position to not only weather the economic storm but to thrive.The Community Carrot, a community-run shop in Dunbar, East Lothian, went from supplying  vegetable boxes per week before the pandemic to  during the first lockdown. Strong and well-established local supply chains with mills and farms, something local chain shops didnrsquot have, meant all orders were fulfilled and deliveries to vulnerable customers were guaranteed. The Community Carrot has signicantly grown its customer base on the back of the reliable and reassuring service it is able to provide during dficult times.The economic and social potential of community co-operatives is signicant and should be more widely adopted in Scotland. Combined with the greater community spirit that has been cultivated during Covid-, now is the right time to champion community co-operatives that can sustain jobs and communities and deliver wider economic, social and environmental benefits.Clare Alexander is Head of Co-operative Development Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-surely-unsung-supermarket-heroes-bumped-list-vaccination","story":"Being on the retail front line during the pandemic cannot be much fun. Shortly before Christmas a weary-looking assistant in Tesco told me that he gets regular abuse from customers. ldquoYou wouldnrsquot believe it, he said. Before reaching me, he had been serving a woman who appeared to be anticipating Armageddon rather than lockdown. Her elderly companion in a mobility scooter was helping her to pack, setting each item as carefully into the bags asit were a Ming vase. Despite the queue building up, the till assistant was a model of patience and cheer, and the feel-good effect rippled down the line, putting everyone in a better mood.As customers grow lax about safety, and shops grow overcrowded, staff are starting to protest against the daily health risks they are obliged to run. With people abandoning masks, refusing to sanitise and licking their fingers before counting out money, you understand why they might be anxious. :Country Le with Rosemary Goring: Snow brings cold comforts Stores are among the riskiest places you can be, in terms of catching Covid. Before the virus had begun spreading as fast as it presently is, a study in England last November showed almost a fth of infections were linked to a shopping trip.With the new iant now galloping across the British Isles, it is sobering to reflect that every outing for groceries is like running a gauntlet. Whether you emerge unscathed depends on factors completely out of your hands ndash namely, other people. Most of us are now schooled in donning a mask, wiping trolleys and sanitising our hands on entering, but once over the door, the threat multiplies.: Country Le with Rosemary Goring: Snow brings cold comfortsSome remain oblivious to social distancing, seeming determined to encroach on your patch. Filthy looks over the rim of a mask make no impression whatsoever. What can you do but step back  Yet while I try to stick to the rules, occasionally I struggle with one-way systems, and find myself backtracking at speed. Taking a wrong turning and discovering yoursquore going against the flow reminds me of the day when, oblivious to a no-entry sign, I drove down an Edinburgh street to find a tram heading straight for me.In shops, the people Irsquove seen who donrsquot follow the prescribed route around the aisles are not usually deliberately breaching the code or ignoring the signage, but are elderly and a little bewildered. Being vintage does not, of course, mean you cannot be carrying the virus, but such slip-ups do not inspire the same outrage as the aggressive attitude of wilful rebels. In this category I include folk taking children around the store, asthey were on a trip to a theme park.Recent announcements by Morrisons and Sainsburyrsquos that they will bar anyone not wearing a face covering, without proof of medical exemption, have been swtly followed by Asda, Tesco and Waitrose. This is to be welcomed, above all by their staff. It is one thing for most of us to do a swt weekly raid for essentials, quite another to be in contact with the public for hours on end. Nor should shop workers have to act as law enforcers.:From a winter wonderland to an ice-bound hell In light of the Selkirkincident, itrsquos understandable why someone would hesitate to confront a customer without a mask, or urge them to keep a distance. Some shops say they tell staff not to challenge those who wonrsquot wear face coverings, since it might be for valid medical reasons. Presumably they also donrsquot want them to run any risk of verbal or physical abuse. Sadly, that is little comfort for shoppers in their vicinity, and even less for the checkout operative who, despite screens, masks, visors and gloves, has no alternative but to be uncomfortably close to them for as long as it takes to ring through their goods. Since supermarkets have done well during this crisis ndash and eventhey had not ndash they should have trained security personnel at every branch, to enforce the rules.Given the level of contact shop staff have with the public, should they be prioritised for vaccinations  All who fall into the higher risk categories, whether by age or medical vulnerability, will already be among the first to receive it. But what about the rest  If staff in care homes and the NHS are getting the jab, should not supermarket workers too  Thatrsquos certainly the argument of Usdaw, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, whose concerns on this front have been heightened by the recent deaths from Covid  of two staff from Tesco in Greenock. Usdaw is also urging ato the stricter protocols of the original lockdown in March, when, among other measures, the numbers of customers was closely monitored.In an ideal world, shop workers would be protected ahead of those who can continue to work from home or in isolation until the pandemic is under control. Realistically, in the current race to deploy supplies of vaccine most effectively, I donrsquot see them being bumped up the queue. Defining who would be eligible would be a mammoth task in itself.Nevertheless, therersquos no doubt that supermarket staff should be recognised in the same breath as those who work in the NHS. Ask someone what they do, andthe answer is a nurse or doctor, peoplersquos faces tend to light up. If they say they work in Asda, the response tends not to be so enthusiastic. Yet it should. They might not be dealing with patients in intensive care, but now, more than ever, the shelf stackers, online order processors, delivery drivers and those at the tills deserve utmost respect and admiration. Without them, the cogs of our lives would cease to turn within a matter of days, and where would that leave us "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-covid-waste-vital-vaccine","story":"It states categorically that I should receive the vaccination evenI have had the virus, as ldquoevenyou have already had Covid- you could still get it again. The vaccine will reduce your risk of getting Covid-. If you do get it again, the vaccine can reduce how serious the symptoms will be.I had the virus in late November. Although I am old , I was fortunate in not suffering unduly. A couple of days feeling ldquounder the weather and food delivered to the door and so on sufficed.But according to information I have looked out, some highly respectable research indicates that I will have acquired an immunity that should last around six months. Furthermore that immunity includes the inability to spread the virus to others, which the vaccination does not. Therefore NHS Scotland, the Scottish Government and Public Health Scotland are colluding in sending out information that is not strictly  but is not strictly accurate either. Yes, I could get it again, but it is highly unlikely within six months, by which time it seems that the effect of the vaccination might have worn off anyhow.I can understand why they would want to send out that message, as the alternative complicates the management of the administration of the vaccine. Easier by far to just jab us all in order.However, according to the figures I looked up today, , people have had and recovered from Covid-. That is potentially , wasted vaccinations. And no one has attempted to clary what is the impact of either of the vaccines on natural immunity.This raises some interesting questions ndash like could the natural immunity provided by Covid- infection take the place of the first injection, and simply be boosted by the second In any case I would much prefer teachers to be given priority for vaccination and let the kids get back some sort of le ndash, vaccines would go some way toward that.Clare Darlaston, Glasgow G.WHEN DO WE GET TO CHOOSE AS the vaccines are rolled out, the death and hospitalisation rates for Covid- will decrease. Despite what the Scottish and UK governments say about statistics not changing until end of March, we will soon see a decrease in these awful numbers. For example, in two to three weeks time, the . million people already vaccinated will be immune. The fundamental issue is who underwrites the risk when the infection rate decreases In the UK, there are , deaths from heart disease each year, and , serious or fatal car accidents, yet inidual rather than state responsibility prevails on preventative measures. What gives the Government the right to endlessly control peoples lives with draconian restrictions, when the risk from Covid- reduces to an acceptable level  I submit that in a free and democratic society, when the risk to society in general becomes less than the risk to the inidual, citizens should have the right to control their own destiny rather than submitting to long-lasting, however well-intentioned, state intervention.Dr Ian Forbes, Glasgow GCONCENTRATE ON THE ROLL-OUTWITH its usual alacrity the Scottish Government has managed to make us just that bit more miserable by its toughening and likely extension of the current lockdown. It may be necessary but that doesnt make it any less depressing.Meanwhile, its distribution of the vaccine seems to be progressing with all the speed and urgency of a somewhat arthritic snail.Would it perhaps be too much to ask that it now concentrates on spending as much,not more, effort and time in rolling out its best hope of restoring our freedoms as it seems to do on the process of removing them Dave Henderson, Glasgow G.THANKS FOR STERLING SERVICETODAYI took my dad to his local village hall for his Covid- vaccination.

I wish to thank not only the young lady who gave me the jab most professionally, but also the assistants, many of them volunteers, who carried out their duties efficiently and with good humour towards the many oldies who were piling in at their allotted timeIt was not as slick as the flu jag, due to the question and answer session required for each patient however, whats a few minutes between friends  So thanks again to all concerned, not forgetting the office staff behind the scenes who set it all up.Jim Eddie, Dunblane.GET SHOPS BACK INTO LINEI AM pleased to note that at long last supermarkets have recognised that they are not as robust as they were with their Covid social distancing practices .Back in spring summer you queued to get in and were counted in and out at the front door, thus managing numbers in stores. My we is a merchandiser who has to go into supermarkets and maintain and replenish stock and has commented many times recently on how much busier the stores are and on the free-for-all in supermarkets where some folk appear to be treating store visits as a three-generation family outing and letting children treat stores as play areas.When she and the store workers are trying to rearrange and replenish stock the phrase ldquoexcuse me is noticeably absent as customers barge into you to get what they want with no thoughts of social distancing whatsoever. Hopefully the new restrictions will help those working in stores to stay safe and reduce possible spread of infections.I often wonder, though: is the definition of ldquoessential goods needing redefined so that some areas of large stores should be closed off  I was recently in a large clothing food store where clothes on the same level as food were for sale but for some strange reason clothes on the upper level were blocked off yet stores selling clothing only are closed. Why Surelya store is open for food and has to restrict upper floor access the same products on lower floors should also be restricted.Dougie Jardine, Bishopbriggs.HELP TEACHERS WHO ARE IN SCHOOLROSEMARY Goring is absolutely correct. Her views can apply also to a further vital group apparently forgotten.Two members of my family are teaching children of frontline workers. If they and others like them did not turn up to educate these children, their parents could no longer work and valuable services, essential to our well-being in the battle against Covid, would cease.Why are these hard-working teachers, in particular as they are in continually open schools, not on any priority vaccination list Patricia Dewar Gibb, Glasgow G.THINK TANK FIGURES DONT ADD UPTHE claim from Gordon Browns think tank Our Scottish Future that Scotlandrsquos Covid- test and protect system is failingis highly questionable. It is certainly not supported by the statistical analyses it published.To assess the performance of the system, you would need to estimate the numbers of infections prevented by isolating infected cases and their close contacts, whether positive or not. This is not what the published estimates purport to do. Instead, they base their calculations on a simplistic assessment of the proportion of prevalent infections identied by tests. This tells us precisely nothing about infections prevented.In fact, the published estimates ndash % for Scotland ndash do not even correctly identy the proportions of infections identied by testing. To obtain these figures, the authors of the report cumulate tests over  days, when in fact the average duration of a Covid- infection is closer to  days, as indicated by ONS incidence and prevalence estimates. This alone produces a large underestimate.However, the underpinning methodology is more fundamentally flawed, as demonstrated by the reportrsquos data for Northern Ireland, which indicates that on some days there were more positive tests than infections. Something is seriously wrong here, and itrsquos most likely not with Scotlandrsquos test and protect system.Paddy Farrington, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at the Open University, Edinburgh EH.Read more: NHS Lothian drops policy blamed for slowing down care home vaccinations"},{"url":null,"title":"government-newspaper-columnist-really-good-idea","story":"But the thing that keeps me awake at night the most is the fear that people might now think I actually know what Irsquom talking about.More than that, I worry that I might start thinking I know what Irsquom talking about.

Well, with yet more restrictions in place, an unnecessary risk averse approach, and painfully slow mass vaccination roll out programme lacking in ambition, no credible exit strategy and detailed roadmap to recovery yet published, and no guarantees of government bail outs after April, it looks like this beacon of hope has been blown out.

Citizens assemblies in other countries have addressed one specic issue they could influence, for example abortion in Ireland, fully understanding the issue and implications.The post-war generation in Scotland expected to work hard for what they wanted but successive Scottish governments, no matter their political background, have sought to bribe the population with freebies in order to stay in power, with no tax implications for the vast majority.

Ordinary people must have the opportunity to make their opinions known, to make sure that policy makers take the lives and experiences of citizens into consideration when putting anything into law. For example, I believe that tax haven loopholes must be closed. I believe that we should have a second governing chamber which is elected.It is the responsibility of our elected representatives to govern for the benefit of every citizen, not just the rich and powerful.The people who take part in Citizens Assemblies should be given expenses to cover any loss they might experience I do not believe they should be paid a salary. But I totally disagree with Mr Simpson when he says \"the majority of us have no real interest\" in influencing what goes on in the Scottish Parliament. There are millions of activists in this country, of which I am one, who are sick and tired of the rich and powerful trashing our society.

Itrsquos a ruse he used to avoid answering the question about why Brexit has been a disaster for many fishermen on Scotlandrsquos West Coast.The First Minister displays her concern about the pandemic at almost each daily briefing. Polls show that, by a signicant margin, she is the most trusted political leader in the UK, and I doubt that a fair-minded person would question her sincerity. Unionist criticism of the running of an election in May is more to do with their concern about the result than the timing itself. Many elections across the world have gone ahead during the pandemic. The Conservatives were happy to try to negotiate the removal of the UK from the EU, including refusing to extend the transition period beyond , while the Covid- virus has been rampaging.To say that Scotlandrsquos economy would struggle without the assistance of the Barnett Formula is a self-evident truth, as we do not have full economic levers.

To see what not accepting the result of a democratic vote looks like, we need only look at the United States and the reaction of Donald Trump and his followers to the result of the Presidential election. The SNP did not suggest that the vote was rigged, its leaders did not say that they had won, they did not march to Holyrood as an armed mob demanding that MSPs reverse the result.

Then what Without any credible and robust exit strategy, something all UK governments have continually failed to deliver since the beginning of this pandemic, then any roadmap to recovery is going to be littered with cavernous potholes, which will have disastrous consequences. Not least for Scotlandrsquos live music industry. A vital sector that, at the last count, generated a staggering pound million in spending, sustaining around  full time jobs, which is now worth the inside of a polo mint. Not to mention, the tens of thousands of people and small businesses that are reliant on its essential but very fragile supply chain.:Glasgow festivals prepare for virtual events amid lockdown restrictionsMark Mackie, of Regular Music, promoters of Castle Concerts and Kelvingrove Bandstand Summer Nights, didnrsquot mince his words when he said: ldquoThe wonderful scientists of the world have done the hard bit. Now we need the politicians to do theirs and get the roll out done as quickly as possible, losing another summer would wreak absolute devastation on the live music industry.Geoff Ellis, DF Concerts supremo, promoters of TRNSMT and Bellahouston Park, to name but a few, echoed that sentiment. He said: ldquoIf we look back to Glasgow in , the fledgling NHS was able to vaccinate  people per hour per clinic against smallpox. Hopefully vaccine production will speed up and we could see the roll out accelerate.John Richardson, co-head of Linlithgowrsquos hugely popular Party at the Palace Festival, adds: ldquoMonths of planning go into putting on a music festival and for many, the new deadline is approaching at an alarming rate. Bands need booked, hotels, travel, stages, sound and lighting, first aid, security etc.In December we were assured by the FM that with the vaccine there was now a light at the end of tunnel. Well, with yet more restrictions in place, an unnecessary risk averse approach, and painfully slow mass vaccination roll out programme lacking in ambition, no credible exit strategy and detailed roadmap to recovery yet published, and no guarantees of government bail outs after April, it looks like this beacon of hope has been blown out. And with it any chance of a normality ing by this summer. The sound of silence and despair looks set to continue."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12228842.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-new-ways-enjoy-burns-night-home","story":"The GlenlivetThe Glenlivet is committed to brightening up Alternate Burns Night celebrations, inviting you to introduce a new flair to the proceedings and think outside the box with original twists on not just the traditional Burns Supper but the good auld Scotch drink itself that accompanies it.At The Glenlivet, they always uphold the importance of their own heritage as a brand and their place in Scottish history and whisky production.

He asked Ms Forbes to clary whether or not island councils will be free to use the top up funding to support any businesses, including accommodation providers, to provide parity with support available in the rest of the country.In response, Ms Forbes confirmed that the #top up# announced by the First Minister would ensure businesses in island communities receive the same support, on the same level, as those in Level Four areas.Afterwards, Mr McArthur said: “While the announcement earlier this week of a ‘top up’ fund for island authorities was welcome, it soon became apparent that many businesses, including accommodation providers, were at risk of being excluded.“That was unacceptable and out of step with the assurances I received from the Finance Secretary last week. I’m pleased Kate Forbes has now set the record straight in a response to me at Finance Questions by confirming that island businesses will have access to the same ongoing funding as those in Level Four areas.“This support may be delivered through a Discretionary Fund rather than the Strategic Framework Business Fund, but Ms Forbes could not have been clearer that the effect should be the same.“Hopefully, Orkney Islands Council is now able to put a process in place to allow businesses to begin applying for the support they so desperately need.#He added: “The Finance Secretary also helpfully claried that the ‘top up’ support is over and above what can be accessed through the sector-specic funds, announced at the end of last year.“Details for most of the sector specic funds have not yet been published, but are expected later this month. Ms Forbes insisted that these are open to businesses across Scotland, including the islands”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes on top of £m already committed for education recovery since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total additional support provided to more than £ million since the start of the pandemic.#I appreciate only too well the additional burden home learning is placing on many of our children and their families,# Mr Swinney said.#After the last period of school building closures we commissioned an Equity Audit, published today, to better understand the impact on children’s learning and health and wellbeing, particularly disadvantaged pupils.“Since the start of the pandemic our funding has led to an additional , teachers and over  support staff being appointed. The new funding can be used to recruit further staff # which might include teachers, classroom assistants, administrative staff, home school link workers or other support workers — as well as the resources that families and schools need to support home learning, including additional digital devices where there is any remaining unmet need, and other home learning resources.#Mr Swinney has also asked HM Inspectors of Education to commence with a national review of the quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country with the first report published next Friday, January .He said: “The quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country will be reviewed by HM Inspectors of Education. A programme of ‘national overviews’, will commence immediately and last for the duration of remote learning.##These will seek to identy what is working well and where further improvement is required. These overviews will be published weekly to ensure they are available for everyone to learn and build from, starting week ending  January.#Private and third sector day care of children settings are also set to receive almost £ million in temporary financial support.The education secretary added: “I am aware that remaining open for very small numbers of children creates pressure for some childcare providers, and I can therefore confirm we will make temporary financial support of up to £. million available for each four week period of restrictions to day care of children providers and childminding settings caring for  or more children who remain open for vulnerable and keyworker children during these restrictions.#We will confirm details as soon as possible.“If the evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that, and we will ensure the package of mitigations in schools remains robust and tailored to the circumstances we face. As part of that work, we expect that pilots of two dferent testing models – one using in-school testing with Lateral Flow Devices, and another involving at-home testing using PCR tests – will begin in a small number of schools from next week, helping to inform options for wider rollout.“I am grateful to our hardworking, dedicated teaching professionals for their intense work to plan, organise and deliver learning.

The government defines these within three categories, with priority for those directly involved in supporting the response to Covid, including health, care, and emergency or critical provision.“However, the third category is more loosely defined, and it may be that parents are applying for their child to attend school without exploring all other childcare options.“At the moment, the safest place for children is at home.The government has told us that we need to keep the numbers in school to an absolute minimum, to prevent transmission of infection.“I’d ask parents to consider whether the need for their child to attend school is critical – whether, for example, permitted informal childcare would be available – and for employers to do all they can to support their staff to work from home wherever possible.”..Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie

have a huge store of personal Protective Equipment for the health care sector or anyone  who requires it.“This time it has been a lot easier than the first time, we were reacting to the situation then and learning as we went along, but now we are well prepared.“We are here, we have the phone line, it#s open five days a week but we can scale it up to seven days a weekneeded.”He added: “We have a great bunch of people on board and we connect with all the other operations throughout the island.”A number of food share and emergency food provision initiatives are in operation throughout the island and are advertised locally —you need further advice you can call the helpline.Prior to Christmas Skye Community Response volunteers provided  festive hampers and  presents to members of the community mainly around the Portree and Braes area but also island-wide for Women’s Aid.“Nobody should hesitate in getting touch, the food shares are there to be used, and we are here to help.“We have a robust set-up, and we can also direct people to the relevant support in their area.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/LOCKDOWN-LITTERPICK-3.jpg","title":"litter pickers aiming to make a clean sweep across","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye Lockdown Litterpick was set up to encourage people to clean up their local area during the tier  lockdown from Christmas into the New Year, and to date more than  people have become members of the Facebook group.With the conditions of lockdown now tightened until at least the end of January, Dunvegan resident Jennie Chapman, who set up the group, believes that the virtual community of litter pickers is empowering people on Skye to do their bit inidually for a collective cause.: “The Facebook group provides a virtual community where anyone living on Skye can get involved in picking up litter in their local area during this — now extended — lockdown period.“We will then collate all the information about quantities collected and map the areas covered so that we can see an ever growing picture of community involvement in making the island cleaner.“You will see, on the page announcements, a map that is updated every couple of days at least.” Commenting on the response to the group, she said: “At the time of writing there are  members of the group.“Many of these are people who I am sure have been concerned about this issue for some time and may well have already been regularly picking up litter on walks.“However, it can feel like a bit of an uphill battle when you do it on your own so this virtual community is so encouraging when you begin to see how many others care and are also wanting to do their part.”Highlighting the scope of the problem, she added: “We are certainly finding that across the island some of the worst spots for littering include along road verges, especially on the larger roads, around parking areas and lay bys and in popular walking spots.“The range of things that we are collecting includes absolutely huge numbers of drinks bottles, cans, coffee cups and snack wrappers — especially those thrown from car windows along verges — and random items such as huge builders bags, car exhaust pipes and even dirty nappies and used condoms.”Addressing the tightened restrictions now in place, Jennie said: “Everyone taking part is doing so either on their own or in accordance with all now further tightened legal requirements for meeting outside — so from now that will be only with one other person at most and remaining at full social distance.“We have found that two people working to collect from either side of a road verge works well.“All collections are then reported into the group on Facebook for mapping.“At the time of writing we have so far logged  large bin bags full of rubbish being removed from  dferent locations around the island as well as at least  large objects – and we have at least all of January to go!“You will see from the map that the project has now spread to all four corners of the island.”While Jennie acknowledges that the group itself is not a stand-alone solution to the issue, she does hope that it might have a positive effect and persuade people to think twice about littering.She said: “Although this is a short-term project the longer-term issue is unlikely to go away anytime soon so we hope that at least the project raises awareness of the issue.“And maybe it will encourage some people to take their rubbish home rather than littering the countryside and encourages everyone who takes part in trying to keep their local area clean.“There are lots of us out there and we are all part of a bigger picture.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3584276.jpg--.jpg?1610715452000\n","title":"chief medical officers urge everyone to stay home","story":"Chief

This is having a signicant impact on the health of our population and the safe ing of our healthcare systems.“Unfortunately, due to the surge of infections we have experienced over the past few weeks, we have seen an increase in mortality figures and our health systems have been placed under immense pressure.

COVID- can affect us all, regardless of age or underlying condition. It highlights the need for us all to protect one another by staying at home.

However, people from the RoI Revenue are saying something dferent at the moment.We are trying to work it out as we speak. Earlier this week local dealers learned with relief that they will avoid having to pay % Vat on the value of used vehicles imported from Britain under the Brexit protocol.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the Government would instead reinstate Vat on profits, saving dealers thousands of pounds.Cars bought new here, then sold second-hand in the Republic, will face Vehicle Registration Taxand NOx emission costs already in place, but nothing extra.However,a dealer from the Republic travels to Britain, buys a car second-hand and brings it back, a % tarf and % customs fee will be added to the cost.The potential advantage for local used car dealers over those based in the rest of the UK is clearthey can sell cars on in the Republic.Dealers are trying to clary whether they are able to buy in Britain, bring the vehicle over, then sell across the border without incurring the extra cost.There is a brisk trade between Britain and the Republic, but that is going to be disrupted, said Mr Hetherington.For buyers of used cars in the south, the net effect will be higher prices and less choice in used cars as a current source of supply is being cut off, he added.Representatives were told by the Republic#s Revenue officials that it is all based on rules of origin - thatthe vehicle is manufactured in, or has passed through Britain, then it will be subject to the increased cost, Mr Hetherington said.But the Withdrawal Agreement wording suggests to him we can bring them through Northern Ireland without facing tarfs and customs costs.He added there is the possibility the Republic#s tax collectors could face a legal challengethey do impose the charges.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy has welcomed confirmation that used cars imported from Britain and sold to businesses and consumers here will not incur the higher Vat charges.This additional % would have crippled many businesses in the North, resulted in the loss of jobs and resulted in families paying extra money for cars, the Mid Ulster MP said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already welcomed the move, saying the protocol was on the verge of destroying practically every second-hand car business in Northern Ireland.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland produce can feed  million, Poots told after his #no food# warningsNorthern Ireland produces enough to feed its entire population five times over, a supplier has said after a Stormont minister claimed hospitals and schools faced the prospect of being unable to feed patients and children.Northern IrelandUncertainty for NI#s steel industry as #surprise# % tarf to be imposed on non-GB importsThe steel sector in Northern Ireland is confused and uncertain after it emerged a surprise % tarf will be imposed on imports not from Great Britain.Most ReadPolice believe blaze at Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building was deliberate hate crime Coronavirus: Northern Ireland records highest daily number of deaths as CMOs in cross border stay-at-home pleaWe have given blood for Union: Paisley launches scathing attack on Boris Johnson over post-Brexit supply issuesWitness to assault that resulted in death of Darren O#Neill at Tyrella beach breaks down giving evidence Girlwith autism left traumatised after #explosive-type devices# thrown at Armagh homesLatest BrexitWe have given blood for Union: Paisley launches scathing attack on Boris Johnson over post-Brexit supply issuesUncertainty for NI#s steel industry as #surprise# % tarf to be imposed on non-GB importsNorthern Ireland produce can feed  million, Poots told after his #no food# warningsProtocol promise: PM in vow to trigger Article trading dficulties worsenLatest from Belfast Dillian Whyte’s rematch against Alexander Povetkin scheduled for March Large retailers urged to stop selling non-essential goodsUK scraps travel corridors to protect against new strains of coronavirusCoronavirus hospital admissions set to peak in next  days, Whitty saysMauricio Pochettino to self-isolate after positive Covid- test,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s a while ago now, but, as a student of English, one of the books we all had to study was Animal Farm.And one line has always stood out - All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.It#s a phrase that has been transferred to so many walks of le since George Orwell penned it on August , .The transfer test, the old -plus exam, was born just two years later. It stood the test of time, until time caught up.Of course no one wants to limit any parent#s choice in what school to send their child to. But are parents the best people to choose  We all fall into the mode of pushing our children to be the best that they can be and there#s nothing wrong with that.Time has allowed those using the system to work the system, find shortcuts, workarounds, make the system work for them.The academic selection of children aged - has had a business built around it.For a business to work, you need capital funds. Not everyone has those funds.You wonder just how many children went to a dferent school because someone , who might not have started out as academically proficient, overtook them through intense, specialised tutoring, paid for by parents who could afford it, taught by former teachers who knew the tricks of the trade.And there emerged a new breed of parents.In counselling terms, they are referred to as #helicopter parents#. They hover over their child#s every move, dissect work in microscopic details.Ask any counsellor working in the school environment and they will tell you the pressure to succeed has never been greater, and it is having a detrimental effect on the mental health of so many pupils. They are left with little room to breathe, strangled by these new #Tiger parents# - a phrase coined in  in a Yale University study of academic achievement, using all means possible to ensure the future success of a child.Earlier this week, before AQE finally pulled out of holding a single transfer test, Stranmillis University published research into the inequalities of the education system. These are the educators, turning the spotlight on the profession they have excelled in. They warned of the widening #lockdown learning gap#. Those who have, swim, those who haven#t start to drown. The educational waters have been stirred and the ship is listing.I#m reminded of another book, Robinson Crusoe. Shipwrecked on a desert island he had to learn a new way of living. Time is fast approaching where the whole education system needs a similar restructuring.There will always be a place for grammar schools. Some pupils naturally thrive in that environment, but they should not be pushed into it aged . It has to be the right thing for them, not for their social status in adulthood. Teachers should know the academic merits of their pupils. Intensive tutoring for a transfer test shouldn#t bypass that. With the AQE washing hands of any involvement in the transfer of pupils this year, it#s been left up to the schools themselves to chart a course through the waves. There are many rocks lurking under the surface, no less in the form of legalities.All post-primaries were to submit their admissions criteria to the Education Authority by today but following the AQE#s move that has been extended until Friday, January .It is not a lot of time to get things right, close all exploitable loopholes and take a steamroller to level that playing field cut up further by a turbulent winter - which is why this process should have been planned for before we got to this stage.And though the utopia of #all schools are equal# may never be reached, surely now is the window of opportunity to make sure that all schools are a little less more equal than others Belfast Related ContentGalleryEducationPeter Weir#s #clumsy# tweet slammed by heads of NI secondary schoolsSecondary school principals in Northern Ireland have slammed the Education Minister for implying they provide a second class option for pupils.Education PremiumTim CairnsOpinionExecutive didn#t have courage to lead and have failed the class of Everyone in Northern Ireland has a transfer test story to share.

There were  countries, islands and territories on Northern Ireland#s travel corridor list, allowing visitors to travel to the region without having to self-isolate.The Department of Health has said that regulations and an amended list of exemptions is currently being developed and will be published over the weekend. el.async  trueel.src  https:belfasttelegraph.bbvms p twocol_article c .js dart_art_IDdart_articleIddart_kw%B%International%%C%travellers%%C%must%%C%isolate%%C%on%%C%arrival%%C%in%%C%NI%%C%as%%C%travel%%C%corridor%%C%scrapped%%Ddart_gs_channelsgs_notprocesseddart_sectionnews_health_coronavirusdfp_adunit_lbelfasttelegraphdfp_adunit_lNewsdfp_adunit_lHealthdfp_adunit_lCoronavirusdocument.getElementByIdChildNorthern Ireland#s Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said that decisions around travel corridors were based on assessing the public health risk from SARS-COV- and not new strains.He explained that given the risk posed by new strains of the virus travel corridors could not continue in the same way.It is not possible to predict with any certainty the risk that a particular country or region will be the originator of a iant of concern, Dr McBride said. “This move is designed to provide time within which to reassess the position on international travel and develop a system better able to respond to the risk of new iants, this work will be done in collaboration with the Scottish Government and Welsh Government.”The Executive is also working with the UK Government to facilitate urgent conversations with the Irish Government to improve data sharing from Dublin, to minimise the risk of a back door emerging through the land border.At Thursday#s Executive Covid- briefing First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill were critical of the Irish Government over their failure to share information from passenger locator forms.Belfast Most ReadPolice believe blaze at Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building was deliberate hate crime Coronavirus: Northern Ireland records highest daily number of deaths as CMOs in cross border stay-at-home pleaWe have given blood for Union: Paisley launches scathing attack on Boris Johnson over post-Brexit supply issuesWitness to assault that resulted in death of Darren O#Neill at Tyrella beach breaks down giving evidence Girlwith autism left traumatised after #explosive-type devices# thrown at Armagh homesLatest CoronavirusTwo children test positive for Covid- in Woodlands Juvenile Justice CentreMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaSupreme Court insurance claim ruling #welcome relief# for small businesses, says Hospitality UlsterCoronavirus: Translink reduces cross-border Enterprise train servicesLatest from Belfast Dillian Whyte’s rematch against Alexander Povetkin scheduled for March Large retailers urged to stop selling non-essential goodsUK scraps travel corridors to protect against new strains of coronavirusCoronavirus hospital admissions set to peak in next  days, Whitty saysMauricio Pochettino to self-isolate after positive Covid- test,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Happy birthday mum.”So lucky to be in this position â¤ï¸ Happy birthday mum 🎉🚗 pic AiRrYYcV— Adam BJanuary , Adam, who has more than three million subscribers to his YouTube channel, landed a presenter’s post with Blue Peter last year.Purchasing his mum a new car is the not the first time Adam has shared expensive gts.In December, he surprised -year-old Stewart O’Doherty after finding out he was being bullied in school.After reading a tweet from Stewart’s sister Molly about his ordeal, Adam bought Stewart £, worth of birthday gts to help him in his YouTube career.It was a moment caught on video which the internet star plans to use as part of an anti-bullying campaign.Stewart was stunned when Adam turned up at his Londonderry home with a laptop, cameras, microphones, speakers, GoPros and numerous other gadgets to help him start out.Talking about his own and Stewart#s experience of bullying he said at the time: Stewart should be proud of himself for doing something dferent and escaping that #small town# mentality of being ridiculed for doing something dferent.It angers me so much that bullying is still happening. I started doing YouTube in  periodically until  when I devoted a lot of my time to it.Being in an all-boy school, back when there were no big Northern Irish YouTubers to look up to - it was very dficult to stay on that path.It was dficult to keep believing when everyone  was slagging you off, making fun, calling you names as you walked past them in school corridors. It was horrible and I wish it on no one.Stewart#s case hit a nerve. I know exactly what he is going through. Being from the same town, same school and even having the same passion, I can fully relate to Stewart#s situation.I was very close to giving up so many times when I was at school. Being told by both pupils and even teachers to stop YouTube - it was a very stressful environment.Belfast Most ReadPolice believe blaze at Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building was deliberate hate crime Coronavirus: Northern Ireland records highest daily number of deaths as CMOs in cross border stay-at-home pleaWe have given blood for Union: Paisley launches scathing attack on Boris Johnson over post-Brexit supply issuesWitness to assault that resulted in death of Darren O#Neill at Tyrella beach breaks down giving evidence Girlwith autism left traumatised after #explosive-type devices# thrown at Armagh homesLatest Northern IrelandInternational travellers must isolate on arrival in NI as travel corridor scrappedLarge retailers urged to stop selling non-essential goods‘Highly unlikely’ NI lockdown restrictions will be eased after six weeks – SwannTwo children test positive for Covid- in Woodlands Juvenile Justice CentreSmall retailers call for ‘level playing field’ during restrictionsLatest from Belfast International travellers must isolate on arrival in NI as travel corridor scrappedDillian Whyte’s rematch against Alexander Povetkin scheduled for March Large retailers urged to stop selling non-essential goodsUK scraps travel corridors to protect against new strains of coronavirusCoronavirus hospital admissions set to peak in next  days, Whitty says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But negotiators did not include NI in the quota arrangement, according to market watchers.Analysts Argus flagged up the extra charge after a briefing by UK customs and HMRC. Traders were informed in a conference call with government agencies.The duty has been imposed without warning, Argus said in a briefing paper.Following Brexit, the UK has its own quarterly steel safeguard for January-June , mirroring the European system, the company said.The quota started on  January, after the end of the Brexit transition period. Northern Ireland is not included in the quota, but all steel - unless it originates in the UK - will still incur % safeguard duties. Seamus Murchan, co-owner of Lambeg-based KME Steelworks, said his firm attempted to secure as much product as possible ahead of the end of the transition period, because of the uncertainty.But when we went to our main suppliers, reliable and of quality, we found the supply was limited, said Mr Murchan, whose company sources from suppliers where in the UK so will be affected by the % tarf.It has been no better since the start of the year and still waiting on some.Mr Murchan said the firm, which designs and manufactures steel moulds for the construction and agriculture sector among other products, said customers are aware of the global price issues, but the company has tried to hold off increases as long as possible.He warned that there will be price hikes in the near future.The safeguard refers to protecting European steel from US imports, in place for several years.At least one trader has already been charged % duty for material that cleared into the Republic of Ireland, while others have been sending steel into Northern Ireland without realising they would have to make such a payment, the analysts reported.This highlights the uncertainty and confusion surrounding steel sold into Northern Ireland that does not originate in Great Britain.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland produce can feed  million, Poots told after his #no food# warningsNorthern Ireland produces enough to feed its entire population five times over, a supplier has said after a Stormont minister claimed hospitals and schools faced the prospect of being unable to feed patients and children.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UK and WorldCost a Lidl less: Lidl narrowly beats Aldi to be named cheapest supermarket Lidl has narrowly beaten Aldi to be named the cheapest supermarket of , according to Which  analysis.Most ReadPolice believe blaze at Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building was deliberate hate crime Coronavirus: Northern Ireland records highest daily number of deaths as CMOs in cross border stay-at-home pleaWe have given blood for Union: Paisley launches scathing attack on Boris Johnson over post-Brexit supply issuesWitness to assault that resulted in death of Darren O#Neill at Tyrella beach breaks down giving evidence Girlwith autism left traumatised after #explosive-type devices# thrown at Armagh homesLatest Northern Ireland‘Highly unlikely’ NI lockdown restrictions will be eased after six weeks – SwannTwo children test positive for Covid- in Woodlands Juvenile Justice CentreSmall retailers call for ‘level playing field’ during restrictionsChurch of Ireland apologises following mother and baby homes reportChurch of Ireland Archbishops speak of shame members were #complicit# in culture which stigmatised unmarried womenLatest from Belfast UK scraps travel corridors to protect against new strains of coronavirusCoronavirus hospital admissions set to peak in next  days, Whitty saysMauricio Pochettino to self-isolate after positive Covid- test more people die in Ireland with Covid-‘Highly unlikely’ NI lockdown restrictions will be eased after six weeks – Swann,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Glenullin man looked back on the special year. Michael McMullan writes... *** Its the Friday before the  All-Ireland minor final and Gerard OKane waits impatiently for the final bell in St Patricks College Maghera. Like a child on Christmas Eve. As the clock drags its way towards four oclock, ious teachers drop by to wish him luck on the Everest of Sundays in Irelands sporting calendar. A genuine warmth, willing him to bring back the silverware. Exactly  months earlier, OKane was a spectator in Croke Park as the Tyrone minor team that handed Derry a - to - hammering earlier in the summer were held by Dublin. The Red Hands won the replay by  points, a side that produced eight All-Ireland senior winners, including Sean Cavanagh, Joe McMahon and Martin Penrose, who OKane marked. googletag.cmd.push When the next season swung into action, Tyrone ran Derry to a point in the Ulster Final. It was the closest anyone came, as Derrys unstoppable force romped to the All-Ireland with an average winning margin of  points across their six-game odyssey. It was the first year of the back door and it included a -point mauling of Munster finalists Tipperary in the All-Ireland Quarter-Final. OKane remembers a message from Dermot McNicholl, his club mate and fellow All-Ireland winning captain. “He called to the house around that time and was just saying we had to beat what was in front of us,” OKane states. googletag.cmd.push One of the final knocks on OKanes classroom door on that everlasting Friday afternoon was from McNicholl. Standing outside in the corridor, the message was two-fold. First, came the wish of good luck. It was followed by a word of advice. In , McNicholl was left all alone in the Hogan Stand presentation area while the rest of the squad danced a jig of delight on Croke Parks hallowed turf. “If you are lucky enough to win,” was the theme of McNicholls warning. “There will be a guy come on the pitch and his job is to get the winning captain for the presentation of the cup....dont go to him.”     The man was head Croke Park steward John Leonard and as result, McNicholl missed the two minutes of joy with his team mates. “I was conscious of that,” OKane now knew. “The fella wouldve been just looking for the Derry number three.” Thankfully for OKane and Derry, the prophecy came to pass. He got offside long enough to embrace manager Chris Brown and his father Gerard – then the County Chairman – before bouncing around Croke Park with the squad. The bliss of success. “There is usually a rush to get the minor teams off the field,” OKane says. “But it didnt seem to be like that for us. We had half an hour after the final whistle. We had that time to spend with ourselves and do a lap of honour.” They soaked up every lasting memory of an afternoon that saw Armagh wrestle their way past Kerry in an epic encounter to win their first senior title. The following afternoon, the teams victory cavalcades would coincide at the Carrickdale, among thongs of fans and the sirens of the Garda escort, as both cups passed into the six counties, in the same year, for the first time. “Both teams were in big Chambers buses and when we arrived the Armagh people thought we were the Armagh team,” OKane recalls. Both Kieran McGeeney and OKane, with the respective cups, flanked by owner hotel John McParland, a huge GAA man, they exited through a fire escape and onto a flat roof above the fans outside. A moment to remember. “There were literally thousands upon thousands of people,” OKane adds. It was a moment worth waiting for. *** The unique aspect of that minor team was the spread of clubs. OKane and goalkeeper Eoin McNicholl hailed from Glenullin, but the rest were from across the county. “The  outfield players were from dferent clubs, so we had a better balance,” said OKane. Paul Young was the only survivor from the  Ulster winning team. OKane was one of a handful on the  squad. The rest were assembled by Chris Brown and his management team of Paddy Crozier, Charlie OKane, Bernie Henry and the late Aidan OBrien. In February, St Patricks Maghera exited the MacRory Cup and  players were called up for county duty, as Derry began their assault on Ulster. Mickey Drumm, as OKane recalls, was very unlucky, having dislocated his shoulder and missed out. It was never said, but the group knew they had the tools to give Ulster a shake. The management kept their powder dry and the squad grounded. After a convincing - to - win over Antrim in Casement Park, thanks to - from Barry McGoldrick and a Ciaran Mullan goal, they were up against Cavan who were hotly tipped after a seven-point victory over Down. Ciaran Mullan in action against Joe Ball of Tyrone in the Ulster final  “Cavan had a strong team, with Seanie Johnson, Mark McKeever, Anthony Gaynor, Paddy Brady and Sean Brady,” rolled the litany of names effortlessly off OKanes tongue. It was the first season of the back door. Getting to a provincial final offered a safety net, guaranteeing a passage into the All-Ireland series. “I remember Paddy and Chris saying to me,we got over this game we wouldnt be far away from the All-Ireland. “Cavan was a tough one, even though we only beat Tyrone by a point in the final,” Gerard offers. It was a standalone tie on a Saturday evening in Enniskillen, due to GAAs accommodation of the Leaving Cert examinations. In a tight encounter, Derry pulled away and ran out four-point winners, - to -. It was their passport to the summer. Waiting in the final was a Tyrone team Derry had beaten in a challenge match in the lull before their Cavan showdown. “They knew us inside out,” OKane states. It was a game Derry looked like leaving behind them, with Tyrone five points ahead entering the final  minutes. “We looked dead and buried, we didnt play well, but something just clicked. We clawed back one or two points,” said OKane. Aaron Cassidy came of the bench to kick a beauty, one of the six unanswered points as Derry clawed to victory, - to -. There was another moment, the key one. Seated in the dugout, beside Gerard senior, was Derry selector, the Aidan OBrien. “One of the points came after a turnover by Paul Young. He made a block on their full-back on his way out and won a free,” states Gerard junior. “It wouldnt have been Pauls style and Aidan turned to Daddy and said we were going to win it... that was the turning point. We were probably the better team, but didnt show it in the first  minutes.” By the time the giddy Derry squad filed out of the minor dressing rooms in Clones, the senior decider was under way and Armagh had the ball in the back of the net after an early error by Donegal goalkeeper Tony Blake. The Derry players took up their seats and watched Joe Kernans Armagh team of gladiators pick up the Anglo Celt Cup, a group that became the main billing ahead of Derry in Croker later in the summer. Before celebrating with the team, later that night in Magheras Walshs Hotel, it was back home to Glenullin for OKane. “My father was heavily involved and our house was a ceili house anyway,” Gerard states. “I can remember Danny McNicholl was there...and a few others waiting on me and the cup was there.” For now, it was time to swap the tracksuit for the disco clothes and meet with the squad in Maghera. On the way home from Walshs Hotel, in the wee small hours, there was a stop off in Slaughtneil to finish off the celebrations. “Id say, and Im not exaggerating,  of us stayed in Patsy Bradleys house that night,” he laughs. “They have a third or fourth floor and his mother had blankets for us. I remember Mickeyand three or four aul hands sitting around the kitchen table.” Derrys battles for supremacy were over, but they only just getting into their stride. It was time for their All-Ireland victory procession. *** Tipperary were the first victims of that Derry machine in a - to - hammering in Navan, with Paul Young hitting -. Longford beat Meath in the Leinster Final, with - from dangerman Michael Hussey who was the championship top scorer that year, with a tally of -. He got no change from Michael McGoldrick in defence, as Derry ran out winners by another big margin, - to -. “It left us feeling a bit undercooked going into the final, but minor football is a bit like that where you can build up big scores on a team,” said OKane “We were still quietly confident thatLongford could beat Meath and we beat Longford by the margin we did, we would give Meath a game.” Eoin McNicholl celebrates the semi-final win over Longford  The Royals were a more imposing team. None more so than at full forward, where OKane was tasked with marking man mountain Joe Sheridan. “I was ” and luckyI was ten stone and he was built like a man. Theyd a couple of boys at midfield who were the same and a strong half back line,” OKane adds. “Maybe the wide open spaces suited us, we were full of footballers and had a lot of speed on our team.” Time and time again, OKane would play in front and cut off the supply. It wasnt a tactic of the management. It was OKanes natural game and he had the experience of playing there for Glenullin seniors who reached the last four of the championship that season. Earlier in the year he played at centre back in the MacRory Cup, in front of full-back Mark Lynch. When Conleth Moran came back to fitness after the Ulster championship, he forced his way back into the attack for the All-Ireland campaign. The unlucky man to lose out was Glenullin man Neal Mullan. “I think theywere toying with the idea of putting Mark to full-back, but I was playing well there,so they let it be and put Mark at six.” Ciaran McCallion moved from centre back to the wing and Derrys formula was complete. As with any final, comes the sideshow of free gloves and boots, getting measured up for suits and the arrangements for the banquet. In the background, Paddy Croziers eye for detail picked up a distraction seeping into the squad. On the Monday before the final, he called the captain to one side. It was time for a quiet word, one that would have a greater impactit didnt come from the management. Another small detail in their quest for glory. “In some ways it was a bit manufactured,” OKane admits. The squad headed to a corner of Owenbeg. “We went and did our own stretching. We said we could buy all the tracksuits and suits, but you cant buy a medal. Is it about a night out in Dublin, or going down to win an All-Ireland  It meant more coming from us than the management.” All the pieces were in place as the squad departed for their Burlington Hotel base on Saturday afternoon. It was packed with people and a strange change from their semi-final base out in Portmarnock. Any background noise didnt filter into a group on a mission. A goal from Ruairi Convery put Derry into a position of strength and with Sheridan starved of possession, Meath moved him outfield to get him into the game. It was a mark of Derrys defence and in particular their full-back line of OKane, Michael McGoldrick and Joe Keenan, who didnt concede a score from play on their way to the final. “I sort of let the side down,” Gerard jokes about the final. “I conceded a point of Brian Farrell, who was moved across to me when they took Sheridan out.” By that stage, Derry had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Tom Markham Cup. Title number four was in the bag. “I remember standing with my back to the Hill in the second half and I could hear people I knew shouting behind me,” said OKane. “We were comfortable in the last five or ten minutes, you were able to take in the atmosphere rather than being in the zone all the time.” Referee Michael Ryans final whistle made it official. Derry were champions and Gerard remembered to escape the clutches of John Leonard. It was celebration time. The Derry players celebrate victory over Meath in the All-Ireland Final  Back at the Burlington, the staff had a guard of honour in place and upstairs, their suits were all laid out for the banquet. After leaving the Carrickdale on the Monday evening, the squad were ferried up a packed Maghera street on an open top bus. A tradition that began with the  minors. At Glen club, Gerard senior took the microphone to introduce the entire  and management. A homecoming befitting of All-Ireland champions. The following night, the cup was taken back to Derry City, before ing to Glenullin, the first club to host the squad. It was the start of a whistle-stop tour of every club in the county. “We did every club in the county for the next four or five nights,” Gerard adds. “Wed get on the bus in Dungiven around half four or five oclock and wouldnt be back til around . Looking back on it now, it was a bit mad with boys having to go back to school.” It was striking while the iron was hot and inspiring the next generation of players. The Derry squad joined Armagh for a civic reception at Stormont. John Dallat took the young Oakleafers on a tour of the building. “I remember meeting Mark Durkan at the banquet in Dublin, and these were boys you saw on TV,” OKane adds. “The week before the final, MrsOHagan handed me a letter in class, addressed to me at the school from Martin McGuinness who was the Minister for Education at the time. “I have pulled out that letter and have got it framed during lockdown, as well as the photos and all the jersies. Im thinking how lucky I was. I have great experiences out of it and made great friends out of it...you instantly click with them straight away.” A team that swatted all in its path to an All-Ireland title.

It follows the recent decision to scrap the Third Level competitions earlier in the week. The All-Ireland camogie series in Seniorand Junioracross four grades in camogie would normally begin this weekend while the football and hurling semi-finals, including the Hogan Cup, usually come into play in March. With schools in both jurisdictions currently shut the two Councils met separately on Tuesday night before issuing similar statements cancelling the competitions. The Post Primary Schools’ GAA statement emphasised the necessity to observe all relevant Covid protocols, and their determination to continue to do so for the duration of the current emergency. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile the Post Primary Camogie statement indicated that the uncertainty over when schools would re-open has made it very unlikely that there would be any sporting activity in term two. However both bodies emphasised that the decision to abandon the All-Ireland series does not preclude the possibility of some internal activity at provincial level should the current public health situation improve sufficiently. It is understood that the provincial bodies in both codes are due to meet shortly to discuss the implications of the All-Ireland decisions and plan ahead for the rest of the academic year. Both had indicated pre-Christmas their desire to run off competitions, including the MacRory and Mageean Cups, in a straight, finish on the day, knock-out format before the Easter holidays. That now seems very unlikely. googletag.cmd.push The lockdown last March cancelled all activity in football and hurling with a number of the All-Ireland semi-finals already played. Camogie on the other hand managed to run off all eight of their national competitions with, St Colm’s Draperstown winning the All-Ireland junior title. “We look forward to brighter days when Gaelic Games in schools can restart, and resume their unique contribution to the personal development of students, their physical and emotional wellbeing, their le skills, their sense of contentment with school le, their allegiance to school, and, consequently, the atmosphere and equanimity within each school, said Seamus Woods, Chairman of the All-Ireland Post Primary GAA Committee.     “The contribution made by Gaelic Games at schools’ level reaches far above and beyond the games themselves, and that is why their place in the GAA firmament must be cherished and protected”.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The cup was presented to Ulster Colleges in  by the staff and students of Dromantine College, Newry in memory of Most Reverend Daniel Mageean, Bishop of Down and Connorand St MacNissi’s Garron Tower were the first winners. Council Treasurer Sean McGourty says the decision to research and publish a history is a direct response to the enthusiasm that greeted the publication of the story of the MacRory Cup in . googletag.cmd.push “We got tremendous feedback from the publication of The MacRory Cup seven years ago. We sold , copies quite quickly and the book was very well received not only by our schools but indeed by the general GAA public. “Now we feel the time is right to mark  years of the Danske Bank Mageean Cup with a similar type of enterprise,” said McGourty who coached his own school De La Salle College in Belfast to two finals a couple of decades ago. McGourty goes on to say that, despite its relative youth, researching the Mageean Cup history could be a lot more problematic in comparison to the MacRory Cup competition which is just a few years short of its centenary. googletag.cmd.push “There was a huge amount of research undertaken long before the author JA Walshe sat down to write the MacRory Cup book. But for the most part there was documentation available in the form of match reports and photographs in the winning schools. “It is fair to say that during that period the Ulster Schools’ Council allowed the hurling schools to organise games between themselves and only got involved when medals were needed. “Hurling was played at that age level in fewer schools and often there was no actual Mageean Cup final. Often in the s and s there was a mini league which St Mary’s CBGS Belfast won easily.     “So with no final and often one-sided games played on a week-day there would have been little coverage in the local or regional press and that would have been reflected in the schools themselves. There are many winning teams that were never photographed at all.” During the s the competition expanded with Armagh CBS, St Patrick’s Maghera and St Louis Ballymena all winning their first titles and with that expansion came a more organised approach to the staging of Mageean Cup finals. The MacRory Cup and other football competitions evolved out of the need to keep boarders in the diocesan seminaries occupied over weekends. It quickly gained a prestige and the winning team was photographed in school with the trophy soon after the final. Hurling on the other hand tended to be played in day-schools run by the Christian Brothers encouraged by men from hurling counties through Munster and south Leinster.In the s for example Abbey CBS represented Down in inter-county hurling at minor level, winning a couple of provincial titles and appearing in All-Ireland semi-finals. However few of these Christian Brothers’ schools extended to Sixth Form and therefore they could not compete at senior level. Hence there were hardly any schools in rural Ulster able to play for the Mageean Cup. St MacNissi’s College Garron Tower was opened in  mainly to cope with the overflow from St Malachy’s College, the diocesan seminary. The day pupils there played mainly hurling while the boarders competed in football. Indeed the school won the  Rannafast Cup in between lting the first two Mageean Cup titles. That inaugural Mageean Cup competition in - included St Marys CBS, St Malachys College and St Michaels College, Omeath. Ballycastle’s Eddie Donnelly was a key member of the winning Garron Tower team. The two other schools in north Antrim, Cross and Passion Ballycastle and St Louis Ballymena, started le as girls’ schools and only began admitting boys around the time that the Mageean Cup was getting up and running. Ballycastle’s first win didn’t come until - and, like St MacNissi’s, they also completed back-to-back titles with Brian Donnelly and Olcan McFetridge in the team. However it took the school another  years before a third title arrived, while St Louis Ballymena’s only win before  came in the - season. The competition was dominated by St Mary’s CBGS Belfast who collected  of the first  titles and it wasn’t until the emergence of St Patrick’s Maghera in the early s that the Glen Road school was really challenged on an annual basis. Currently the Mageean Cup is enjoying its most competitive phase with five dferent winners during the last five seasons. The Ulster Schools’ Council is keen to hear from players who participated in the Mageean Cup, to record their memories of the competition, of the finals and how the team was prepared in inidual schools. They would also be very interested in photographs of winning teams, indeed any photographs of games during the first three decades.

Danielle Steel has been a particular favourite for me, while my husband has continued with his love of Dickens, Steinbeck and Hemingway.”  Despite not visiting family, they have kept in touch. “FaceTime calling has become a regular occurrence, with calls to our grandchildren and listening to our grandson read stories from his school book.”--If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Although only detailed family history research will confirm the actual Irish origins of your ancestors, surname histories can provide clues and insight into family origins. The  Foyle Community Directory lists , unique surnames in Derry city. Each of these surnames bears a distinctive history and taken as a whole they are a record of population movements into the Derry area over the past  years. Derry’s dynamic history can be seen in the richness and iety of her surnames. googletag.cmd.push The three commonest names have Donegal origins with Doherty heading the way with  entries, followed by McLaughlin on  and Gallagher with  entries. By way of contrast,  surnames occur only once.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan and sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either ‘Mac’or ‘O’to the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a ‘sept’. A sept can be identied as ‘a group of persons who, or whose immediate and known ancestors, bore a common surname and inhabited the same locality’. As a consequence, Gaelic-Irish surnames are still very dominant and numerous in the very districts where their names originated. By tradition, many of the prominent surnames of Gaelic origin in Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone today trace their descent from either Eoghan or Conal Gulban, two of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, King of Tara who was slain in  AD.     Those tracing descent from Eoghan include: Brolly, Carlin, Devlin, Donnelly, Duddy, Duffy, Farren, Gormley, Hegarty, McCloskey, McLaughlin, Mellon, Mullen, O’Hagan, O’Kane, O’Neill, Quinn and Toner. From Conall Gulban: Doherty, Friel, Gallagher, McCafferty, McDaid, McDevitt and O’Donnell. By tradition, Eoghan and Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland about  AD, and in the process captured the great hill-top fortication of Grianaacuten of Aileach in Inishowen, County Donegal which overlooks the city of Derry and the surrounding countryside. Although Gaelic society was one of the first to adopt a system of hereditary surnames it was also one of the last to perpetuate fixed surnames. People in these societies, in the early th century, were often designated by their genealogies stretching back five or more generations. For example, Shane O’Neill of Shane’s Castle, County Antrim, styled himself on the family vault, which he built in , as ‘Shane McBrien McPhelim McShane McBrien McPhelim O’Neill Esq’. Here is family history in one name stretching back over  years. The last-named Phelim was Felim ‘The Lame’ who was Prince of Clanaboy from  to . The Genealogical Office manuscript collections in Office of the Chief Herald at National Library of Ireland, Dublin are the most important source for the genealogies of Gaelic families and of those families entitled to bear arms either by hereditary right or by grant. On th July , Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen, County Donegal. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, known today as ‘St Columb’s Stone’, inside the walled garden in the grounds of the former Belmont House School, Racecourse Road, Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: the claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood. By tradition, the crowning stone, blessed by Saint Columba, was carried to Belmont from Grianan of Aileach. By tradition, Grianan is identied as being the great “royal fort” of Aileach, the citadel of the northern Ui Neill from the th to the th century. With the Genealogical Office manuscript collections a family chart can be constructed which, on the male line, records the ancestors of Ramon O’Dogherty, “Chief of the Name”, back through  generations to Niall of the Nine Hostages, th century High King of Ireland Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sean, brother of Sir Cahir O’Doherty , who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The founder of the Spanish branch of the O’Doghertys was John who, on the death of his father Eoghan in , came out with his brothers Henry and Clinton Dillon to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the most exclusive branch of the Spanish armed forces. Entry required them to show their genealogy, proving noble origin. In  the King of Arms in Dublin Castle confirmed the three brothers as being “descended in a direct line from Shane or Sir John O’Dogherty, Chief of Innish-Owen”. In the th century substantial numbers of English and Scottish families settled in the northern part of Ireland during the so-called Plantation of Ulster. These settlers came to Ulster, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and, finally, in the fteen years after  and the Glorious Revolution. Famine in Scotlandfrom -, together with landlords in Ulster actively seeking new tenants, resulted in a massive influx of Scottish settlers to Ulster in the s. Substantial numbers of Scottish families entered Ulster through Derry and settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of Counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire the Clyde Valley Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries in Galloway and the Border Lands of Berwick, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Hence surnames such as Anderson, Arbuckle, Armstrong, Barr, Beattie, Bell, Buchanan, Burns, Campbell, Carruthers, Colhoun, Craig, Cunningham, Dunlop, Elliott, Ferguson, Finlay, Fleming, Frazer, Gillespie, Graham, Grant, Hamilton, Hanna, Haslett, Henderson, Holmes, Houston, Irvine, Irwin, Johnston, Kennedy, Kilgore, Lindsay, McAllister, McCartney, McClean, McClelland, McClintock, McCorkell, McCormick, McDonald, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Moore, Olphert, Orr, Parkhill, Patterson, Patton, Rankin, Robb, Rosborough, Ross, Scott, Starrett, Stewart, Thompson, Wallace, Wilson and Young have been established in northwest Ireland for well over three centuries. More recent arrivals from outside the British Isles have also contributed a small but interesting collection of surnames in the Derry area. An Italian community with surnames such as Battisti, Caffola, Cassoni, Centra, Corrieri, Del Pinto, Fiorentini, Forte, Macari, Vaccaro and Yannarelli settled in Derry in the s. A Jewish community with names such as Schenkel, Szilagyi, Spain and Watchman settled in Derry and worshipped in a synagogue in Kennedy Place, and a thriving Indian Community, represented by surnames such as Chada, Singh, Vig and Vij, has been established in the city since the s, most of whom originate from the Punjab in northern India. The family histories associated with surname histories in Derry will, in many instances, be recorded in the database of Derry Genealogy at www.derry.rootsireland.ie.  The database of Derry Genealogy contains the bulk of pre- civil birth and marriage registers for the city and county of Derry, the early baptismal and marriage registers of  churches , gravestone inscriptions from  graveyards, and census substitutes and census s dating from  to . Starting in Mondays Derry News, we look in depth at the history of our local surnames. First up are the four most common - Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this, the first of a series of articles on the most common  local surnames, he explores the background of the names Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  - DOHERTY The surname Doherty, which is by far the most popular name in the city of Derry and the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. googletag.cmd.push The Doherty sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push The Dohertys take their name from Dochartach, twelfth in lineal descent from Conall Gulban and were thus in Gaelic O Dochartaigh. The word dochartach means ‘hurtful’. The original seat of the Doherty clan was at Ardmire or Ard Miodhair, a district to the west of Ballybofey near Lough Finn, County Donegal. In  Donnell Carragh O’Doherty was styled ‘Royal Chieftain of Ardmire’. As the original homeland of the Cenel Eoghainin Inishowen became more and more a northern outpost, as they expanded south and east, the O’Dohertys, a powerful branch of the Cenel Conaill , forced their way into Inishowen.     When Conor O’Doherty died in  he was styled ‘Chief of Ardmire, and Lord of Inishowen’. The Dohertys remained the chief family of Inishowen until their influence was broken after the rebellion of Sir Cahir O’Doherty in , which included the ransacking of the city of Derry. The defeat and execution of Sir Cahir O’Doherty marked the end of Doherty power and paved the way for the th century Plantation of Ulster with English and Scottish settlers. In the centuries that followed the name was anglicised with many iant spellings and in nearly all cases the O prefix was dropped. By  only  per cent were still using it. However, in the th century, many resumed it and by  half of the Dohertys in Ireland had become O’Doherty again.In the th and th centuries many descendants of the old Gaelic order in Ireland emigrated, as the so-called Wild Geese, to Europe, and, in particular, to Spain and France. Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated in July  as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen. Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sir Cahir’s brother John who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, which tradition states was carried from Grianan, in the grounds of the former Belmont House School in Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: The claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood.   – MCLAUGHLIN  The surname McLaughlin, which is second to Doherty in both Derry city and Inishowen, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Today, % of Donegal McLaughlins are still concentrated in the Inishowen peninsula. The McLaughlin sept trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The McLaughlins take their name from Lochlainn, which in turn was derived from a Norse personal name, and were thus in Gaelic Mac Lochlainn, i.e. son of Lochlainn. The McLaughlins were initially the senior branch of the Northern Ui Neill and their territory was in Inishowen. In the th century the McLaughlins, ruling from their royal palace at Ailech in Inishowen, were High Kings of Ireland and patrons of the monastic settlement in Derry. Domhnall Mac Lochlainn, styled ‘King of Ireland’, died at Doire-Choluim-Chillein . After a decisive battle in  at Caimeirgethe O’Neills of Tyrone ousted the McLaughlins as the leading power in Ulster. Brian O’Neill was now ‘installed in the lordship of the Kinel-Owen’. In the th century the Dohertys ousted the McLaughlins as Lords of Inishowen. Some McLaughlins in Ulster, particularly Antrim, may derive from the Argyllshire clan known in Scotland as MacLachlan. The O’Melaghlins of north Leinster have also changed their name to McLaughlin.   - GALLAGHER  Gallagher is the third most common name in Ulster and two-thirds of the Ulster total are in the sept’s homeland of County Donegal where it is the most numerous name. Although it is only the thirteenth most common name in County Derry, it is the third most numerous in the city of Derry. This name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. The Gallagher sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Conall, styled ‘King of Tir Conaill’, established his own kingdom in County Donegal called after him Tyrconnel, i.e. the ‘Land of Conall’, which was the ancient name of Donegal. His descendants, known as the Cenel Conaill , formed one of the principal branches of the Northern Ui Neill . The septs of the Cenel Conaill firmly established themselves in County Donegal while those descended from Conal’s brother Eogan expanded to the east and south into Counties Derry and Tyrone. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The Gallaghers take their name from Gallchobhair, and were thus in Gaelic O Gallchobhair, i.e. descendant of Gallagher. This name is derived from gallchobhar, meaning ‘foreign help’. The O’Gallaghers claim to be the senior and most loyal family of the Cenel Conaill. Their territory extended over a wide area in the baronies of Raphoe and Tirhugh in the east and south of County Donegal. The O’Gallaghers, from their bases at Ballybeit and Ballynaglack, were chief marshals and commanders of O’Donnell’s military forces from the th to the th centuries. The O’Gallaghers also provided many wives for the O’Donnell sept. As well as being a military family the Gallaghers have produced many churchmen. Six O’Gallaghers were bishops of Raphoe in the th and th centuries, and Redmond O Gallagher, the th century Bishop of Derry, befriended the survivors of the Spanish Armada. Today the name is found widely in Scotland where it often takes the form Gallacher. It also occurs in the English cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds where it is pronounced ‘Gallocher’.   – KELLY  Kelly is the second commonest family name in Ireland, after Murphy, and part of the reason is that, at least seven and possibly as many as ten distinct septs of the same name arose in dferent parts of the country. Kelly is the sixth most common name in Ulster, and the third most numerous in Counties Derry and Tyrone. The Kelly sept of County Derry trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula in County Donegal still called after him Inishowen . His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Kelly is derived from Gaelic O Ceallaigh, the root word possibly being ceallach meaning stre. The O’Kellys were one of the leading septs of Clan Binnypossessing territory on the banks of the River Foyle near Lford in County Donegal. The first outward thrust of the Owen clan was that of Clan Binny in the th century AD who thrust southeast into County Tyrone, bypassing a hard core of resistance in County Derry of the Cianachta, as far as the river Blackwater on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh. Clan Binny eventually ousted the Oriella clans from the district lying west of the river Bann from Coleraine to beside Lough Neagh, and drove them across the river. In the course of time the O’Kellys moved eastwards into County Derry and were based in the barony of Loughinsholin in south Derry. The most powerful Kelly sept was that of Ui Maine, often called Hy Many, who ruled O’Kelly’s Country in Counties Galway and Roscommon. This sept claims descent from the th century Colla da Crioch, King of Ulster and first King of Oriel. Other O’Kelly septs originated in Counties Kilkenny, Leix, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow. Kelly was known as a surname in Scotland long before th century Irish immigration really established the name there. There was, for example, a Kelly sept attached to Clan Donald. In Thursdays Derry News, Brian Mitchell looks at the history of the names Moore, Coyle, Harkin and Bradley.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was announced last night that the AQE transfer test for primary seven pupils in Northern Ireland, which had been scheduled to take place on February , has been cancelled. AQE have also said that no test will take place this school year. The single test was scheduled after the three tests due to take place in January were cancelled. Post-primary transfer tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools. A number of grammar schools had already said they would not use the test to select pupils this year. googletag.cmd.push Grammar schools who were planning to use the AQE test will now have to find alternative arrangements to admit pupils in . After the announcement was made last night, Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted: “AQE have decided, due to COVID-, that the transfer tests cannot proceed this year. This severely limits parental choice  children’s opportunities, with disappointment for many children  parents. I will continue to work with all stakeholders in these dficult circumstances.” However, his comments were taken by some as criticism of non-grammar schools. In response, Katrina Crilly, principal of Oakgrove College in Derry, wrote: “What a limited comment! This may be your perspective Minister narrow as it is, are you not the Education Minister for all our children and all our schools ” googletag.cmd.push Deirdre OKane, principal of St Patricks and St Brigids in Claudy, wrote: “Mr Weir. As principal of an exceptional non selective school, I an saddened by such a disgraceful, insensitive remark. Having attended a non- selective school myself, I was not, limited.” Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilias College in Derry, wrote: “This year we were named ‘UK Secondary School of the Year’ but here in N Ireland our education system will always deem us ‘second class’ because we are a secondary school and not grammar! Described by our own Education Minister as ‘limiting children’s opportunities’ - HOW DARE HE!” Mr Weir later tried to clary his comments by tweeting: “Great opportunities exist throughout our education system, thru both selective and non selective schools, all of which have produced the best of Northern Ireland. Once opportunity to be considered for entry to any school is denied,in any sector, it is a denial to opportunity  all.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade at the station, situated at Richill Park off the Crescent Link road in the Lisnagelvin area, includes  custody cells, offices, briefing rooms, catering, changing, storage and ancillary services as well as  parking spaces.The refurbishment also includes a fully automatic addressable fire alarm and detection, public address bomb alert system, fully integrated security, CCTV, perimeter detection, security lighting, electronic access control and staff alarm systems.As a result, nine custody suites at the PSNIs headquarters in the city on Strand Road will close on completion of the Waterside development. The work follows a review by the PSNI of its facilities across the North which will also see the closure of cutody suites in Bangor and Armagh.The PSNI said it had reviewed its custody suites because some were under-used and several needed to be updated to ensure they met health and safety requirements.More than , people are held in police cells every year, many of whom suffer from addiction and mental health problems.The PSNI say the aim is create a more effective and efficient custody service consisting of a fewer number of better-equipped suites, each of which will see the introduction of embedded healthcare and support services to help keep people safe. The PSNI estimate the closures will save around pound million in maintenance costs.It had been hoped to have the Waterside scheme completed later this year but no date has been put on a finish of the local work due to Covid-.. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister McConalogue said: “I am looking at what options might be available to address the situation. “Essentially, this situation is one of the signicant implications of the Brexit negotiations. However, we could have been in a much worse, a much more challenging scenariothere had not been a deal on Christmas Eve past. “It was a possibility access for Irish boats to British waters, which are obviously very close to the Donegal coast, could have been blocked off to our fishermen, and we catch one third of the national catch of fish in British waters. googletag.cmd.push “Also, in that scenario the Northern Irish-registered boats, which are the vessels we are talking about here, would not have had access or permission to come into Irish waters at all. Thankfully, as a result of the deal, that very stark scenario was avoided for our fishing sector,” said Minister McConalogue. Admitting the outcomes were “challenging”, Minister McConalogue they had to be “examined and addressed”. He added: “This [the situation in Greencastle] is one of those outcomes, which has resulted from the international legal status of Britain no longer being a member of the EU. “It requires any boats which are British-registered or Northern Irish-registered to land into designated ports in the Republic. I am very much aware of the issue this creates for local fishermen who fish using Northern Ireland boats. However, Northern Ireland boats now come under the UK fisheries policy rather than the EU Common Fisheries Policy. googletag.cmd.push “I am looking at what options might be available to address the situation. I am looking at them, obviously, with urgency. What we are talking about is the designation of ports, which would meet international criteria and any regulatory infrastructural requirements around that. I am currently investigating what would be required and what it would be possible to do. “I have been taking to many of the fishermen involved and very much understand the implications for them being able to carry out their livelihoods as they had done up until Brexit,” said Minister McConalogue.        --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that it has become such an issue that Northern Ireland Waterhas recommended that no further connections be made to the networkuntil the necessary work has been carried out to increase thecapacity. This will impact on any planning applications for new properties in the Culmore area. Details of the issues at Culmore Road have emerged after plans were put forward to build  new propertieson a site at  Culmore Road. At present, the site is home to one property, which is called Derrianna. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners of the site want to knock this house down and build  new propertieson the land. The plans for the Culmore Road site were lodged with Derry City and Strabane District Councilsplanning department in November . As part of the planning process, the council contacta range of agencies to ask for theirinputon the proposals. One of the agencies contacted was NI Water. In their response to the council about the plans for  Culmore Road,Robert O’Hare, from Ni Waters Developer Services, said they would have issues with the sewage system in the area. There is a mm diameter public foul sewer which is located on Culmore Road, that is adjacent and near the boundary of the proposed development site, Mr OHare wrote. googletag.cmd.push However, due to the sewer network being at capacity in the Culmore catchment and sewer flows spilling from CSOsinto the environment, NI Water is recommending to council planners that no further connections should be made to this network or a condition should be incorporated which requires an alternative drainage  treatment solution for the proposed site. It is understood that the owners of the site at  Culmore Road are now in discussions with NI Water to look at alternative ways of dealing with sewage from the proposed housing development. However, the fact that the sewage network in the area is at full capacity will continue to have an impact on proposed developments in the area.     The problems being caused by the restricted sewage system in Derry were discussed at Northern Ireland Executive level last year. In March last year, Foyle Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson asked Infra- structure Minister Nichola Mallon what stepsshe would be taking to ensure sewerage and wastewater capacity issues did not put building planning applications in Derry on hold. In response, the Minister said NI Water was progressing a Drainage Area Planin the Culmore area. The current forecast completion date for the DAP is summer autumn , she said. NI Waters role in the planning process is that of a statutory consultee. “It has been engaging with Derry City and Strabane District Council on wastewater system capacity issues over several years Over the last two years, substantial survey  investigative work has been undertaken throughout Derry to inform the DAP process, including flow survey, network asset surveys and CCTV investigations. At this point, NI Water will have a more detailed understanding of the capacity issues and as such be better positioned to provide outline solutions. Ms Mallon added: As Minister, I aim to ensure that my Department will do all it can to assist in tackling these capacity issues.However, my budget is subject to a number of competing priorities. “I have, therefore, engaged with the Finance Minister to highlight the critical need to secure the funding that I require to ensure sewerage and wastewater capacity issues do not put building planning applications in Derry and across the north on hold,” the Infrastructure Minister added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A quarter of all Moores in Ireland are in County Antrim alone and the name is common too in Counties Derry and Tyrone. In Northern Ireland, most Moores are of Scottish origin. This name, which is the seventh most common in the city of Derry, is regarded as the most numerous name in the city for which a gaelic origin is unlikely. Nowadays, Moore is quite common in the lowland hinterland to the east, west and south of Derry, but not in Inishowen.  googletag.cmd.push Although Moore is one of the  most numerous names in England, deriving from residence in or near a moor or heath, it also comes from that area in the south and west lowlands of Scotland which provided so many of the seventeenth century settlers in Ulster.  The surname was first noted there in a iety of places, including Ayrshire and Lanarkshire, in the th century. In Scotland, the name often took the form ‘Muir.’ There were Mores, a sept of Clan Leslie, and Muirs, a sept of Clan Campbell. The defeat of the old Gaelic order in the Nine Years War, -, and the escape of the most prominent Gaelic Lords of Ulster in ‘the Flight of the Earls’ in  from Lough Swilly, County Donegal were ultimately responsible for the settlement of many Scottish families in the northern counties of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push In  the Earl of Salisbury, Lord High Treasurer, suggested to James I a deliberate plantation of Scottish and English colonists on the forfeited estates of the Gaelic chiefs in counties Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Londonderryand Tyrone. Settlers to Ulster came, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and finally in the  years after  and the Glorious Revolution. It is estimated by , when Scottish migration to Ulster had virtually stopped, the Presbyterian population of Ulster, ie of essentially Scottish origin, stood at ,.     Scottish families entering Ireland through the port of Derry settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of counties Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in the county of Ayrshire, the Clyde Valley and the Border Lands consisting of the counties of Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Confusion arises because the Irish sept name of O’More was iniably changed to Moore. The O’Mores, derived from Gaelic O Mordha, meaning ‘majestic, were the leading sept of the ‘Seven Septs of Leix.’ They were based at Dunamanse, near Portlaoise, County Laoisin central Ireland. The ancestor who gave the O’Mores their name, ie Mordha, was st in descent from Conall Cearnach, the legendary hero of the Red Branch Knights of Ulster.   – COYLE This name is most common in Ulster in its homeland, County Donegal and in Counties Derry, Tyrone and Cavan. Coyle is among the top ten names in the city of Derry today. The name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a sept. Coyle is derived from Gaelic Mac Giolla Chomhgaill, meaning ‘son of the devotee of St Comgal.’ St Comgal was the patron of Galloon parish in south Fermanagh. This sept was based in the parish of Meevagh in the barony of Kilmacrenan in County Donegal. The name was first anglicised as McIlhoyle, then McCoyle and finally Coyle. One branch of the Coyles were erenaghs, ie hereditary stewards, of the church lands in Galloon Parish, County Fermanagh. Owing to the mistaken belief that the Gaelic word coill, meaning ‘wood,’ was part of this sept’s name, Mac Giolla Chomhgaill was often anglicised to Woods. Coyle has also become confused with McCool. Although the surnames of Coyle and McCool have quite distinct origins their ultimate origins have become confused as a result of anglicisation. In some cases people whose origins are Mac Giolla Chomhgaill of Kilmacrenan may be disguised by bearing the surname McCool. The origins of the name McCool are not certain. It has been suggested that McCool, derived from Mac Giolla Comhghaill, meaning ‘son of the devotee of St Comhghal’ or from Mac Comhghaill, is a distinct sept from the Raphoe area of County Donegal. The surname McCool is most common in Counties Donegal and Tyrone. This name has also been made Cole, which is a common English surname, in the Glenties area of Donegal. In Scotland MacCool can be a iant of MacDougall, Gaelic Mac Dhughaill. In a few cases, therefore, the name may have come with Scottish immigrants at the time of the Plantation of Ulster in the th century.   – HARKIN  Harkins are found only in Ulster where over half are in County Donegal and most of the rest in County Derry. The name is particularly associated with Inishowen, County Donegal. This name, which is among the top ten in the city of Derry, illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and Inishowen. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a sept. Harkin is derived from Gaelic O hEarcain, the root word being earc, meaning ‘red’. In  the Harkins were recorded as a ‘principal name’ in the barony of Inishowen, County Donegal. This sept’s association with Inishowen is recorded long before that, for the O’Harkins were erenaghs, i.e. hereditary stewards, of the church lands of Cloncha. One appears as such in Bishop Montgomery’s diocesan survey of . Daniel O’Harcan, who died in , was one of the Ulster martyrs defending the Roman Catholic faith. The Parish of Cloncha, which includes Malin Head, is the most northerly parish in Ireland. Many Inishowen families trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the fth century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca.  AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech,’ established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Today there are more Harkins in Derry city than in their original homeland of Inishowen.   – BRADLEY This name is most common in Ulster and, in particular, in County Derry, where it is the fourth most numerous, and in Counties Antrim, Donegal and Tyrone. The name is most concentrated in central and south Derry. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a sept. Bradley and O’Brollaghan, an earlier anglicized form of the name, are derived from Gaelic O Brollachain, meaning ‘descendant of Brollach’. Brollach is an old personal name, the root word being brollach, meaning ‘breast. The territory of this sept was the area which straddles the borders of Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone. In the th century, in particular, The Annals of The Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters makes many references to the O’Brollaghans. In  Flahertagh O’Brollaghan was appointed as ‘successor of Colum Cille’, i.e. Abbot of all monasteries under the rule of Colum Cille, which included Derry and Iona in Scotland. He began preparations for the erection of a new cathedral in Derry worthy of its distinguished founder, St Colum Cille . In , in the space of  days, Templemore or ‘the great church of Doire’ was erected near the original Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church. From this cathedral, the parish of Templemore, which contains the city of Derry, derived its name. Today, O’Brollaghan has been entirely anglicised to Bradley. In some instances, notably in County Derry, the earlier version of O’Brallaghan survived into the th century. For example the Hearth Money Rolls of  for Maghera Parish, County Derry records one Edmond O Brallaghan. A branch of the O’Brollaghans was established, in the th century, in the Highlands of Scotland through their connections with the monastery on Iona. Donal O’Brollaghan, prior of Derry, who died in , was Abbot of Iona in the th century. Here too the name was anglicised to Bradley. Another branch of the O’Brollaghans early migrated to County Cork and the numerous Bradleys of that area descend from them. Bradley is also an English name derived from many places of that name in northern England. Here Bradley is derived from the Old English bradleah, meaning ‘broad wood or clearing’. Few Bradleys in Ulster, however, are of English origin.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A quarter of all Moores in Ireland are in County Antrim alone and the name is common too in Counties Derry and Tyrone. In Northern Ireland, most Moores are of Scottish origin. This name, which is the seventh most common in the city of Derry, is regarded as the most numerous name in the city for which a gaelic origin is unlikely. Nowadays, Moore is quite common in the lowland hinterland to the east, west and south of Derry, but not in Inishowen.  googletag.cmd.push Although Moore is one of the  most numerous names in England, deriving from residence in or near a moor or heath, it also comes from that area in the south and west lowlands of Scotland which provided so many of the seventeenth century settlers in Ulster.  The surname was first noted there in a iety of places, including Ayrshire and Lanarkshire, in the th century. In Scotland, the name often took the form ‘Muir.’ There were Mores, a sept of Clan Leslie, and Muirs, a sept of Clan Campbell. The defeat of the old Gaelic order in the Nine Years War, -, and the escape of the most prominent Gaelic Lords of Ulster in ‘the Flight of the Earls’ in  from Lough Swilly, County Donegal were ultimately responsible for the settlement of many Scottish families in the northern counties of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push In  the Earl of Salisbury, Lord High Treasurer, suggested to James I a deliberate plantation of Scottish and English colonists on the forfeited estates of the Gaelic chiefs in counties Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Londonderryand Tyrone. Settlers to Ulster came, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and finally in the  years after  and the Glorious Revolution. It is estimated by , when Scottish migration to Ulster had virtually stopped, the Presbyterian population of Ulster, ie of essentially Scottish origin, stood at ,.     Scottish families entering Ireland through the port of Derry settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of counties Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in the county of Ayrshire, the Clyde Valley and the Border Lands consisting of the counties of Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Confusion arises because the Irish sept name of O’More was iniably changed to Moore. The O’Mores, derived from Gaelic O Mordha, meaning ‘majestic, were the leading sept of the ‘Seven Septs of Leix.’ They were based at Dunamanse, near Portlaoise, County Laoisin central Ireland. The ancestor who gave the O’Mores their name, ie Mordha, was st in descent from Conall Cearnach, the legendary hero of the Red Branch Knights of Ulster.   – COYLE This name is most common in Ulster in its homeland, County Donegal and in Counties Derry, Tyrone and Cavan. Coyle is among the top ten names in the city of Derry today. The name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a sept. Coyle is derived from Gaelic Mac Giolla Chomhgaill, meaning ‘son of the devotee of St Comgal.’ St Comgal was the patron of Galloon parish in south Fermanagh. This sept was based in the parish of Meevagh in the barony of Kilmacrenan in County Donegal. The name was first anglicised as McIlhoyle, then McCoyle and finally Coyle. One branch of the Coyles were erenaghs, ie hereditary stewards, of the church lands in Galloon Parish, County Fermanagh. Owing to the mistaken belief that the Gaelic word coill, meaning ‘wood,’ was part of this sept’s name, Mac Giolla Chomhgaill was often anglicised to Woods. Coyle has also become confused with McCool. Although the surnames of Coyle and McCool have quite distinct origins their ultimate origins have become confused as a result of anglicisation. In some cases people whose origins are Mac Giolla Chomhgaill of Kilmacrenan may be disguised by bearing the surname McCool. The origins of the name McCool are not certain. It has been suggested that McCool, derived from Mac Giolla Comhghaill, meaning ‘son of the devotee of St Comhghal’ or from Mac Comhghaill, is a distinct sept from the Raphoe area of County Donegal. The surname McCool is most common in Counties Donegal and Tyrone. This name has also been made Cole, which is a common English surname, in the Glenties area of Donegal. In Scotland MacCool can be a iant of MacDougall, Gaelic Mac Dhughaill. In a few cases, therefore, the name may have come with Scottish immigrants at the time of the Plantation of Ulster in the th century.   – HARKIN  Harkins are found only in Ulster where over half are in County Donegal and most of the rest in County Derry. The name is particularly associated with Inishowen, County Donegal. This name, which is among the top ten in the city of Derry, illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and Inishowen. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a sept. Harkin is derived from Gaelic O hEarcain, the root word being earc, meaning ‘red’. In  the Harkins were recorded as a ‘principal name’ in the barony of Inishowen, County Donegal. This sept’s association with Inishowen is recorded long before that, for the O’Harkins were erenaghs, i.e. hereditary stewards, of the church lands of Cloncha. One appears as such in Bishop Montgomery’s diocesan survey of . Daniel O’Harcan, who died in , was one of the Ulster martyrs defending the Roman Catholic faith. The Parish of Cloncha, which includes Malin Head, is the most northerly parish in Ireland. Many Inishowen families trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the fth century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca.  AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech,’ established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Today there are more Harkins in Derry city than in their original homeland of Inishowen.   – BRADLEY This name is most common in Ulster and, in particular, in County Derry, where it is the fourth most numerous, and in Counties Antrim, Donegal and Tyrone. The name is most concentrated in central and south Derry. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a sept. Bradley and O’Brollaghan, an earlier anglicized form of the name, are derived from Gaelic O Brollachain, meaning ‘descendant of Brollach’. Brollach is an old personal name, the root word being brollach, meaning ‘breast. The territory of this sept was the area which straddles the borders of Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone. In the th century, in particular, The Annals of The Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters makes many references to the O’Brollaghans. In  Flahertagh O’Brollaghan was appointed as ‘successor of Colum Cille’, i.e. Abbot of all monasteries under the rule of Colum Cille, which included Derry and Iona in Scotland. He began preparations for the erection of a new cathedral in Derry worthy of its distinguished founder, St Colum Cille . In , in the space of  days, Templemore or ‘the great church of Doire’ was erected near the original Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church. From this cathedral, the parish of Templemore, which contains the city of Derry, derived its name. Today, O’Brollaghan has been entirely anglicised to Bradley. In some instances, notably in County Derry, the earlier version of O’Brallaghan survived into the th century. For example the Hearth Money Rolls of  for Maghera Parish, County Derry records one Edmond O Brallaghan. A branch of the O’Brollaghans was established, in the th century, in the Highlands of Scotland through their connections with the monastery on Iona. Donal O’Brollaghan, prior of Derry, who died in , was Abbot of Iona in the th century. Here too the name was anglicised to Bradley. Another branch of the O’Brollaghans early migrated to County Cork and the numerous Bradleys of that area descend from them. Bradley is also an English name derived from many places of that name in northern England. Here Bradley is derived from the Old English bradleah, meaning ‘broad wood or clearing’. Few Bradleys in Ulster, however, are of English origin.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While all of this is well rehearsed, it is no less important because it has been said so many times before.ldquoOne of the first things for me is about all of us behaving aswe have Covid, in terms of social distancing, hand washing and minimising contacts.She appealed to people to only come to hospital when they need to and not to turn up when they donrsquot need to.ldquoWe know that there are instances where it is absolutely vitally important that people present themselvesthey have chest pain orthey think they are having a stroke. It is really important to emphasise that the service is still here for you, continued Ms Patterson.ldquoBut equally for those who do not require an emergency service or hospital at this point in time, we are appealing to you to make these measured judgements.The nursing director said as the coming weeks are going to be dficult, hospitals are not going to be able to care for everyone in the way they normally would, insisting that everyone will do their very best across the organisation to help and support staff to do their best.Ms Patterson added: ldquoWe want to thank those people who have complied with all the guidance. There are many people who have been very good, especially those who are vulnerable and face challenging conditions. What we now need is for more people to follow public health advice to help stop the spread of the virus.Mr Charlie Martyn, the health trustrsquos medical director, said people needed to do more to contain the virus.ldquoWe have all seen people out walking, congregating and meeting up. What we are seeing now around the mixing that has occurred and people meeting over Christmas and New Year is pressures on the wider health system, he said.ldquoWe all need to do better as iniduals and ask people to look at their inidual and collective compliance because we need to get out of this. None of us has faced this situation before. We will do the best we can when patients come into us, buttoo many people come in and there is too big a demand then that poses dficult questions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Brian.jpg","title":"Brian raises £1%2C250 with charity reindeer and book  ","story":"A LOCAL man has raised pound, for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.Brian Johnston, who lives near Temple, raised the money through the sales of his hand-crafted wooden reindeer and the proceeds of his humour-filled book.Brian Johnston, who recently handed over the money to the charity, says he is overwhelmed by the generosity of many people.Brian has been making his reindeer in the run-up to Christmas for the past five years.Sales in  far outstripped those in previous years, causing Brian to joke that over  reindeer have now found pastures new.Brianrsquos book of humour was also a popular Christmas present for many and sales of the books added to the total raised.

This will be a relief to them though a disappointment that the GCSE English and Maths modules scheduled for January  and  were cancelled at such short notice.However, he warned that the mistakes from last summer when controversial A-Level grades had to be amended must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoMany of the dficulties experienced in the summer of  must be avoided and the lessons learned used to inform the way ahead.ldquoWe have to resist the use algorithms to calculate inidual pupil results and awarding bodies must trust teacher professionalism coupled with rigorous checks and balances put in place by school leaders to ensure consistency.Down High School principal Mrs Maud Perry said: ldquoPupils are fully engaged in remote learning. Education is so much more than preparation for an exam and pupils will need to be well equipped for their next steps.She said that a DENI circular on remote learning was also received by schools last week which draws together key learning points from the last period of lockdown.Mrs Perry added: ldquoIt was reassuring to read that research confirms that we are on the correct path. The effectiveness of remote teaching is determined by the same factors as effective live classroom teaching. Keeping in touch is so important for pupil wellbeing.Mr Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, said he was relieved that the ldquoinevitable decision to cancel GCSEs and A Levels had been been made.ldquoWe now await guidance as to how grades will be awarded this year, he remarked.ldquoWhen this information is received it will give staff, students, and parents clarity as to the way forward for schools to see us safely through the rest of this academic year, he added.Ms Jenner King, vice principal of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, described the decision as ldquosensible, but said she was disappointed it had not been made sooner.ldquoThe main premise for all examinations is fairness and with the number of pupils missing out because of Covid-related absences, running the examinations as standard was never going to be fair, she saidldquoOur staff and pupils have been preparing and working hard towards this eventuality, and our hope now is that the Minister and CCEA act swtly to issue detail on the alternative. Any further delay will only serve to disadvantage our young people even further.Pupils from a number of schools also commented on Mr Weirrsquos announcement.Down High Head Boy Jack Martin, who is from Newcastle, said: ldquoI will be missing at least  weeks of in-school learning this school year alone in addition to the time missed from March last year.ldquoI know many have missed much more. Thus, I agree with the decision to cancel exams as some pupils have been disproportionally disadvantaged.Down High Head Girl Anna Clements, who is from Ballynahinch, said: ldquoI greatly appreciate what the teachers have been going through in these dficult times and I hope this decision eases the pressure on them.ldquoWe have been in a state of limbo since the start of our Upper Sixth Year. What I would appreciate now from external agencies is clarication with regard to how our grades are to be assigned.Assumption Grammar Head Girl Lucia Orsi, from Crossgar, said: ldquoI am relieved that examinations have been cancelled as I feared that our courses would not have been completed in time, due to the current lockdown.ldquoHowever, I am anxious that there has been no decision on how our grades will be calculated..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Towns.jpg","title":"Towns could be in line for public realm scheme boost  ","story":"SAINTFIELD, Killyleagh and Castlewellan could be in line for ambitious new public realm and environmental improvement schemes.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is seeking financial support from the Department for Communities to carry out work in each of the locations which could cost several million pounds.Traditionally, the government department provides cash to upgrade towns which have a population in excess of , people, but local authority officials believe that there may be a future opportunity to finance schemes in towns where the population is greater than ,.Members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were told on Mondaythat council officials plan to ask the government department to include the local areas in a capital works forward plan.Councillors were told that in order to inform the capital works forward plan, the council commissioned research in each of the areas, asking people for their views and coming up with short, medium and long term proposals.Reports on the future vision for each area were tabled at Mondayrsquos committee meeting and in addition to detailing what work could take place, they focus on the negative impact of doing nothing.Moving forward, council officials have confirmed that they are to work with their Department for Communities colleagues on a capital works programme for each area.In Killyleagh, suggested improvements include enhancements and improvements to the seafront between Seaview and Cuan Beach, new lighting between Shore Street and Seaview and a new slipway at Seaside Road.Other suggestions include improving the Sir Hans Sloane memorial space and Frederick Street car park and replacing a current public toilet block at the top of High Street in front of Killyleagh Castle,Elsewhere, repainting the townrsquos library is suggested, alongside utilising the top floor of the building for community use, addressing derelict buildings and the introduction of a so-called shopfronts scheme.The recent consultation highlighted the need for improved welcome and directional signage, new pavings and footpaths and support for the Hans Sloane Centre.Similarly in Saintfield there is a focus on upgrading shop fronts alongside new paving and footpaths, resurfacing a section of Main Street, addressing the derelict buildings issue and the provision of a pelican crossing between High Street and the townrsquos new community centre.Additional open spaces are also highlighted with calls for the main car park at Downpatrick Street to be upgraded, alongside the provision of additional spaces.The upgrade of public toilets at the New Line is also highlighted, alongside their potential relocation and steps to tackle a flooding issue between the Fair Green and Main Street.Other suggestions include the need for a ldquospend local campaign which could include the development of a mobile app, allowing shoppers to upload a personal spending balance which could attract discounts when purchases are made in the town.In Castlewellan, issues highlighted include better use of the space around the townrsquos market House at Upper Square, the provision of additional litter bins, better use of vacant and derelict space, enhanced car parking and traffic management and the townrsquos general landscape with flower beds and new trees, particularly at the Lower Square area.Improving signage to direct people to the peace maze at Castlewellan Forest Park and other buildings of interest is suggested..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12223489.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

A spokesperson said: Due to the very high levels of COVID- transmission across our community, the four UK Chief Medical Officers have advised that we now move into alert level , which requires the strictest of social distancing given the threat that health and social care services could become overwhelmed and therefore impacts on visiting to all care settings across Northern Ireland. Subsequently the Western Health and Social Care Trust have assessed all elements of risk and in order to protect patients, visitors and staff, the decision has been made to temporarily suspend visiting on all sites and facilities within the Western Trust. This suspension will now apply from midnight on Thursday, January . While we recognise that restriction to visiting is a very emotive and dficult issue, often causing distress for families, patients and residents, it is essential that these updated visiting restrictions are effectively applied to help bring the transmission of COVID- under control. There will becertain exceptional circumstances which will continue to apply. If you are permitted to visit hospital or a care facility under any of the special circumstances above you MUST wear a face covering, thoroughly wash your hands or use sanitiser when entering and exiting that facility. PLEASE DO NOT visityou are feeling unwell, especiallyyou have a high temperature or new persistent cough or have a sudden loss of taste or smell, the spokesperson continued. Children are not permitted to visit. The Trust acknowledges that this is a very dficult time for the public and we ask you to work with us and appeal to patients and visitors to respect our staff and the guidance they give you at all times. The Trust operates a ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy and we will not accept any form of abuse towards our staff. You can also continue to arrange a ‘virtual visit’ with your relative or friend on a smartphone or tablet. Our hospitals have access to free Wi-Fi and our staff can help set this up. Please be patient. Our staff will have to prioritise clinical work and patient care. We are very sorry to have to move to this position of suspending visiting to all our hospitals and facilities as we understand how important this is for people, but we must immediately apply this in the best interest of the health and safety for everyone until such time as the transmission of COVID- reduces. The Trust said the guidance will be kept under constant review. A breakdown of all exceptional circumstances included as part of the temporary suspension of visiting to Western Trust facilities is available to view on the Trust website.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abdbbbdadd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fddaccefac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1610724467795.jpg--coronavirus_15th_jan.jpg?161072446700","title":"covid  today s figures ","story":"Coronavirus th January .
