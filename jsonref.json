I guess I’m wanting emotional reassurance, but it’s way too early for that.One evening at dinner, over a glass of wine, I ask him a silly, girly question — and as soon as it’s out of my mouth, I regret it. ‘How do you feel about “us”?’John responds in an honest, male way: ‘Let’s take this slowly. I don’t want to be hurt again. Losing Bonnie has devastated me. I never want to go through that pain again. Not letting myself fall in love too quickly is the best way to protect myself.’I wasn’t expecting this response. I’ve been naïve, I realise, to assume we have much more than this. Outside the restaurant, John puts his arm around me and whispers: ‘Let’s just live in the now and take one day at a time.’But it’s no good — as the days in Greece pass, our relationship becomes decidedly chilly.On the Greek mainland, we visit Delphi, site of the ancient Oracle which could apparently predict the future. According to custom, people make a wish at the shrine — and mine is: ‘I hope my friendship with John will continue.’It isn’t until a year later that I discover what John has wished: ‘I want to live with my darling Nula until the end of my life.’When we return from Greece, I rush to see James. I kneel in front of his chair, take his hands in mine, and tell him I love him. He smiles. But when I wrap my arms around him, his body is unresponsive.John has been moving into a new flat. Understandably, he’s filled it with Bonnie’s Portmeirion china, her lamps and vases, photos of her in her youth. There’s even a plaque that says: ‘Bonnie’s Kitchen.’ I want to run away. I probably should. But the awful fear of facing dementia alone compels me to stay.The strange thing is that I feel like a mistress. I’m having a relationship with someone who, while not living with his wife, still sees her as very much a part of his life. And I feel I cannot come anywhere close to her perfection.With my emotions in turmoil, I tell John I’ve made up my mind that we should stop seeing each other. ‘I feel I’m treading on Bonnie’s past,’ I tell him.He is stunned. ‘You’re right! I just didn’t think!’ he says. ‘You saved me, we’ve saved each other. I want you in my life every second, every minute — no matter what . . . I love you very much and want you in my life forever.’We cry and hug I agree to stay. Days later, he dismantles the shrine, leaving two photos of me with James and him with Bonnie.         In the end, the bastard dementia takes James on the only day I go home to get some rest. Over the phone, a nurse tells me gently: ‘Sometimes they don’t want you there. Maybe your not being there allowed him to leave\u0027By the end of 2013, our relationship has moved into a better and more secure place.We have met each other’s families. Old friends have ‘celebrated our luck’ at finding each other.John and I talk about how strange it is that we continue to care for two people who haven’t acknowledged either one of us for nearly ten years. It’s also becoming clear that neither of our spouses have enjoyment left in anything. Not long afterwards, I notice that James’s swallowing reflex is going. I wish I had the courage to put a pillow over his head. Society is kinder to sick animals.Then one day, I’m sitting next to James’s bed, gripping his hands when I notice he’s holding my gaze. We’ve connected. I’m sure of it. Oh my God, I can’t believe it!It brings back something I heard as a child growing up in rural Ireland: that when someone is near to death, they get a momentary awareness. Can it be true?I scrabble in my handbag for my earphones, and put them into James’s ears. The music is by Mozart, his favourite composer he’s even written a six-part TV series about him. He reacts immediately, his eyes filling tears that slowly trickle down his cheeks. For the first time in years, we are united — by the music. I hug him over and over and kiss away his tears.Some days later, I’m shopping in a supermarket when I get the call: ‘Come as soon as you can. James isn’t going to make it.’When I arrive at the care home, he’s shaking violently. I ask the doctor to do something, please, to ease his suffering, but he looks at me, aghast. ‘Are you asking me to murder him?’I stay with James for several days and nights, and he lingers. John tries to ‘be there’ for me, but I refuse his efforts to console me.One night, he takes me out to dinner, knowing I’ve hardly eaten anything for the past week. I pick at the meal, but the food is like sawdust in my mouth. I can’t even keep up a conversation. John is upset. Back home, we ignore each other for the rest of the evening. Later, he tries to talk to me. ‘We’re in this together, Nuli.Whatever happens to James or Bonnie — when it’s their turn to go — we’ll be there to comfort and love each other through it.’I’m not sure I can do this: love in the present when I’m grieving for my past with James. But John is insistent and holds me tight. ‘Please, please don’t push me away. Don’t let bloody dementia win!’I start raving like a lunatic: ‘It’s already won. We’re unable to give James and Bonnie any words of comfort. We can’t even say goodbye — and as for us, it’s smashing us, too.’For the next few weeks, I don’t leave James’s bedside. He’s going through a nightmare cycle of crisis after crisis. As death creeps closer, I can’t sleep. I stroke his hair and tell him how much I love him and will never stop loving him.In the end, the bastard dementia takes James on the only day I go home to get some rest. Over the phone, a nurse tells me gently: ‘Sometimes they don’t want you there. Maybe your not being there allowed him to leave.’James is still in his room when I return. I lie on his body, nuzzling his face and howling. When the undertaker comes, I’m incapable of saying goodbye.Five months later, it’s Bonnie’s time to go. So soon after losing James, it’s hard reliving the emotions. At Bonnie’s funeral, John and I break down at the sight of her coffin and hug each other.The closing song is Joan Baez’s Farewell Angelina — a much-loved favourite of Bonnie’s — and strangely the first LP I ever bought as a student.It strikes me that this gives me a connection to her even after death.In the weeks that follow, I’m hit by a tsunami of sadness. I cry for days, replaying all the happy times, chats, and journeys I shared with James. I want to run far away from John and all the reminders of dementia.A month after Bonnie’s funeral, I decide our relationship is over. Dementia brought us together, but there’s now no need for us to continue.John agrees: Our relationship has run its course. Over the weeks, however, he texts and emails me — nothing intimate, just everyday chat. Then he remembers we have an appointment at the Apple Store to sort my computer out.He says we shouldn’t let it go — we had to wait long enough to get it — so we meet up again. We have lunch afterwards in Covent Garden. I look at him across the table. How could I think of leaving this man? We’ve shared so much pain and sadness. Our lives are intertwined.Surely it was OK to begin a new journey with him? I love John, for Christ’s sake.After lunch, we get a rickshaw ride and laugh at the craziness of it all, and embrace for the first time in weeks.For weeks, the ashes of Bonnie and James lie beside each other in John’s flat. In a way, it’s a huge comfort to have the four of us together. We include them in our conversations. They will always be part of our lives and we will never, ever forget them.In 2016, John and I decide on a break in India. As we settle into our flight, he turns to me, smiling. ‘I have something to ask you. Will you marry me?’My eyes fill with tears. A passing stewardess asks: ‘Are you OK?’ John laughs: ‘I’ve just proposed to her. She said yes.’ The stewardess returns with two glasses of champagne.We marry on July 7, 2016. That September, John has a new book published — Mozart: The Man Revealed. He dedicates it to ‘Mozart lover James Black’.Adapted by Corinna Honan from The Longest Farewell by Nula Suchet (Seren Books, £12.99). © Nula Suchet. To order a copy for £10.40 call 0844 571 0640.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First, a surprising reading experience for BMacLean:Over the past year or so, I’ve been reading on and off an Oxford paperback collection of Mallarmé’s poems. After not having looked at it the last few months, I picked it up again about a week ago and continued from where’d I’d left off.Much to my surprise, I found the poems in this middle section of the book noticeably more straightforward and easy to follow compared to my previous experience with this poet, notoriously oblique and difficult to interpret. “He must have drastically changed his approach to writing after a certain point in his life,” I thought, “Or no, wait - I must be getting smarter!”Much pleased and encouraged, I carried on with renewed enthusiasm. It wasn’t until a few days later that I noticed I wasn’t reading Mallarmé at all – it was an Oxford paperback Verlaine with a similar cover.The Past by Tessa Hadley has provoked lonelybloomer to ask some difficult questions:What can be as good as The Past by Tessa Hadley? I love a novel where a bunch of people have gathered in a remote home to vacation for a month or so, and to stir some old pains and quarrels. Can anyone recall this plot, done as nicely as Hadley’s book?Wow. A cross between Elmore Leonard and Neil Gaiman. Can’t quite believe she’s South African, by which I mean her grasp of US reality (Detroit), her rendering of the speech rhythms is pitch perfect.Vassily Grossman’s Life and Fate has impressed Bloreheath:A really great novel, in the classic Russian mould. One thing, among many, Russian writers could do was somehow to lend importance to persons who may initially seem perfectly ordinary — which may indeed mean most of us. No gimmicks here, none of what Angus Wilson called “the high jinks of experimentalism”, just wonderful straight writing.Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald has received a gold start from safereturndoubtful:Set in 1962 in Battersea Reach on the Thames the story is of the residents of permanently moored boats, considered by house dwellers then as being somewhat strange. The focus is on Nenna and her two daughters as she considers the future for her and the girls estranged from her husband and the children not attending school. She confides in Maurice, another boat-dweller, also male prostitute and storer of stolen goods. I’ve a favourite few pages when the Austrian boy, Heinrich, visits. A novella with a huge amount crammed in, Fitzgerald’s character development sneaks up on you, so much so that after only a few pages you feel you know the boat folk well. There’s occasional bursts of humour, that are even better appreciated when re-read, and an abrupt ending that may not surprise, but is extremely rewarding.A View From The Foothills by Chris Mullin has provided good bedtime reading for greenmill:It’s late 1999 and Mullin is a junior minister in John Prescott’s environment etc department. Mullin’s deadpan, self-deprecating humour is a delight. He is also generous to others (even some Tories) and is warming to Prescott despite his boss’s complete lack of management skills as he glimpses the fundamentally decent human being which lurks beneath the motor-mouth exterior. He quotes Simon Hoggart in the  reporting on a Prescott speech at that year’s Labour Party Conference “he announced the creation of two new National Parks in the way you might announce the annexation of the Sudetenland”.And pubbore “finally” got round to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury:Absolutely brilliant and scarily prescient of course, but I’m more affected by Bradbury’s afterword: ‘the fire chief in mid-novel says it all, predicting the one-minute TV commercial with three images per second and no respite from the bombardment. Listen to him, know what he says, then go sit with your child, open a book and turn the page.’If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

But major companies have started to abandon it and set up their own in-house imitations – threatening the very idea of fair trade. It wasn’t very long ago that a banana was just a banana – just a curved, yellow fruit. All you knew, if you bought a bunch in 1986, was that they cost around 97p per kilo. You weren’t told if they were organic or pesticide-free. You didn’t know if they came from Costa Rica or the Dominican Republic. And you certainly weren’t invited to worry about the farmers who grew them – or if their children went to school, or whether their villages had clinics. You just picked up your bananas and walked to the next aisle for your coffee or tea or chocolate, none the wiser about where they came from either, or about the people who farmed them.Back then, the countries that grew these commodities and many others were still known as the Third World, and the habit of not caring about their farming conditions was a legacy of their colonial past. For centuries, trade propelled the colonial project, and exploitation was its very purpose. The farmers of Asia, Africa and South America were forced to raise the crops that the empire’s companies wanted, to work the crops in abject conditions, and to part with them at ruinously low prices. In the last century, the empires melted away but the trade remained lopsided – with the imbalance now rationalised by the market, which deemed it “efficient” to pay farmers as little as possible. In the 1970s, a Ghanaian cocoa farmer often received less than 10 cents out of every dollar his beans earned on the commodities market as a proportion of the retail price of a chocolate bar, his take was smaller still. Child labour was common. The chocolate companies prospered and their customers shopped well the farmers stayed poor.Then, in the late 1980s, you began to hear more about these farmers, encountering their stories on television or in newspapers or even on the labels of the packages you bought. The reasons were manifold. Environmental awareness was on the rise. The prices of some commodities were crashing, placing agricultural incomes in even more acute peril than usual. There had already been small groups pushing for more equitable trade: “little do-good shops scattered in cities around Europe, selling products … bought at fair prices directly from small producers abroad”, as one pioneer described it. By the early 1990s, these disparate initiatives began to coalesce into a larger international struggle to radically reform our relationship with what we bought. Trade had long been unfair by design, but now there was a growing movement to make consumers care about that unfairness, and even to help rectify it.The crown jewel of this movement was Fairtrade International, an umbrella body formed in 1997 out of various national chapters that had sprouted over the previous decade. Fairtrade was founded on the conviction that consumers could make the marketplace more moral. The spine of Fairtrade’s philosophy has always been price: simple, clean, the kind of measure that economists like to deal with. If companies pay farmers equitably, Fairtrade believes, other benefits cascade out as well. Farmers can hire adult workers, rather than employing children they can send their kids to school, and buy medicines they can improve the yields of their farms by using better fertilisers. Producers must meet a number of standards to qualify for Fairtrade: rules about labour conditions, for instance, or waste disposal. But for companies, the totality of their ethical responsibilities towards their producers is encapsulated by price.So Fairtrade works by forming a kind of “virtuous triangle” of ethical business. It recruits farmers and farming cooperatives as members, asking them to meet its standards periodically, Fairtrade sends inspectors to these farms around the world, ensuring they are still compliant. At another vertex of the triangle, Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price, always set above market price, for commodities from these member farms, and offers to certify products made from such ethically sourced commodities. The final corner is the customer, who can, with a little counsel, be galvanised to shop consciously, and to buy Fairtrade-certified products even if they cost a few pence more.But its two real triumphs are in the realm of ideas, not numbers. First, and most obviously, Fairtrade challenged the entrenched model of the commodities business – the belief that a farmer’s lean income was just an unavoidable reality of trade economics. Second, somewhat more stealthily, it cemented the notion that the modern corporation would be ethical if only someone held up a lamp and showed it the way. Capitalism didn’t have to be feared the market would figure out its own checks and balances, through labelling agencies such as Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance, without having to be regulated by any higher authority. Persistent and egregious inequality could be solved by deft pleats and tucks to the garb of trade, rather than by a full reconsideration of its fabric and seams.Now, though, Fairtrade’s success in helping to build a world of heightened expectations of sustainability is perversely paving the way to its own demise. Companies are losing faith in labels such as Fairtrade – losing faith in their ability to secure the future of farming and the future of commodities that drive corporate profit, but also losing faith that these independent stamps of sustainability carry any value at all any more. Instead, the world’s giant food multinationals are taking matters into their own hands – setting up their own in-house certification programmes, appraising their own ethics to their own satisfaction.Although the fate of Fairtrade is not necessarily the fate of fair trade, the former has kept the latter alive as an object of aspiration. A weakened Fairtrade portends the enfeebling of the very idea of fair trade. This poses a serious problem, because Fairtrade relies on companies to constitute one half of its virtuous bazaar. Without the buyers, the Fairtrade bazaar folds up, and companies return to their own devices, to pursue only what’s best for themselves. Increasingly, companies are finding it easier and more expedient to produce their own certifications, said Trishna Shah, a Euromonitor analyst who tracks ethical labels: “A big change is happening.”The single most damaging blow to Fairtrade came two summers ago, and it was delivered by Sainsbury’s, which once proudly boasted that it was the world’s largest retailer of Fairtrade products. In May 2017, without any warning, Sainsbury’s broke the news that it would stop selling Fairtrade tea.“It was a bombshell,” Paul Tiony said. He had travelled to Nairobi that month, from his tea farm in Nandi Hills, in western Kenya, to take part in a half-day workshop run by Fairtrade Africa. Other tea farmers, from Malawi, Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda, were there as well, at the Pride Westlands hotel so was a team from Sainsbury’s. The company called a meeting at the end of the workshop, and Tiony grew excited. Sainsbury’s must have some kind of good news, he thought. But after gathering almost 50 workshop participants in a conference room of the hotel, Sainsbury’s revealed that its in-house tea brands were abandoning Fairtrade. Instead, an executive said, it was piloting its own ethical label – and calling it “Fairly Traded”. Later, Fairtrade estimated that these changes would affect nearly 250,000 farmers and workers.Among these were the 8,000 members of Sireet, the tea-farming cooperative to which Tiony belongs. Sireet’s produce is certified by Fairtrade, and Sainsbury’s used to be, by far, the largest buyer of Sireet’s Fairtrade tea. So Tiony was dumbstruck at the shock announcement. “Even Fairtrade Africa officials didn’t seem to know much about it,” he recalled. “They were asking: ‘Why are you doing this?’” Someone inquired: “Are you moving out of Fairtrade because of Brexit?”Sainsbury’s had no real answers, Tiony said – but it seemed to be doubting that Fairtrade was working as promised. One Sainsbury’s executive singled out one of the central principles of Fairtrade’s model: the so-called “premium” above the minimum price that companies must pay, and which cooperatives must use to build schools, or run clinics, or improve their communities in other ways. Sainsbury’s was concerned that the premium was being poorly used, and that it was money wasted. “But just a few days earlier,” Tiony said, “someone from Sainsbury’s had come to look at all our projects.” The farmers tried to argue with the executives the executives insisted they weren’t going to change their minds. “The meeting ended just like that.” The announcement kicked off an immediate storm. In an open letter, Fairtrade’s tea producers in Africa accused Sainsbury’s of seeking “power and control” over farmers in a manner “reminiscent of colonial rule”. A coalition of British non-profits urged consumers into a weekend of action under the rubric: “Don’t Ditch Fairtrade”. Buy a pack of “Fairly Traded” tea and then give it back, they suggested: “Let the sales assistant know you are returning it because it’s not Fairtrade.” In Parliament, MPs pressed Sainsbury’s to reconsider one accused the company of lying, and another complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the name Fairly Traded would mislead shoppers who confused it for Fairtrade. (Sainsbury’s declined to comment for this story. “The launch of Fairly Traded was a bit of a disaster,” a former executive told me with a sigh.)The Fairly Traded experiment ignited fears of a full orce, in which Sainsbury’s would abandon the rest of its Fairtrade products – its coffee and sugar its flowers the 650m bananas it sells every year – and move out of the Fairtrade house altogether. That would, the  wrote at the time, bring Fairtrade “crashing down”. So far, this hasn’t happened, but Sainsbury’s is still only a couple of years into its experiment with Fairly Traded. The orce could still come.All these firms still have a few products that are certified by third parties – by Fairtrade, or by other agencies such as Rainforest Alliance or UTZ. (The latter two merged in January 2018.) But the ratio is dwindling. The great energies of these corporations, said Trishna Shah, the Euromonitor analyst, are being lavished upon their own, bespoke schemes – each with its own little logo, its own definition of fairness, its own explanatory literature on a web page somewhere.For shoppers, this promises bewildering times ahead at the supermarket: more and more instances of what people in the industry call “label fatigue”. The shelves already crawl with sustainability logos: more than 460 of them on food and beverage packages, and a third of them created over the last 15 years. There are little chromatic decals to testify that tuna is dolphin-friendly that coffee is bird-friendly that “wild-collected natural ingredients” are up to FairWild standards that a slice of salmon is Salmon-Safe and follows Best Aquaculture Practices that a bottle of wine is LIVE, which means that it fulfills Low Input Viticulture and Ecology benchmarks. One logo promises a carbon-free product, another a carbon-neutral one, and a third a carbon-reducing one. The more labels there are, the less we know about them – about what they stand for, and about how meaningful they are.In a crowd, there’s room to hide. When Fairtrade began, labels were rare and precious things when you bought a product with a label on it, you knew what you were getting. In contrast, a company today can launch its certification logo into the large ocean of labels, confident that most shoppers will not know what the logo guarantees, but that it will nonetheless salve their consciences. “I think companies are hoping that label fatigue is an enduring trend,” said Elizabeth Bennett, a political economist who co-edited the Handbook of Research on Fair Trade. “They’re hoping that consumers are tired of learning what 30 different labels in one sector mean, and that we’ll all just think: ‘Any claim of sustainability is an improvement over no claim.’” This makes it easy for companies to resort to the ruse of “greenwashing” – pretending to be ethical without really being anything of the sort.Several people in the corporate world offered an even more depressing version of this story: companies are sidling away from third-party certifiers because their optimistic project – the idea that the market can be heedful of its own abuses and correct itself – has, in a grand sense, failed. After decades of work, these certifiers have been unable to truly alter the imbalance in global trade they have struggled to protect farmers, or to arm them for their various social, economic and environmental battles.The proof is in the dire projections for the future of farming, showing how vanishing agricultural bioersity, the warming climate and the ageing and impoverishment of farmers are all endangering the world’s crops – which means they are also endangering the supply chains of companies who rely upon farmers in Asia, Africa and Latin America to manufacture chocolate bars, coffee pods, or cotton T-shirts. By launching all these in-house programmes, companies are trying to take matters into their own hands – if only to secure their sources of commodities, and their bottom lines.The Fairtrade movement was born in 1988, when a Dutch non-profit introduced the first certification for ethically traded coffee. The label was named Max Havelaar, after a seminal anti-colonial novel by the Dutch writer Eduard Dekker, published in 1860. In the novel, Dekker described how the Dutch in Indonesia, having made themselves “masters of the country”, compelled the Javanese farmer to grow sugar and coffee, instead of rice for his family. The government “punishes him if he sells what he has produced to any purchaser but itself and it fixes the price actually paid”, Dekker wrote. “And because the entire trade must produce profit, that profit cannot be got in any other way than by paying the Javanese just enough to keep him from starving.” Naming the label after the novel was a blunt acknowledgement of the straight line connecting colonial exploitation to corporate exploitation. When the label launched, three Dutch coffee brands signed on to source their beans from a farmers’ cooperative in Mexico, paying a rate above market price that was agreed to be fair. The following year, coffee prices crashed following a breakdown of trade talks: the cost of a pound of coffee on the commodities market fell to rates last seen in the 1930s. Coffee farmers faced ruin. The universe seemed to be emphasising the urgency of Max Havelaar’s mission.In the voluminous literature on its website, Fairtrade sets out the prices it calculates to be “fair”. As of mid-July, the minimum price for a metric tonne of cocoa beans was $2,000 for a kilo of bananas from Cameroon, €6.40 for 1,000 fresh coconuts from the Windward Islands, $112. But Fairtrade doesn’t stop with ensuring these minimum prices it also demands that producers be paid an extra premium – $11 for the Windward Islands coconuts, for instance – and that these premiums be spent to benefit the community.Fairtrade insists that producers make these investment decisions democratically, which means that farmers have to organise into collectives such as Sireet. There is an undeniable power in Fairtrade bringing these collectives to the negotiating table, said Pauline Tiffen, the editor of the Journal of Fair Trade. “The tea industry used to be so hierarchical until quite recently that it was like something out of Dickens,” she said. “And cocoa still felt like it was operating in the 18th century. Until 20 years ago, if you went to any big trade meetings on cocoa, you’d see no women, no people of colour.”The debate over whether Fairtrade’s systems truly transform the lives of farmers has raged for nearly all of Fairtrade’s lifetime. Its numbers, in relative terms, are still puny. The 1.66 million farmers in the Fairtrade network form a speck within the 2 billion or so people who make their living from agriculture. The sale value of Fairtrade’s products may add up to $9bn, but the global market for coffee alone is worth $200bn.Even the benefits that Fairtrade promises to deliver to farmers have been called into question. In 2014, Fairtrade entered into a public squabble with a team from Soas University of London, which had examined how well Fairtrade did in shrinking poverty in Ethiopia and Uganda. The study, funded by the British government, found that schoolchildren had worked on Fairtrade-certified farms. The researchers compared wages on Fairtrade-certified tea and coffee estates – always owned by smallholders, in keeping with Fairtrade’s belief in championing the small farmer – with wages on larger, uncertified plantations. Workers on the Fairtrade estates were paid less and often laboured in worse conditions, they concluded. Fairtrade called these “distorted comparisons” and rejected the researchers’ conclusions.The rupture between Sainsbury’s and Fairtrade over tea has become the most prominent case of a large company concluding that Fairtrade wasn’t quite cutting it any more. The details of that rupture convey why Sainsbury’s was dissatisfied with Fairtrade, but also why replacement corporate schemes such as Fairly Traded feel flimsy or stifling to those meant to benefit from them.Two people who have worked with Sainsbury’s told me that the company had been unhappy with Fairtrade for years. When I spoke to these anonymous sources in April, both sounded exasperated at the way Sainsbury’s had handled its exit, but they made the case that its reasons were sound. “We were paying these premiums, but it wasn’t clear where the money was going. Fairtrade isn’t good at keeping tabs on it,” one of them said. “It wasn’t always going to medicines and schools and things like that, as we found through our own investigations.”Other Fairtrade partners had raised this as well, she added. “We wanted more data … Instead, there was just a systemic inefficiency.” Sainsbury’s, as a corporation, was constantly pressured to be transparent, she said. “But it turned out that Fairtrade wasn’t quite as transparent. That was frustrating.” The other Sainsbury’s source confirmed this. “If you wanted to find out what a cooperative had done with a whole wad of Fairtrade premiums, or what the impact of that had been over the years, nobody could tell you. Or you’d get some anecdotal stuff.”A Fairtrade spokesperson told me, in response to these claims, that the organisation wanted farmers to spend their premiums the way they wished, setting their own goals and monitoring their own progress. She added that, since April, Fairtrade has “strengthened the requirements on Fairtrade premium use, management, and reporting, in order to promote best practices and increase transparency”. Now, if a cooperative’s annual premiums exceed $150,000, it must hire an external auditor to inspect the way it accounts for the money.Even as Sainsbury’s was stewing over the premiums it was paying out, the second Sainsbury’s source told me, it had begun to “rain down with standards” over the past decade. Companies and non-profits introduced a fleet of new labels and certifications, their names all seeming to blend hazily into each other. Pasture for Life. New Forest Marque. Food Made Good. Soil Association. Free Range Dairy Pasture Promise. LEAF Marque. “Then Fairtrade starts to look just like a sliver of the pie – an expensive and not very satisfactory one,” said the source. “And Sainsbury’s thinks: ‘I’m sure we can do this ourselves, I’m sure we know what needs to be delivered.’”Fairtrade didn’t think so. Under Fairly Traded, farmer collectives no longer receive their premiums directly, or decide how to spend this money. Instead, they must work on “action plans” and convince a Sainsbury’s board of experts in London to release their funds. In their open letter, Fairtrade’s tea producers protested that the company was characterising these premiums as “donor money” rather than earnings that rightfully belonged to the farmers. Fairtrade called the board “a further layer of bureaucracy controlled by a group far removed from day-to-day life in Africa”.It feels like a paradox: that, in a moment when sustainability and ethics are more important than ever, corporations want to desert an agency such as Fairtrade, the most famous certifying entity in the field. Companies are under pressure – from customers, governments, banks and investors – to prove their sustainability credentials. Signatories to the UN’s Principles of Responsible Investment now manage around $89tn in assets. The network of Sustainable Stock Exchanges – more than 80 bourses around the world – guide and sometimes even require listed companies to report on their sustainability.In a way, this dialled-up consciousness explains why companies are searching for alternatives to independent labelling systems, said Fredrik Galtung, who runs TrueFootprint, a firm that analyses data to tell businesses if their various sustainability projects make any sort of impact. He detects, in the industries he works with, a hardnosed sense that unsustainable practices will result in economic risk. So he isn’t surprised that companies, finding Fairtrade insufficient at tackling that risk, are rushing to erect their own standards. “If Fairtrade producers could show that their farmers were 10 or 20 years younger on average, that would be something. If they could show they’re more climate-resistant, that would be a massive advantage. But we’re unable to see all this.”Fairtrade denies that its future is dim, or that a schism has appeared between itself and the companies with which it aims to work. In his discussions of these issues, Dario Soto Abril, who has been the CEO of Fairtrade International since 2016, is a model of genial tact. He’s in an unenviable position. He must keep his relations with corporations warm Sainsbury’s still retails plenty of Fairtrade-labelled products, for example, and Mondelēz uses Fairtrade’s skills to track payments and commodities up and down the supply chain. At the same time, Soto must project his conviction that it is best for everyone concerned – shoppers, farmers, but especially companies – if they all commit fully to Fairtrade.The effects of climate change alone are “so accelerated”, Soto said, “that we think if nothing of significance is done by 2050, at least half the land under coffee production now will be lost, one way or another.”Last year, the UN released a map of the world predicting where yields were likely to drop or rise before 2050. In West Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, which have been plantation-farmed by colonists and then corporations, harvests will shrink. In North America and Europe, which have already cornered the profits of centuries of agribusiness, harvests will expand. The map is iniquity compounded upon iniquity.Soto insists Fairtrade is flourishing: “Our credibility remains high. We get new partners all the time.” Sales of Fairtrade-certified products have swelled year on year around the world, partly as a result of companies exploring new markets. On the other hand, farmers are entering Fairtrade at a slowing pace. Between 2015 and 2016, Fairtrade managed to bring 3,199 new workers into its network the previous year, it recruited 9,955.“It’s important to note that Fairtrade can’t solve everything,” Soto said. “We’re here trying to solve challenges as old as humanity. We need more committed partners. We need more innovative ideas.” But Soto is also forgiving of companies that have chosen to set up schemes to certify themselves. “I think companies are looking to test something new,” he said carefully. “We need to allow for that. I will never doubt that companies will do the best they can.”For the chief executive of an organisation founded on the premise that companies need to be cajoled or nagged into paying farmers a living income, this sounded like an astonishingly trusting statement. Soto’s most barbed opinion concerned farmer premiums and the larger issue of involving producers in decision-making. “I’m with you when you say that these companies aren’t giving farmers a seat at the table,” Soto told me. “You have to allow farmers a say in the income generated by sales. They have to own their premiums. That was our biggest suggestion to Sainsbury’s.”Last October, the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK acknowledged that, in the new era of self-certification, its function had to evolve. Since companies are setting up their own sustainability schemes, said Lord Mark Price, who chairs the Foundation’s board of trustees, “the role of Fairtrade is to help those organisations be the best they can be”. Fairtrade will still operate its certification programme the yin-yang logo will still be seen on products. But for Fairtrade to climb into the role of a consultancy – a supplier of guidance, rather than an umpire enforcing a line for companies to toe – is the most conclusive evidence yet of the transformation under way. And it raises two questions. How will companies behave if they have to testify only to their own code of ethical sourcing? And in what shape will that leave the future of agriculture?If the animating principle of Fairtrade is “price,” that of most corporate in-house programmes is “yield”. These programmes may differ in other details. Some are just two years old others were established more than a decade ago. Some pay their farmers Fairtrade-like minimum prices others do not. But they are united by their unwavering focus on yield – on squeezing more produce out of a hectare of land. They consider it the best way to protect and grow their supplies of coffee or tea or cocoa, and thus the best way to save agriculture.Mondelēz also does not set a minimum price. It pays “loyalty premiums” to the farmer collectives with which it chooses to work, and Cathy Pieters, director of Mondelēz’s Cocoa Life programme, said it was up to them to decide what kind of “action plans” can be funded with the money. She added, though, that Mondelēz commissions large NGOs to work with these cooperatives in determining and crafting these action plans. Once again, as with Sainsbury’s and its Fairly Traded programme, the premiums intended to benefit farmers aren’t quite wholly theirs to spend as they see fit.Fairtrade is half-owned by its producer cooperatives, so its standards and metrics are decided in large part by the representatives of farmers. The standards of Cocoa Life, CAFE Practices and other schemes aren’t like that they are written by the companies themselves, in the companies’ own best interests. No independent third party certifies their success or failure in meeting these standards and publishes those results. Companies reporting on their own sustainability frequently fail “to prioritise planet over profit”, Hans Hoogervorst, who heads the International Accounting Standards Board, said in a speech in April. “Greenwashing is rampant.”Industries are increasingly left to audit themselves, in part because governments have shredded their budgets in the name of austerity. From Volkswagen to Boeing, we don’t have to look very hard for evidence that companies fib and cheat when they get to mark their own homework. Bringing sustainability certification in-house is unlikely to empower farmers, or to renovate the structure of trade. “But it’s simplistic to say that companies will act in ways that are injurious to farmers,” said Fredrik Galtung of TrueFootprint, the sustainability analysts. In his view, the crises in agriculture are so stark that companies are motivated to protect farms and farm workers – if only to secure their own future profits. But TrueFootprint’s scorecards indicate that most companies only report their spending on sustainability almost none of them investigate the impact of these schemes on farmers or on natural resources like air and water. Galtung described it as “just being happy to check off boxes”.That lesson is available to students of the past as well. After the publication of Max Havelaar shocked the public, in 1901 the Dutch government formulated a new ethical policy – one that would treat Indonesia as a moral responsibility rather than simply as a territory to be exploited. Millions of guilders had flowed from these islands into the Dutch treasury – 187m between 1867 and 1878 alone – and so the government committed to spending 30m guilders over the first decade on the welfare of the Indies’ farmers. Not surprisingly, they received agricultural credit and irrigation canals, because the Dutch corporations were avid for better yields. They also gained more schools and more roads they were not, however, encouraged to industrialise, because this would have inflated the cost of local labour and led to competition with Dutch businesses.The Dutch ethical policy came undone as soon as the colonist’s aims started to clash with those of the colony. The harvests improved, but not enough to warrant the investment. The Great Depression set in, and the government thinned down its expenditures even as Indonesian farmers slid into debt. Educating the populace began to seem like a mistake there was no work for young Indonesian men who had attended university, and they inevitably drifted into the nationalist movement. By 1940, the government had ceased to fund the welfare projects.An unnamed administrator, who had once supported the ethical policy, watched with disappointment as the meagre progress unravelled and said: “As soon as we withdraw our hands, everything sinks back into the marsh.” But what the Dutch didn’t recognise was that they were the ones who made it impossible for the Indonesians to rise from the marsh in the first place.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a2ec8b4e34757527d16418a5b071d72e0da4ad/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e339762bcf20b7c55bd4d45e2d870cd2","title":"new uk nuclear plants government cost","story":"Government plans to attract investors by making taxpayer help pay for cost overrunsThe government has confirmed plans for consumers to begin paying for new nuclear reactors before they are built, and for taxpayers to pay a share of any cost overruns or construction delays.In a consultation document launched on Monday night, officials said the model is “essential” to attract private investors to back the UK’s new nuclear ambitions at a price that is affordable for bill payers. The public purse would also compensate nuclear investors if the project was scrapped.The new funding structure could be used to prop up EDF Energy’s £16bn plans for a new nuclear reactor at Sizewell B in Suffolk, which was left in doubt after fierce criticism of the costs surrounding the Hinkley Point C project in Somerset.It could also resurrect the dormant plans for a £16bn new nuclear reactor at the Wylfa project in North Wales, which fell apart last year due to the high costs of nuclear construction.The so-called “regulated asset base”, or RAB model, helps to make major infrastructure projects cheaper by shifting the risk of spiralling costs from the developer to the taxpayer.It is the same model used to fund London’s £4.2bn super-sewer project, the Thames Tideway Tunnel, which has drawn criticism for raising water bills while investors reap financial rewards.An EDF Energy spokesman said the model will lower the cost of financing nuclear plants, which will benefit consumers through their bills.The company added that Sizewell C will be cheaper to finance and build than Hinkley Point C because it is “a near replica” of its forerunner which is already being constructed on time and to budget.“It will benefit from the experience of Hinkley Point C’s engineers, contractors and suppliers and lessons from other nuclear projects, including operational EPR plants,” EDF Energy said.“It can also repeat the huge boost for industry, jobs and skills already happening due to Hinkley Point C’s construction, which is on schedule.”The energy industry will have until mid-October to respond to the plans before a final decision is made by ministers.Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: “The nuclear industry has gone in just 10 years from saying they need no subsidies to asking bill payers to fork out for expensive power plants that don’t even exist yet and may never.”“This ‘nuclear tax’ won’t lower energy bills – it will simply shift the liability for something going wrong from nuclear firms to consumers,” he added.Last summer, when the plans first emerged, the economist Dieter Helm, an influential government adviser, backed the RAB model as a better deal than the contract handed to EDF Energy to build the Hinkley Point project.But he added that it is “neither necessary or desirable to meet the twin objectives of security of supply and decarbonisation”.“No smart contracting and regulating framework can magic away the deep challenges that nuclear faces, notably: the possibility that in the next 60 years much cheaper new low carbon technologies may become available, possibly including new nuclear ones too the very large upfront and sunk costs the risk and the safety regulation and the challenges of getting rid of the waste,” he said.Tom Greatrex, head of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the plans are fundamental to the UK’s climate targets because they will help to reduce reliance on fossil fuels while maintaining a secure, reliable system of power generation.“This approach is already well established with investors in large infrastructure projects, and will reduce the cost to consumers as we replace our ageing fleet. Doing so is fundamental to meeting net zero, and we need to get on with it now,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39947967d35c92581b24e984c7eda4d1d5925da8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b0c8aa86ddf3863f035b19ca033e987","title":"the jungle metropolis how sprawling manaus is eating into the amazon","story":"Informal settlements are expanding, with a new occupation attempt every 11 days, and the threat to the rainforest is severeAntonio Pinto’s makeshift home on the outskirts of Manaus is an open-air shack, one of dozens of similar dwellings of timber and tarpaulin scattered around the hills.Around them is the evidence of the use of flame and iron: the hills are scorched and brown, littered with fallen logs and toppled, twisted trees.Pinto, 57, moved here earlier this year from an isolated Amazonian river town, 18 hours away by boat. He’s sick and needed to be closer to a hospital to get regular treatment.“I’m indio,” he said, meaning indigenous. “There’s a bunch of indigenous people here.”Not long ago, this area was covered in pristine Amazon rainforest and native shrubbery. In 2015, a group arrived and began clearing the land using chainsaws and fire. Today the settlement is known as Monte Horebe, and is home to about 5,000 people.It is the largest of dozens of shantytowns in this jungle metropolis, population 2 million. Dubbed “invasions”, these informal settlements are expanding outwards into the forest: in 2018 authorities identified a new occupation attempt every 11 days on average.“Manaus should be an example to the world of how man and nature can live together, but unfortunately that’s not the case,” said Marcos Castro, a professor at the Federal University of Amazonas.Critics say the clearances are also the result of a government failure to address a chronic shortage of affordable housing. As the economic powerhouse of the Brazilian Amazon, Manaus attracts thousands of migrants each year.Many of the poorest end up in informal housing such as Monte Horebe. According to the Manaus environment secretariat, at least 100 football pitch-sized patches of forest and vegetation have been destroyed to make space for squatters to build homes. Monte Horebe borders the Adolpho Ducke reserve, one of Brazil’s largest preserved urban forests.The trees are not the only concern, however, said the city’s environment secretary, Antonio Nelson de Oliveira. “Deforestation is, of course, bad, but it can be resolved by planting more trees. Cleaning polluted waters is a lot more complex,” he said.Untreated waste and rubbish from the occupations usually ends up in Manaus’s hundreds of igarapés – little rivers – that snake across the city. Today, all are polluted.“As a kid, I used to swim in the igarapés. That’s impossible now,” said the mayor, Arthur Virgilio Neto.Igarapés flow into the Rio Negro, the city’s main river and primary water supply. The smaller tributaries are important for maintaining healthy soils, and if blocked can lead to serious flooding during rainy seasons.Nevertheless, migration continues to increase, recently fed by new groups of Haitians and Venezuelans fleeing civil strife. Manaus is the capital of Amazonas state, a vast area more than five times the size of Germany that is home to the world’s largest remaining tropical forest reserves.In the interior towns, however, jobs are scarce and traditional ways of life such as fishing and family farming are becoming more difficult. Public services, schools and hospitals are often far away.But housing in Manaus proper is expensive and in scarce supply, leading many people to build their own informal accommodation on the forest’s edge.Sebastiana Cruz, 43, who works in a shopping mall, came here to escape expensive rent in 2015. She says the housing deficit feels unaddressed. “The mayor never visited,” she said. “Politicians only come when they want votes.”According to Brazil’s Institute of Geography and Statistics, Manaus needs an additional 128,000 homes. The deficit takes into account currently existing stock that is substandard or unaffordable, but also the need for more housing overall.“You could fix much of the irregular occupations problem by building more low-income housing,” said Virgilio Viana, CEO of the Sustainable Amazon Foundation.Complicating matters, local government authorities said occupations are typically led by organised crime groups. Monte Horebe is controlled by the city’s most powerful drug gang, the Northern Family, which was was recently accused of ordering a bloody prison massacre that killed dozens. The group controls large swathes of the city“Today, the force of the invasions is much stronger than the forces to protect against them,” De Oliveira said, arguing that security and combating crime should be first priority.Castro argued that the problems are symptomatic of successive government failures. “It’s easy to blame drug traffickers and poor people,” he said. “But this is a long-term problem.”Manaus itself was built largely informally. In the 1970s the city’s population began to swell with the opening of a free trade zone that was home to thousands of factory jobs.“But the government was unable to cope with the demand,” said Castro.He emphasised that while squatter communities like Monte Horebe indeed cause enormous environmental damage, luxury condominiums and factories also dump waste into rivers, and noted that the vast majority water in Manaus goes untreated.Many believe the situation can only get worse. One factor cited is a plan to reopen the dilapidated highway connecting the Manaus to Porto Velho. Currently, Manaus is mostly only accessible by plane or boat the 870km highway fell into disrepair decades ago. Now the authorities have signalled that they plan to reopen it, many fear Manaus’ migration and housing crisis will be aggravated, leading to more occupations.“The fact that Manaus is isolated kept people out to a certain extent,” said Philip Fearnside, an American biologist who has lived in Manaus since the 1970s.The extreme weather effects of the climate crisis are also only likely to exacerbate the environmental degradation, Viana pointed out.“It’s an extremely worrying scenario,” he said.Additional reporting by Fábio OliveiraFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0a23943b1efde3721d382ea2a25273b6855493/0_0_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=906f1ed16f7b3420b02384cb61b2d65a","title":"theme parks pubs and human zoos how the victorians invented leisure","story":"Entrepreneurs came up with increasingly elaborate ways to part Londoners from their money, inventing many staples of the modern leisure industry Whether it was visiting a “human zoo”, taking a bull on a hot-air balloon ride, or singing risqué songs about rhubarb, Victorian Londoners loved to have fun.As entrepreneurs and impresarios came up with increasingly elaborate ways to make money from the capital’s huge potential audience, Victorians effectively invented the modern leisure industry – including theme parks, pubs and professional football.As a new book by historian Lee Jackson explains, the hunt for profit took place against the backdrop of typical Victorian concerns surrounding morality, class and empire. So where did Victorians go for fun? And what still exists today?You probably won’t hear the music hall classic Pulling My Rhubarb Out at Wilton’s these days but this back-street Wapping theatre is one of the few Victorian music halls still standing. Wilton’s was built in 1859, as grand purpose-built music halls began to appear in London following changes in licensing laws. Crowds loved the mix of smutty and sentimental songs, as well as slapstick, circus performers and black face minstrels.InBy the 1860s, music halls were drawing crowds twice as large as the old West End theatres, whose owners launched various countermeasures – including downright duplicitous manipulation of licensing loopholes – to get their rivals closed down. Music halls were also accused of harbouring prostitutes or providing entertainment of a low moral and intellectual calibre, which is precisely what made them so popular.Over time, proprietors closed their bars and toned down the acts so that by 1912, music hall was deemed acceptable even for royalty. That’s when George V attended the Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre. At Wilton’s you can still see a mix of theatre, comedy and music – and there’s also a great bar.It’s now a building site near Leicester Square, but when the Argyll Rooms lost its licence in 1878, there was a riot. Drunken medical students were so incensed at the closure of their favourite haunt they took to the streets and, urged on by cheering prostitutes, hurled firecrackers at the police. That gives you an idea of the sort of crowd that used to frequent the Argyll Rooms, the West End’s premier and most dissolute dance hall.A dance craze hit London in the 1840s, and a number of dancing rooms – or casinos – were opened, including Laurent’s Casino off the Strand. This was London’s first night-club, and it later transferred to the Argyll Rooms on Shaftesbury Avenue, taking over a space that had previously been used as a museum, automaton show and indoor “centrifugal railway” – a primitive rollercoaster complete with loop-the-loop. The proprietor was Bob Bignell, a West End bookmaker, who saw money in the dancing trend. His club soon attracted crowds out for a good time – too much so for the authorities, leading to its eventual shutdown.The Argyll closed as the dance fad came to an end, and Bignell turned the space into the Trocadero music hall. It kept that name through the 20th century when it was transformed into one of London’s naffest tourist attractions. The site currently awaits development into a hotel.One of the most distinctive features of the handsome Prince Alfred pub in Maida Vale is the panelled iders which you have to duck under to move from bar to bar. These were installed to ensure different classes of customer had their own safe space – and class was a major concern for Victorian moral authorities, who worried that the new forms of mass entertainment were cutting across traditional boundaries.Sumptuous boozers like the Prince Alfred, rich with decorative wood and etched glass, were created to partly address the class issue by making gin-drinking itself respectable – but even then, the different classes needed to know their place.Temperance campaigners were not satisfied. They argued that it was precisely the gorgeousness of the gin palace – the gaslight and gilding, brass fixtures and fittings, large windows, etched glass and mirrors, not to mention the innovation of counter service – that lured more respectable members of the working-class into the sinful public house. Despite such concerns, these would all become standard features of the Victorian pub and remain the defining characteristics of the pubs we use today.A set of wrought iron gates by a riverside park are all that remain of the Cremorne, once one of the most notorious of London’s Victorian pleasure gardens. Stretching from the Kings Road to the Thames, it opened in 1843 and along with the gardens at Vauxhall, Highbury Barn, Walworth and Islington’s Eagle Tavern, catered for thousands of nightly visitors.The average pleasure garden had promenades, bandstands and follies, plus curious performers such as Michael Boai, who played music on his chin, or “the Beckwith frogs”, a family who ate breakfast in an underwater tank. There were elaborate firework displays, including Cremorne’s pyro-boosted pride-restoring recreations of the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. Another Victorian favourite was the novelty hot-air balloon ascent. At Cremorne, a balloonist called Madame Poitevin took to the air on the back of a bull. The balloon crashed in Ilford and the animal died of shock, causing the RSPCA to get involved.Cremorne was managed by a trio of West End publicans, and became identified with a fast set who would swan down to Chelsea after the theatres had closed, raising hell. Brawls were commonplace, and the gardens were popular with prostitutes and Londoners looking for fun. It closed in 1877, after losing its licence. Pleasure gardens more generally lost their raison d’etre with the establishment of public parks. London’s rapid growth meant the valuable land was usually sold to developers, which is why so little of London’s great pleasure gardens remain.Pleasure gardens were also overshadowed by larger exhibition grounds such as the Crystal Palace, which tried to find a way of balancing entertainment with a hard dose of cultural education. Little physically remains of the Crystal Palace itself, which moved to Sydenham from Hyde Park in 1854, but the grand 200-acre grounds still exist as a public park.The great glass building was used as a sort of showcase for luxury goods but also had zones with fine art, artefacts and historic architecture such as a Roman villa and 50-ft copies of the statues of Ramesses II in Abu Simbel. There were dioramas showing flora and fauna from around the world, complete with models of West Indians and Native Americans. The gardens hosted elaborate entertainments – a race featuring ponies ridden by monkeys was one highlight – as well as plays, operas and pantomimes. There was also a “human zoo” featuring 60 Somalis, transported from Africa to be gawped at by curious South London. The Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire in 1936 but its footprint remains, while you can get a sense of its somewhat haphazard educational ambition through the beloved stone statues of dinosaurs.Other exhibition grounds leant towards more straightforward fun: the Earl’s Court grounds were like a modern theme park, with Ferris wheel, rollercoaster and Buffalo Bill’s cowboy show, albeit with sideshows tailored towards an annual theme, often chosen to attract finance from commercial partners. This was partly the work of impresario Imre Kiralfy, who created fantastic theatrical displays at Kensington’s Olympia such as Venice In London, which combined canals and three-quarter scale gondolas with walkable streets and bridges and working restaurants and cafes. Kiralfy would later open White City, the epitome of the Victorian theme park’s promise to provide both “instruction and amusement”. White City had orientalist architecture, thrilling rides, human zoos (Irish this time) and pavilions sponsored by Moet \u0026amp Chandon all tied together with a thread of education that was increasingly hard to discern amid the ornamental canals and rickety roller-coasters.On the site of the Methodist Central Hall was a short-lived attraction that attempted to transport the seaside to central London. It was railways that made Margate and Southend accessible to Londoners, and some of the leisure activities peculiar to the seaside soon made it back to the capital.One of these was the winter garden, a sort of compact, centralised exhibition ground that day-trippers could visit when it rained. Southport opened the first in 1874 and the concept was transposed in full to Westminster in 1876.Southport’s winter garden offered a promenade through a large tropical conservatory, a basement aquarium complete with crocodiles, games rooms, a concert hall and landscaped gardens with caves, grottoes and ornamental bridges. A skating rink was later added. London’s version, the Royal Aquarium and Winter Garden, was a straight copy, crocodiles excepted. It flopped, and the site was levelled in 1903.Fulham FC, London’s oldest professional football club, still play at their first ground, built by the Victorians in 1896. The oldest parts of the ground are the pavilion and main stand, dating to 1905, and a sign of how popular and financially successful football had become under the Victorians. Although versions of the sport had been around for centuries, it was the Victorians who codified the game and then professionalised it. This led to enclosed grounds where spectators paid for admittance, with the income spent on acquiring new players. The modern game was born.London has many claims to football history. The first trial match under FA rules was played in 1863 at Limes Field, the former home of Barnes FC, since demolished. A second demonstration match took place in Battersea Park. London was also the location of the first FA Cup final, at Kennington Oval in 1872, while finals were also played at Crystal Palace and the since demolished Lillie Bridge in West Brompton.London’s oldest football ground? That’s the Old Spotted Dog in Forest Gate, a former cricket ground that has been home to non-league Clapton FC since 1888.Palaces of Pleasure by Lee Jackson is published by YaleFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3b3b240c93bfb371284f8a2379ad96589fde68/0_22_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c9a267f4ae8f88ab39c910abaf5aadf","title":"the guardian view of the new lib dem leader the vision thing","story":"To wrest the mantle of progressive change from other rivals in Westminster will need Jo Swinson to find her voice and a new set of attractive policies beyond BrexitJo Swinson arrives at probably the best time to be a Liberal Democrat for a decade. In May the party posted a record European election result, attracting both Labour and Conservative voters disaffected by their own parties’ isions over Brexit. A few weeks earlier local elections saw the party gain hundreds of seats and control of a series of councils in England. The party hovers near the top of the polls. Ms Swinson’s job will be to keep it there.This has been a remarkable turnaround. In 2015, as the Oxford academic Tudor Jones notes in his forthcoming book The Uneven Path of British Liberalism, the Lib Dems suffered an electoral collapse as great as the two great vanishings that the Liberal party managed in the 20th century. What almost finished the Lib Dems off was not just their hand in austerity, but the party’s perceived political irrelevance in the minds of a majority of British voters. If history was any guide, the road back to significance would have been a long one.Yet the first female leader of the Lib Dems will have the wind in her sails – thanks in large part to the party’s implacable opposition to Brexit. One poll suggests the party will capture Brecon and Radnorshire in a byelection, helped by other remain parties standing down. If the alliance was replicated across the country, experts suggest, possibly 150 seats could be won. That of course depends on how Labour calibrates its response to Brexit. The Lib Dems’ strength is that they chose early on to oppose it in stark terms. Not only did this put the party back on the map, it also reminded the public about its traditions the Liberal party was the first political party to declare public support for British membership of what was then the European Economic Community.Whatever the pretensions to be the next prime minister, the new Lib Dem leader will lead just 11 MPs in parliament – making it the fourth force in Westminster party politics. While they lack the parliamentary machinery of the big two parties, the Lib Dems must strive to play a part in moulding the future. This will mean they will have to work out how to be more than just a protest vote against Labour and the Conservatives, at a time when populism is in the ascendancy. Ms Swinson could do worse than follow in the social liberal tradition of Beveridge and Keynes. There is room in UK politics for a party that combines social democratic economics and an uncompromising anti-Brexit message with a strong commitment to constitutional reform, environmentalism and civil liberties.It is true that liberal ideas across Europe are being tested by the politics of fear. But the Lib Dems must find convincing answers to the questions about how societies can manage inequality, champion immigration and defuse nationalism’s incipient threat. So far, apart from the party’s Brexit message, the Lib Dems have largely offered an unadventurous and conservative response to the gravity of the problems afflicting the nation. While the policy message will need to be honed, Ms Swinson will also have to prove that she can be an effective communicator of the Lib Dems’ appeal as a positive choice in British politics.The sterility of our current politics may not last, though it is hard to see how it might end any time soon. What is up for grabs in politics is which party will be at the centre of progressive change in Britain. In terms of its parliamentary weight and policies, Labour has been the most effective vehicle for the fair and just transformation of Britain. For Ms Swinson to change that will require a stable base of voters and an attractive bedrock of principles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b983e3b8becc7992baaf1e01d56df66e8301c6bc/0_80_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574e7e6a56ecd4bab3495ea3a6e2262f","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of climb","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘climb’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘climb’.Share your photos of what climb means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 24 July at 10am.

We echo Ms Soueif’s call for the museum to take a clear position as an ally of coming generations.”Soueif outlined her reasons for resigning in a post on the London Review of Books website. “My resignation was not in protest at a single issue,” she wrote. “It was a cumulative response to the museum’s immovability on issues of critical concern to the people who should be its core constituency: the young and the less privileged.”She added that the “British Museum is not a good thing in and of itself” and is “good only to the extent that its influence in the world is for the good”.Soueif continued: “Will the museum use it to influence the future of the planet and its peoples? Or will it continue to project the power of colonial gain and corporate indemnity?”The museum’s chair of trustees, Sir Richard Lambert, responded by saying the resignation of a “valued and very supportive trustee for seven years” was unexpected and a “sad moment”.BP’s sponsorship of the arts in the UK has led to multiple resignations and protests by high-profile figures.Earlier this month, Antony Gormley, Rachel Whiteread, Anish Kapoor, Gillian Wearing and Mark Wallinger were among a group of about 80 artists who wrote to the National Portrait Gallery director, Nicholas Cullinan, to demand it end its relationship with BP.That followed Mark Rylance’s resignation from the Royal Shakespeare Company because of its sponsorship deal with the oil company, and Extinction Rebellion’s “die-in” protest outside the Royal Opera House over BP’s sponsorship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbc54cce1554bc133067afcad204290848f5f397/337_175_1081_648/master/1081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e3185d984e507ec59f3257e4ff41c5f","title":"four inspirational days in nova scotia","story":"South London artist and muralist Remi Rough finds visual inspiration in the region’s rocky landscapes, colourful villages and journeys on water … and captures it in a muralI’ll be completely honest the only thing I knew about Nova Scotia before I went was that rapper and hip-hop artist Buck 65 is from there! What I found was a completely charming province, and one that’s very erse, too, with so many different experiences you can have. You’ve got city life in Halifax, then sprawling national parks, and so much of life here is led on or by the water. I came here with the challenge of creating a mural on a building in Halifax, and I found so much inspiration along the way. The result was amazing – I left a little piece of myself on the harbour front.As there are year-round direct flights from London to Halifax and they only take six hours, you can get right into the Halifax swing of things without long transfers or bad jet lag. Spend your first morning walking along its historic harbour front to get a feel for the city. It has great cultural experiences where you can learn more about the region’s past, like the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. The Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum is particularly moving – while ship’s survivors went to New York, all who perished came to Halifax, and you can learn about their poignant personal stories here.One of the absolute gems of this region is the quaint, colourful village of Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site. Established in 1753 by the Brits, it’s just an hour’s drive from Halifax, and is best known for its beautiful, multicoloured 18th- and 19th-century buildings. There are so many shades, from tomato red, to deep purple and peppermint green ... strolling around and taking it all in is a delight, especially along King St, which has been nicknamed “the Unesco fresco”.Lunenburg is the perfect place to go kayaking. Set off from the bay at Blue Rocks, a spectacular 10-minute drive along the coast from the town of Lunenburg, and paddle through dozens of little channels out to the open sea. There’s plenty of nature around - I saw an osprey, and a huge heron. And I do love that people here spend so much time outdoors – they have everything on their doorstep.Back in Lunenburg, lunch at the Beach Pea Kitchen \u0026amp Bar  – they have some cracking fishcakes. Most restaurants here serve fish and seafood, and it’s all so beautifully fresh. Spend the rest of the day hanging out in town, just walking around and taking in the scenery and the slower pace of life. For dinner, treat yourself to lobster at the Old Fish Factory restaurant, one of the best places in town for it.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site, about an hour from Lunenburg, has got an incredible collection of petroglyphs, stories carved on rocks by the Mi’kmaq, a First Nations people, thousands of years ago. Our guide was great, and told us all about their history, and the people who’d created the carvings. The Mi’kmaw people, for instance, are credited with inventing the ice hockey stick – they are recorded as having played the game as early as the 18th century. Today, October is celebrated as Mi’kmaq history month, and the entire Mi’kmaw Nation celebrates Treaty Day annually on 1 October – the date when the Peace and Friendship treaty of 1752 was signed by the Mi’kmaq of Shubenacadie and the Brits.Peggy’s Cove is the perfect place to stretch your legs on the drive back to Halifax, and take in some amazing views of sea and sky. It’s got a strikingly elegant lighthouse, but what impressed me most were the rocks which covered the whole area – it looked like the moon, a completely alien landscape.Finish the day back in Halifax dining with locals at Edna, which stands for “eat, drink, nourish, always”. It does a mix of fish, meat and veggie dishes, and you eat at communal tables, which is fun.Start your morning with a sail around Halifax harbour on the stunning schooner Bluenose II. It’s a faithful reconstruction of the first Bluenose, a 1920s racing and fishing ship that, unfortunately, sank in 1946. We set off at full sail and got amazing views of Halifax from the water. The captain, Phil, is a great character, with a huge beard!Then it was time to do my mural the space was a stairwell at the back of the Marriott Harbourfront hotel. Normally it would take me around three days to do a piece this size (it’s around 7 x 10 metres) but we only had a day! I used inspiration from all the places I’d seen, so there were lots of muted greens to represent things like moss on the rocks at Peggy’s Cove, and mustard colours for the seaweed at Blue Rocks, then lighter notes like peppermint green for the houses in Lunenburg.For dinner, try the Bicycle Thief, a lovely, laid-back Italian restaurant. The spaghetti with meatballs is massive and delicious!The next day, before I left for the airport, I spent a few more hours finishing the mural. A lot of people helped, like a guy from the crew of the Bluenose II, who’s also a street artist. It felt great to give something to the community I hope they like it! I’d love to come back and spend more time in Nova Scotia – hopefully that’ll happen soon.Inspired to visit?

Queues are much shorter at major attractions such as Niagara Falls, so why not take a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, a ride on Niagara Helicopters or a thrilling MistRider zipline ride? The spring weather is ideal for bike tours of Niagara’s wineries, distilleries and craft breweries, such as Niagara Oast House Brewers.If you would like to see where maple syrup comes from, around March is the time to join a Sugar Bush tour to see how the trees are tapped or find a pancake festival in April to enjoy the end product. This season is also a good time to go hiking before the crowds come out and the weather heats up. The Bruce Trail (Unesco biosphere designated) stretches from the Niagara Escarpment to Tobermory, 500 miles of scenic trails, while you don’t even need to leave Toronto to hike the forested slopes of the 16 hectare (40-acre) High park.Summer unofficially starts on the third weekend of May with the Victoria Day holiday marking Queen Victoria’s birthday. It’s the start of cottage season, when all roads lead to Georgian Bay, Muskoka or Lake Simcoe, for barbecues, watersports and weekend partying at Ontarians’ seasonal residences. With the weather hot and humid, Ontario has endless supplies of water to cool off in paddle or cruise around the 1,000 Islands near Kingston, sail on the Great Lakes, or enjoy a canoe or kayak adventure on one of the many lakes or rivers in Muskoka. Whitewater raft just 90 minutes from Ottawa, along the Ottawa River or take a LeBoat cruiser along the Rideau canal to Kingston.Don’t miss the waterways of Algonquin park – Justin Trudeau spent his childhood summers here.

Then Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron in Northern Ontario is the place to be, with over 800km of road-biking routes.Summer is the peak season for festivals – starting with the major fun around Canada Day on 1 July anywhere in Ontario, and then you have choices that range from the Niagara wine festival to TIFF (Toronto international film festival), taking in Nuit Blanche art projects at major art venues, and even music and food truck festivals. Let’s not forget Glengarry Highland Games, the Whitchurch-Stouffville strawberry festival and the Toronto Summerlicious food festival, where more than 200 restaurants offer specially priced set menus, among many others.As the leaves start to fall, enjoy the abundance of colours in Ontario’s thousands of miles of forest. Allow two weeks for a proper fly-drive tour from Toronto of highlights including Niagara, Blue Mountain, Muskoka, Algonquin park, Ottawa, 1,000 Islands and Prince Edward County. September and October are also prime times for spotting the northern lights ride the Polar Bear Express  from Cochrane to Moosonee for your best chance of catching this natural phenomenon.In Ottawa, this is a good time to visit the National Gallery of Canada, the city’s premier art collection, or the fascinating Canadian Museum of History, the most visited museum in the country. Take a cycle tour to explore the capital’s many interesting neighbourhoods such as Byward Market and Centretown, indulge in a craft brewery tour or a food tour (or both!). Overindulgence in good food and drink peaks around Canada’s Thanksgiving in October. Major events to look out for include the Blue Mountains apple harvest festival, Bala cranberry festival, and Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest. Many small towns have their own homely harvest and pumpkin festivals, complete with family fun such as traditional music and ploughing matches.As the snowfall peaks, ice hockey fills the TV schedules but it’s even more fun to get out and enjoy the winter wonderland for yourself. This is the time of year when the mist and spray off Niagara Falls freezes on the rocks, adding to the spectacle. For skiing, Blue Mountain is Ontario’s largest resort and great for beginners. Resorts in the Blue Mountain region or Muskoka, such as the luxurious JW Marriott Rosseau, Sherwood Inn, and Cedar Grove Lodge, or Deerhurst in Huntsville offer activities including cross-country skiing, skating, snow shoeing, snowmobiling and dog sledding, with a whole menu of spa treatments to ease any tired muscles.Ontario’s many spas include award-winning ones in Niagara and Prince Edward County, perfect for a break at any time of year but even cosier when the weather is chilly outside. At St Anne’s spa, 90 minutes from Toronto, you can even get wrapped in hot chocolate. For festive festivals, look out for Winterlude in Ottawa, with ice-carving, skating and curling the Icewine festival in Niagara Falls (which also celebrates its food), Winterlicious in Toronto (more seasonal culinary delights!), and Sault Sainte Marie’s Winter Carnival Bon Soo, complete with polar bear swims (where you swim like one, through an ice hole, rather than with one).Discover more of what Ontario has on offer all year round with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0750ebac2e4462646f0893eed58bdd55a74e413c/0_196_4944_2966/master/4944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de3e295285025044be7cb67d600c3457","title":"testing four year olds begins september parents in dark schools","story":"Government says no obligation to tell families as 10,000 schools sign up to pilotsSophia is four and shy, especially around strangers. In September she starts school and Hayley Phillips, her mother, already worried about how her daughter will settle in, has found out she will have to sit a test.In the first six weeks of the new school year, four- and five-year-olds in nearly 10,000 schools, about half of the primary schools in England, will be taken out of class and asked questions for the new reception baseline assessment (RBA).Phillips knew to ask about the assessments because she is a teacher at another school, but most parents will be unaware they are happening. Parents have no legal right to know – according to the Department for Education (DfE), it is up to the discretion of the inidual schools whether to inform them.Nancy Stewart, of the campaign group More Than a Score, argues that parents have a right to know if the government is testing their child and holding the results. “We think parents should know that the first few weeks of their child’s time in reception class could be disrupted by these unnecessary tests. We urge parents to ask their child’s teacher and headteacher if they are going to take place,” she says.According to the government, the controversial test is a “20-minute check of language and ability to count” that will provide a snapshot of children’s development when they start school “just like checking their teeth or eyesight”. The results will be used to measure progress by the time the child sits key stage 2 tests at age 11. Many teachers and child development experts are fiercely opposed to the test, arguing it will lead to more formalised teaching and less play.Phillips, from Sevenoaks, Kent, wants to withdraw her daughter, but parents have no right to do so.Tomorrow, families opposed to the tests are going to the high court in London to try to stop them, claiming they will cause distress and damage children’s future learning. They are asking the judge to allow a judicial review of the government’s decision to pilot the tests in September before introducing them across England in 2020.Lisa Richardson, solicitor for Irwin Mitchell, representing the families, says they fear their children could face harm: “They are worried about the immediate distress experienced by some children in the assessment process itself, and the longer-term impact on their education because of schools potentially using the feedback from the assessment to label or stream children at such a young age.” Phillips says: “I know about the tests only because I am a teacher and I asked. Her school said every child will be sitting the test. I said, well, not my daughter because it is a pilot and not statutory. I was told I would have to discuss it at the home visit in the first week of term in September.” She adds: “I’ve nothing against the school. I’m sure the assessment will be done in the nicest possible way, but I want Sophia to be able to play and bond with her reception teacher and teaching assistants. I’m not sure that if she is taken out of class on her own she would be able to respond to the questions, even if she knew the answers. I don’t think it would be a fair representation of what she can do and it is of no benefit to the children.” The DfE says the test is not a measure of inidual children and will not be kept on their school records. “The pilot is an opportunity for schools to familiarise themselves with the format and help us make sure it works – that’s why it’s so significant that almost 10,000 schools have registered. It is up to schools whether or not to tell parents that they are taking part. This is the case with all assessment pilots,” says a spokesman. “The assessment will be stress-free for children as it will reflect normal classroom activities.” But many parents and teachers are not convinced. Sharon Vince, another parent, from London, who is also a teacher, is planning to make a stand. “My daughter starts school in September and I have written to her headteacher asking them to reconsider taking part in the pilot,” she says. “I found out my daughter’s school will be piloting them at a meeting with other teachers. I would have expected the school to tell parents,” she says.“We teachers do assessment all the time, observing children as they play and talking to them in natural situations, which is quite different from taking them out of class for 20 to 30 minutes and asking them questions with right and wrong answers.“And what about those with English as an additional language? Children could get a label assigned to them and that can be difficult to shake off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff5ccf615e31d601b9a0f083436bdbf0fcd0f1f/0_0_4696_2818/master/4696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d0aa8535e5128bca8083540c7bf1705","title":"680m of uk foreign aid spent of fossil fuel projects study","story":"Cafod says UK is saddling poorer nations with outdated, polluting technologiesThe British government has spent £680m of its foreign aid budget on fossil fuel projects since 2010, according to analysis that highlights the UK’s failure to align diplomatic, trade and aid policies with the goals of the Paris climate agreement.Britain allocated more overseas development cash to oil and gas in the two years after signing the 2015 agreement than it had in the previous five, according to the study commissioned by the Catholic development agency Cafod and carried out by the Overseas Development Institute. Although the UK also increased support for renewables, Cafod said the continued support for carbon-intensive energy in middle-income countries was erting resources that should be used to help poor communities gain access to electricity from wind and solar power.“The UK wants to be a leader on climate change, so it’s shocking that UK aid money is still being spent on fossil fuels overseas,” said Sarah Wykes, Cafod’s lead analyst on climate change and energy.“At a time when we are reducing the UK’s own reliance on fossil fuels, why are we spending billions of pounds saddling poorer nations with outdated technologies that will cause more climate damage? The whole point of development aid is to improve the lives of people living in poverty. The government needs to align its aid spending with its climate goals and urgently commit to ending all new aid for fossil fuels.”In recent months the UK parliament has declared a climate emergency and the government has announced plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Next year it is expected Britain will host a United Nations climate summit, where nations will try to draw up more ambitious plans to limit further global heating.Most of this came in the form of export credit guarantees by UK Export Finance. An earlier analysis by DeSmog UK, an investigative environmental journalism outlet, found an elevenfold increase in UK Export Finance support for overseas fossil fuel projects last year, including oil and gas operations in Oman, Kuwait and Brazil.The Department for International Development stressed that it has provided 17 million people with access to clean energy, but recognised the need to shift further from fossil fuels.“We need to do more if we are going to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate,” a government spokesman said. “As the prime minister announced at the G20 last month, in future we will look for the greenest way to deliver UK aid. Developing countries will be hardest hit by climate change. We cannot eradicate poverty without also protecting the environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6967e6cd6884185efdcd36714fe6526dc711565/31_142_2210_1326/master/2210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb217b2429686c846b420e35f0199a1f","title":"powerful undersea images photographer roger grace in pictures","story":"The marine biologist, conservationist and specialist underwater photographer Roger Grace died at his New Zealand home in June.

I love wearing a big skirt where your hips feel free.I originally started dressing in vintage because, when I was in high school, I couldn’t afford the designer jeans that my friends had. I discovered vintage and would try on clothes that reminded me of things I saw in magazines. I wore lingerie as outerwear, little bustiers, and tried to throw together a look that wasn’t reliant on having money.This was in the 90s, when vintage clothes weren’t quite as valuable as they are now.

The Fulham vice-chairman and director of football operations had been talking with the excellent podcast Fulhamish late last month, addressing the issues which had contributed to a traumatic one‑season stay in the top flight and the sense of anticlimax which had accompanied the club’s slump back into the second tier.For all his enthusiasm for social media, the audience felt rare, even bold given the club’s lack of activity up to then in the transfer market. Yet, with additions and a key contract renewal pending, Khan’s outlook had been bullishly optimistic for the campaign ahead.“We have a tightly knit group who really want to be at Fulham, care about Fulham and care about each other,” he offered as a tub-thumping pay-off. “It’s been a hard year for everybody, but the break has done us some good. Now, everybody is really focused and ready to go out and smash the Championship.”It helped that loan players were released – including André Schürrle, whose two-year switch from Borussia Dortmund could be cancelled as a result of demotion. Another of the bigger earners, Jean Michaël Seri, will spend the season at Galatasaray, who paid a loan fee of £1.3m with the option to make the deal permanent for £15m next summer. Yet, even with Harvey Elliott to sign for Liverpool and Ryan Sessegnon expected to move to Tottenham Hotspur for around £20m, this group boasts eye-catching quality. Perhaps the early inevitability of relegation allowed time for proper planning. Regardless, they seem prepared.In Scott Parker they boast a head coach of potential who knows the club, buys into the recruitment strategy and will urge his players to replicate the scintillating form which took Slavisa Jokanovic’s team to promotion via the play-offs. Parker, like Khan, saw the value in retaining the core of the group who did so well in the Championship last time. The masterstrokes may have been persuading the captain, Tom Cairney, and, more pertinently given the suitors eager to prise him away, Aleksandar Mitrovic to sign new five-year contracts.Khan has become close to Gestifute’s Jorge Mendes, and used the Portuguese agent’s relationship with Wolverhampton Wanderers to lure Ivan Cavaleiro from Molineux. The loan signing from Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion of Anthony Knockaert, who has thrived at this level twice before and could join permanently for £10m next summer, completed the construction of a mouthwatering frontline. Stefan Johansen’s return from a loan at West Bromwich Albion is reassuring, while Aboubakar Kamara has been reintegrated, a brave move after last season’s rumpus in a yoga session and his subsequent arrest for an alleged assault at Motspur Park. Neither club nor police are pursuing that matter, with the forward’s return after a loan in Turkey made with the blessing of the management and senior players. Kamara can make a difference at this level.This is an ownership eager to learn from mistakes. That frantic trolly dash last summer, which appeared to lack a coherent strategy and ended up disrupting the rhythm of a team on the up, counts against the hierarchy, though there were mitigating circumstances. Khan has pointed to the play-off campaign delaying plans, with the World Cup another hindrance as he sought to strengthen a side who had relied heavily upon loan players. Yet if Mitrovic, Anguissa, Mawson and Joe Bryan – all purchased that summer – excel then that outlay could be cast in a different light. They might even have a team that are Premier League ready, like Wolves, if promotion is secured.Throw in an academy, overseen expertly by Huw Jennings, which is seeking to expand and continues to nurture talent, and the redevelopment of the Riverside stand – the capacity at Craven Cottage will be reduced to around 19,000 this season – and the overriding optimism feels justified. “Nobody at Fulham liked the way last season went,” the vice‑chairman said. “But we’ve kept the spirit and backbone of a really strong team who, two seasons ago, went 23 games unbeaten to end the season. It was the best day I’ve ever had to go to Wembley stadium and win the Championship play-off final but, this year, our goal is to be auto-promoted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/557684166abafc7d928fa89cd8e05c5d2c04186b/0_73_5142_3085/master/5142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9265ff57cdae80edbf84e60c25b42d8e","title":"gareth bale move real madrid not loan agent jonathan barnett zinedine zidane","story":"While Zinedine Zidane expects Gareth Bale to leave Real Madrid imminently, the player’s agent says his move will not be a loan. The Wales forward, who has been linked to a move to the Chinese Super League, is only interested in a permanent move away from the Spanish side.On Tuesday Bale’s agent Jonathan Barnett told Sky Sports News: “There will be no makeshift deals to get him out of the club. Gareth is one of the best players on the planet. I can guarantee you he will not be going on loan to any club.”In response to a question on the player’s absence from Sunday’s pre-season game against Bayern Munich in Washington, Zidane replied: “Gareth didn’t play because he didn’t want to”, having earlier said: “The club is dealing with his departure … Bale’s not in the squad because the club is working on his exit. We will see what happens in the coming days.”Bale’s relationship with Zidane has broken down, with the coach having been emphatic that a move is the right solution for both player and club. Despite 29 league appearances for the club last season Bale, who turned 30 last week, was a regular fixture on the bench in the latter stages, and opted against joining his teammates for the end-of-season lap of honour at the Bernabéu after being an unused substitute in defeat to Real Betis on the last day.His most likely route away from the Bernabéu remains a move to a Super League club in China. His options have been limited by his age, potential transfer fee and salary – he is currently earning €17m (£15.25m) a year after tax.Barnett added: “Gareth is a Real Madrid player and for now he’s staying as a Real Madrid player. If something comes along that suits us, then things could change and he could be gone in a day or a week. Or he could still be a Real player in three years when his contract ends.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57494caa10465b32f71d99c86fe060c6fbdd8e08/1077_932_973_584/master/973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee35f4203c71ae1686f96a6895f14b5","title":"david squires on new football kits betting and banter","story":"With the new season getting ever nearer, our cartoonist looks at Fictional FC’s attempts to design and launch a new kit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8403bbfa3d7fc30aa84c05c5288bcab83bbfd6fc/0_525_7787_4671/master/7787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9550fe372c6b9479c901167ec6879e11","title":"why i chose to have a fertility mot","story":"An increasing number of women are paying to have their fertility assessed. How much do the tests really reveal about their ability to conceive?I am in a determinedly neutral room on Harley Street, my feet in stirrups, my dignity nearly preserved by a flimsy sheet. On the monitor in front of me is my womb, empty of baby but nevertheless being energetically narrated by Prof Nick Macklon. He points out my contraceptive device, my uterine lining gearing up for evacuation in about a fortnight, the visible vacancy left by my just-departed egg – Macklon describes it all as being like a pivotal scene in an action movie. The stakes, certainly, feel high.I am midway through my “fertility MOT”: yes, like for a vehicle, but for my ovaries. The two-part process – offered by the London Women’s Clinic (LWC) and other fertility clinics like it, for a few hundred pounds – consists of a blood test followed two weeks later by a “not overly invasive” pelvic ultrasound. Alongside a consultation about your medical history and lifestyle, the results help you to understand your own fertility status and likely ability to conceive, now and in the future. “I must say, I really hate that term, ‘MOT’,” Macklon, medical director of LWC, had remarked earlier, back at his desk. “Women aren’t cars.” We aren’t cars – but there are a lot of fiddly parts, which we are mostly ignorant of until they don’t work.If you had asked me half an hour ago – as I sat in the clinic’s stately waiting room, a baby’s cry faintly, ominously audible from afar – I would have put my grasp on my fertility as slightly above average. I knew, for example, that I had been born with a finite number of eggs and that, at 28, I was approaching the age at which I should be starting to take it seriously. But with the reality of children still entirely, ludicrously at odds with my day-to-day life, I had felt content to leave the picture blurry.I wasn’t even sure that I wanted them, after all. From when I was a little girl to my mid-20s, I had steadfastly maintained that I would never have children of my own. In recent years, my flatmate had amassed a collection of photographs of me holding babies, their faces creased in terror, that, as a whole, seemed to form some damning body of evidence of my lack of maternal instincts.But as I reached my late 20s, something started to shift, tediously on schedule. Choices such as whether to move country, or change job, or dump or not-dump a boyfriend started to seem properly consequential. Friends my age started admitting to concerns about “running out of time” older friends who had witnessed too many heartbreaking struggles to conceive, urged me to take them seriously. And the reality of being a woman means you are afforded the luxury of ambivalence only for so long.The MOT service, offered by LWC for the past two years, was born of two things, says Macklon: greater clarity about the impact of time on fertility, and the widespread lack of awareness of it. A 2018 meta-study concluded that “knowledge is insufficient, particularly in determining when female fertility markedly decreases” – and this despite the tendency to delay children until later in life. In 2016, the average age of women at first birth was 28.8 years, compared with 27.3 years in 2006. “There is clearly a lack of understanding among women that, essentially, their fertility ends about 10 years before they get their menopause, rather than when they get their menopause,” says Macklon. “That is the huge information gap.”Though they may be getting periods, many women do not even start reliably ovulating every month until they are in their mid-20s. Fertility peaks soon after, then starts to decline, though “not catastrophically”, Macklon adds. “It’s probably a steady progression downwards from about the age of 27 or 28.” My age, then. I am starting to feel a bit panicked. The fertile window is from the mid-20s to the mid-30s – not exactly languorous, even with physiology on your side, and that can vary significantly.I was correct that women were born with all the eggs they will ever have, about 1m of them, but that number has usually halved by puberty – and I am shocked to learn that we lose about 30 to 40 eggs each month. Before each period, Macklon explains with enthusiasm, “a whole group of eggs will have decided: ‘It’s our time now. We’ve been waiting 20-odd years this is it, off we go.’” Hooked on hormones, they start growing.Two weeks before ovulation, between about five and 20 eggs – a clutch, if you will – will be contenders. “Of those 20, maybe one will be a little bit more mature, a little bit more sensitive to the hormones” – and that frontrunner will start producing another hormone to stymie its competitors. “It’s very interesting sibling behaviour,” says Macklon, almost fondly. (And just as cut-throat as sperms’ race to fertilise, I note – without any of the mythologising.)Over time, women not only lose eggs, but their quality depletes. “The consequences are, as women leave childbearing until their late 30s, their chances of producing an egg that is of high enough quality to produce a healthy baby falls,” says Macklon. The fertility MOT can give an indication of “where an inidual is on their biological clock”, and that there is demand for it reflects a more proactive approach to family planning.Ranging in price from about £200 for a consultation with no pelvic ultrasound, up to £450 for a male and female package (and £640 for two women), the service is not cheap, and about half the 800 women a year who undergo the consultation with LWC do so as a first step towards starting fertility treatment, “rather than for reassurance or help with future planning”, says Macklon.Those women whose MOTs return problematic results may also be advised to consider egg-freezing, prompting concerns that the tests could be steering them down an uncertain, expensive path.The British Fertility Society (BFS) says that it is important to remember that these tests were developed to inform IVF treatment, not natural fertility, and as such are open to interpretation: “There is no doubt that tests showing a good ovarian reserve are reassuring but they by no means guarantee a baby equally, a poor or impaired ovarian reserve does not mean you will struggle and need fertility treatment.Dr Raj Mathur, the BFS secretary, says his view of egg-freezing is “cautiously favourable … but like everything, we are in danger of overselling its benefits and not adequately reflecting the problems”.Similarly, he said, though the MOT might help some women and couples in their family planning, it should not be mistaken for a comprehensive diagnosis of inidual fertility. “They are not looking at other aspects of women’s fertility – whether you ovulate or not, whether your fallopian tubes are blocked – and they are often not looking at the man. They are a kind of incomplete snapshot of one aspect of a couple’s ability to conceive, and that can easily give false reassurance.”The blood-test component of the MOT measures levels of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) given off by growing follicles, which indicates how many eggs you have left – but a study last year found that a diminished ovarian reserve was not associated with infertility. “If you’re just starting to try for a baby, a low AMH or a high AMH will not affect your chance of conceiving,” says Mathur. Macklon agrees that a single measure of AMH says little, but adds that in the context of the MOT, and discussed in the broader context of the inidual’s medical, personal and lifestyle history, it helps to estimate the length of the patient’s reproductive period.At the start of his career, Macklon says, he was typically tasked with problems of infertility: “You know: ‘I’ve tried for children for three years. It hasn’t worked can you help?’ Now, it’s completely different.” Over the past decade, and particularly the past five years, he has been more often approached by single women and new couples wanting to know if they should get a move on. There is “increasing realisation”, reflected in the rising interest in the MOT, “that maybe it’s a good thing to plan these things”.Yet many women – even those who know for sure that they want children one day – still leave any further interrogation of the idea until it is either a practical reality or there is possible cause for concern. “One of the hardest parts of our job is having to break bad news to women who don’t think they’re going to have a problem,” said Ben Cordle, a spokesman for LWC, when I called him a few weeks ago to make an appointment. It was possible for a fit, healthy woman in her early 30s with no reason to second-guess her fertility to record an AMH level as low as 2, from a healthy given range of 4.1 to 58.In fact, the thought occurred to me only this morning: that this appointment I had made on no greater impulse than mild curiosity could change the course of my life. On my way to the clinic, questions that I had so far kept comfortably peripheral were brought to the front of mind, where they jostled for prominence.The big one, obviously: what if I’m infertile? Then the shades of nuance: if I’m infertile, would I still write a story about it? What if I’m certified so fertile, I can safely push motherhood out to 40-plus – would I leave it as late as I can, or keep pace with my peers? Could I afford to freeze my eggs? Do I even want a baby? And the most frightening thought of all: what if the test says I must have one right now, or never?In this tastefully carpeted clinic, returning to Macklon’s desk after my ultrasound, I am about to find out.Relative to his somewhat whimsical tour of my womb, Macklon is all business as he goes over my results and medical history. I have a normal uterus. A normal endometrial thickness. My right ovary appeared normal, with 10 follicles – also normal – and “the left ovary looked similar”. My AMH level was “within the normal range for a woman of your age”, though on the lower side of the mean value, meaning that I might not like to leave having a baby until my late 30s – but I’d assumed as much.The worst thing I could do between now and then, as far as my fertility is concerned, Macklon says, is take up smoking or get chlamydia.It all somehow feels a bit anticlimactic. But then I realise I am lucky to have that result, lucky to know that I’ve got a few years to go yet. The MOT, Macklon says, presents “some options which we didn’t have in the past other than to say ‘get a move on’ or ‘you can relax’.” A remark he makes in passing lingers with me long after the appointment: “If you think about it, women have to get almost all their life events into a period of about 15 years: career, having children.” It is not long, but I have time – and just the process of finding out has focused my mind on how I want to spend it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9daec3ef68eeaf7f2e8db047b2ae10bd29d2f3b/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9371b7bc1c8a5db87b7c2f0528a253c","title":"zvuk club almaty kazakhstan activists lgbt dance music clubbing","story":"In conservative, authoritarian Almaty, a small techno event aims to create a safe space for activists and the LGBT communityIt is a rainy spring night in Almaty, and in a small back-alley club a young DJ is playing dark British techno while wearing a T-shirt that could easily land him in jail. I’m in a crowd of about 200 at ZVUK, which for the past three years has been a remarkable outlier on the limited clubbing scene of Kazakhstan’s deeply conservative commercial capital.My visit to the city coincided with rare political ructions in a country where little dissent had been tolerated during 30 years of autocratic rule by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. His sudden resignation in March and stage-managed elections in June had led to two protesters being jailed for 15 days for holding up a banner at the Almaty marathon that read: “You cannot run away from the truth.” Days later another man was arrested for holding a banner bearing a line from the constitution: “The only source of state power is the people.” Protests, which reignited after Nazarbayev’s chosen successor was “elected” in June, have been met with more violence and arrests by the security forces.ZVUK is the only party collective in Almaty with a political-activism element, and the night I attended all of its members wore T-shirts bearing the slogan, “You cannot run away from the truth.” As a friend of the collective put it, “in Europe, people like us can express themselves and stand against the government in safety. Here we can be jailed for it.”ZVUK is the brainchild of Nazira Kassenova, an upbeat, intelligent and humorous 28-year-old DJ originally from the small southern city of Taraz. These days she splits her time between Almaty and Berlin, where she is a resident at Room 4 Resistance and a host on Radio Cómeme. She has played at De School in Amsterdam and Berghain in Berlin – arguably Europe’s two best clubs – and in January reached another milestone by contributing to Resident Advisor’s podcast series. The mix is a great primer for her sound: tough, angular, clattering techno and bass music with a constant, addictive groove.Part of what made this unlikely journey possible was four scholarship-funded years at university in St Andrews. During that time she made frequent trips to the Sub Club in Glasgow, which she cites as a defining influence. She returned to Almaty galvanised and ready to do her own thing. “There are three other crews in Almaty doing moderately good stuff,” she says, “but none of them do anything musically, politically or socially challenging. I think that’s fine in places that already have liberal laws and values, but not here.”Since starting ZVUK, Kassenova has brought in two other DJs – Aisha, who mainly plays acid and electro, and ET, who loves “rhythmic, brutal deconstructed club music” – as well as four non-DJ members. It is clear that for all six recruits, as well as the party’s devotees, ZVUK is a life-changing sanctuary. “ZVUK inspired me to pursue my dreams and live my life the way I want, and now I’m a full-time writer able to support myself and my family,” Gera Nogaibayeva, the collective’s operations manager, tells me.“I am a part of the LGBT+ community,” she says, “and we are in often life-threatening danger in our country. To be a part of something that openly celebrates my community and strives to provide a safer space to be yourself is a huge deal.”The fact that much remains to be done regarding LGBT rights had been vividly demonstrated to me earlier that week at a party organised in support of the two jailed activists. The vibe was like that of a bohemian, artistic, politically engaged gathering, but a conversation with Kassenova led to an eye-opening moment.“Almost the whole country is homophobic,” she said, “even some of the people at this party.” She then collared the first person who happened to be passing, a party-hearty, vodka-swilling sculptor in his 30s. “What do you think of gay people?” she asked. He replied without hesitation: “I think they should go and do that in some other country. We don’t want that in Kazakhstan.”The ZVUK party I attended was excellent by any city’s standards, with tight, challenging sets and a deeply engaged and passionate crowd, all in the perfectly sized club Object, the only such independent clubbing space in the city. One of Kassenova’s masterstrokes in building ZVUK has been to inject new perspectives via knowledgeable, thought-provoking international guests, among them Giant Swan, Via App and Don’t DJ. In May the FrenchNorthern Irish producer Zoë Mc Pherson flew in to play, and, like many previous guests, also held a production workshop for a rapt audience a couple of days before the party.Mc Pherson spent 10 days in Kazakhstan and offered interesting takes on the experience as we walked around Almaty’s top brutalist hotspots. “I met a 17-year-old boy on a hike in the mountains,” she said. “We became friends and he came to the workshop with his mother, and the whole family came to the club night. It was the first time he had been to a club, and his mother told me I had opened her ears to a new world of listening.”She was similarly effusive on the crowd at ZVUK who were mesmerised by her hypnotic electronics-and-vocals set. “I have never had a crowd dance together as one like that. Rhythmically, my stuff can seem experimental and awkward and many crowds get confused, but at ZVUK they knew how to rave very naturally to it.”With Kassenova’s DJ career taking off thousands of miles away, she is determined that ZVUK will continue to be a driver of change in Kazakhstan. “For a long time I lost money running ZVUK, and even now we just break even on most parties,” she says. “But for me compromise has always been the number one thing to avoid and it will always be that way. I could easily start flying more straightforward, commercial techno acts in, move to a bigger venue and turn ZVUK into a business. But that wouldn’t help change anything, so fuck that.”“The Bristolian heavy techno duo Giant Swan played here in November and were amazing – one of the best performances we’ve had for sure. But it was long before that that their music was played at the party and at least one GS track is played at every ZVUK, this being a big favourite.”“ET and I are really into what’s nowadays called deconstructed club music, and this is a good example of something that’s at the more experimental end of what we would play at the party.”PTU – Castor and Pollux“Acid is an integral element of ZVUK, and two of our resident DJs are really into this sound. This track is a good representation of the type of acid you’ll hear on an average ZVUK night.”“All of us at ZVUK love super-rhythmic drum tracks, but many people think they always come from the usual European or American techno sources. This is from South Africa and shows that you can find these sounds coming from almost anywhere in the world, if you look.”“Electro is another signature sound at ZVUK, and this is a great example of the kind of electro we love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f345508d0a6826ed2fd0a61d2351bd873912fed/0_0_6347_3808/master/6347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c88efa4a21e3e33dc066ee3383ff0c49","title":"stranded in pakistan why did the home office deny a baby a visa","story":"Nina Saleh, a British resident for 20 years, travelled to Pakistan to adopt a baby and was then repeatedly denied a visa, leaving her trapped abroad for months on end.

She had become director responsible for services at the then troubled east London council after leaving Ofsted, where she had controversially made the inspection model much tougher.Jones, 69, can now claim vindication: having stood her ground in the face of that damning verdict, and having been backed by the council’s leaders, her two-year turnaround of her department resulted this week in a “good” Ofsted rating and a glowing report describing the achievement as “remarkable”.When she arrived at Tower Hamlets in 2015, initially as an interim appointee, the council’s new mayor, John Biggs, was rebuilding the authority’s credibility after scandals that resulted in the government sending in commissioners to take over core functions.Children’s services – rated “good with outstanding features” by Ofsted in its previous inspection in 2012 – was not then considered a problem area, but Biggs wanted to decouple it from adult social care with which it had been jointly run.Jones soon began to uncover poor practice. “When you started to look, the worms came out in multitudes,” she recalls. “If you look back at the statistics, we were very proud of the fact that we kept kids out of care and we had good preventative services in place. But we were not taking into care the children we should have been. It was a very inward-looking authority.”When Ofsted delivered its “inadequate” rating, she admits it still came as a “huge shock”. But she won the agreement of Biggs and Tower Hamlets’ chief executive Will Tuckley to carry out a 24-month programme to get back to “good”. The council had already committed an additional £4.8m a year for children’s services, recognising past under-investment, but now put about the same again into a short-term “improvement pot” and set up an improvement oversight board chaired by Sir Alan Wood, who had revamped services in neighbouring Hackney.“We stripped everything – and I mean everything – back to basics,” says Jones. “I had an exceptionally good interim team: they were experts, they were rottweilers, they were experienced in work with other authorities that had been on the naughty step.”She will also be budgeting for the costs of dealing with teenagers caught up in gang culture and knife crime, sometimes needing to move them or their families out of the area. Together with so-called jihadi brides and misreported fostering controversies, it’s an issue that has put Tower Hamlets regularly in the news.“We’re always on the front pages, often for things we don’t want to be but increasingly for the good stuff,” says Jones. “It’s an iconic borough. It gets under your skin.” She still shows all the appetite for the job, and the ideas and energy of someone decades younger. Jones says: “Being a director of children’s services has always been the love of my life.”Family: Married, two sons, four grandchildrenEducation: Copthall county grammar school, Barnet, north London Nottingham University (BA sociology) Aston University (MSc public sector management) Bedford College University of London (CQSW).Career: 2015-present: corporate director for children and culture, Tower Hamlets 2013-15: national director for social care and regional director for London, Ofsted 2010-13: director of children’s services, Lambeth (2012-13: president, Association of Directors of Children’s Services) 2007-10: director of children’s services, Luton 2006-07: assistant director, then interim director of children’s services, Stoke-on-Trent 2001-06: assistant director of social services, Durham 1998-2001: assistant director of social services, Slough 1994-98: secondment to Department of Health to develop child protection and childcare practice 1990-94: social work manager, Oxfordshire 1988-90: lecturer, Mid-Warwickshire College 1984-88: social work manager, Warwickshire 1975-84: social worker, Oxfordshire 1972-74: unqualified social worker, Southwark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e86c0a995605b560414527e77404149eba503f/0_2_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e800afc31527fa541475145cc6e3febb","title":"universal credit poor advice costs claimants thousands say mps","story":"DWP accused of failing to help those who unnecessarily signed up for the benefitBenefit claimants are being left thousands of pounds a year out of pocket because jobcentre staff are failing to inform them that they will be worse off if they move prematurely to universal credit, MPs have said.The Commons work and pensions committee accused the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) of failing to inform, protect or compensate claimants who stand to lose up to £400 a month after voluntarily and unnecessarily signing up to universal credit.When claimants discover that they are worse off, the DWP routinely refuses to allow them to move back on to legacy benefits – a lock known internally as the “lobster pot” – even when they complain that they were incorrectly advised to claim by department officials.The committee cites the case of a man with anxiety disorder who heard a radio advert for universal credit and assumed he had to make a claim immediately. He and his wife ended up irreversibly £400 a month worse off. “At no stage was he informed that it was not actually necessary for him to make the claim,” the report says.MPs said universal credit should come with a health warning because it was so difficult for claimants to work out whether it was in their interest to move on to it, and officials took so little care to advise them properly or correct mistakes. All claimants inadvertently left out of pocket should be compensated, they said.The committee said it had little confidence that all DWP and jobcentre staff had a comprehensive understanding of what moving to universal credit meant for different claimants, and cited evidence that officials were not adequately trained in the new system or properly understood the old system.Its chair, Frank Field, said: “In the history of humankind, has there ever been an example of a government introducing a fundamental welfare reform and none of its employees being able to tell if it will leave people better or worse off?”Currently, claimants who wait to be moved to universal credit under the managed transfer process taking place during the next three years will have their income protected, but those who move prematurely or as a result of changed circumstances will not.Ministers originally promised that no claimant would be worse off in cash terms after moving to the new benefit. But the committee estimates about 3 million working families now stand to lose out under universal credit – compared with 2.4 million who will gain – making it critical they receive the correct advice.Those that lose out will see a drop in income of an average £59 a week, or around £3,000 a year. Groups affected include families with a disabled child who stand to lose £30 a week, some disabled claimants who will lose £70 a month, and self-employed claimants who can lose up to £8,000 a year.The trapping of claimants in the “lobster pot” of universal credit was just one of a number of serious flaws and unfairnesses highlighted by MPs in a wide ranging progress report on the troubled evolution of the online benefit project, which its director general calls “the biggest digital development in Western Europe.”The committee remains deeply concerned that universal credit is far from fit for purpose and the DWP is moving too slowly to bring in design changes announced by ministers to address problems that have left claimants in debt, food insecurity and at risk of eviction.A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal credit helps people into work faster than the old system and provides targeted support. Around one million disabled households will gain an average of £100 more a month, and changes to work allowances mean 2.4 million households will be up to £630 per year better off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd42d162606c23eeca74b4c858babf7f2886add1/0_134_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d46dc304804e43530d0d3d1096b521f6","title":"adam peaty backs duncan scott decision snub sun yang swimming world championships","story":"Adam Peaty has backed the decision by British bronze medallist Duncan Scott to snub Sun Yang on the podium on Tuesday after the controversial Chinese swimmer’s victory in the 200 metres freestyle at the world championships in Gwangju.Sun, who is swimming under a cloud in Gwangju with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) set to hear a doping case against him in September, was handed the win when Lithuanian Danas Rapsys was disqualified for a false start.Scott congratulated silver medallist Katsuhiro Matsumoto of Japan and Russian Martin Malyutin, who finished in the same time as the Briton, but completely blanked Sun on the podium.The Chinese swimmer reacted angrily, shouting “you’re a loser, I’m a winner” while gesturing at Scott, who also refused to take part in a group photo on the podium and kept his distance from Sun as they left the stage.And while Scott declined to elaborate on his actions to reporters his teammate Adam Peaty, who swam in the 50 breaststroke semi-finals, said Scott was “completely right” to take action, adding that Sun should consider his place in swimming.“He should be asking himself now should he really be in sport when the people were booing him, but I know how they are and I know how he is so ...” Peaty, who has previously criticised Sun and the decision to allow him to compete in Gwangju with the doping case hanging over him, said athletes had a right to speak out.The incident comes two days after Australian Mack Horton refused to share the podium with Sun after the 400.Sun, who served a doping ban in 2014 and was labelled a “drug cheat” by Horton before the Rio Olympics final, got the green light to compete in Gwangju after being cleared by a Fina panel of breaching the governing body’s rules earlier this year.Sun, who also won gold in the 200 in 2017, touched in a time of 1:44.93, with Matsumoto 0.29 behind in second and Malyutin and Scott taking bronze, 0.70 off Sun’s time.The crowd at the Nambu University Municipal Aquatics Center jeered the decision to disqualify Rapsys, who seemed to twitch on the starting blocks. The Lithuanian did not stop for questions after the race. There was a mixed reaction to Scott’s behaviour on the podium, with Chinese fans shouting and jeering while others cheered him as he left the pool deck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/176bc226fc8f1008a60ab596e9859eb701617a1a/15_80_1706_1023/master/1706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40062b8247a4ec8f06ebe6b6f91ac5d5","title":"the spin part time bowlers atherton gooch vaughan tendulkar","story":"Michael Atherton’s dismissal of Graham Gooch and Michael Vaughan bowling Sachin Tendulkar show the finality of cricketAttending sporting events is a sensory experience. The smell of burgers, beer and skunk can mean only football the sight of a nun fighting a giraffe is darts in excelsis and at Wimbledon, unbearable conversation is so intense you can taste it.Cricket is no different. Skip out for a pint of fizz and the sound of the crowd tells you exactly what you’re missing – mainly very little, but occasionally, rippling applause for a four, throaty hollering for a wicket, cheers and laughter for tailend runs. These days we probably have to call it chaughter.Sadly, no portmanteau incorporates three words – there’s not even a word for a word that incorporates three words. But add shock into the mix and we get shchaughter, the joyous, particular sound of a part-time bowler snagging a frontline batsman.A sustaining beauty of elite competition is its legitimisation of humiliation for our delectation – the revenge of the talentless. Cricket, an inidual sport masquerading as a team game, makes this as painful as possible.Whatever their discipline, players are out there on their own: their numbers are their own, their failures are their own, their misery is their own. This is especially rough for batsmen, the finality of dismissal a minor version of death, roughly half the days of their professional lives. When it happens in the morning they can at least wade into lunch, but otherwise they take a long walk out, a long walk back in, then keep walking until their next go. And if they had their pants pulled down by an amateur in front of a disbelievingly exultant crowd, that makes for quite the trek.In July 1992, Lancashire visited Essex for a NatWest Trophy tie, pitting against one another England team-mates Michael Atherton and Graham Gooch. Batting first, Lancashire set a target of 319, but bowling the first over of Essex’s reply, Phil DeFreitas diddled his groin and Atherton completed it for him. He later returned to the attack and, with Essex 123 for none, Atherton – or “Fec” as he was known, abbreviated from “Future England Captain” – loped a nominal leg-spinner to Gooch – or “Captain” as he was known, abbreviated from “actual England captain”.Gooch, 49 not out, had already swept his man for four so got down to repeat the shot, only to confuse the one that didn’t turn with the one that went straight on … under-edging behind, where the ball duly lodged between Warren Hegg’s ankles. Down he went to retrieve it, up went the umpire’s finger, the quietened crowd amplifying the profound shchaughter of the away support.Gooch, famed for his carefree approach to life, then stalked off in disbelief, while Atherton led a bout of gleeful giggling before snaffling his bunny’s job the following summer.Even better came in 2002, when India toured England. They were thrashed in the first Test at Lord’s and in the second at Trent Bridge posted 357, only for England to retort with 617. So, when they found themselves 11 for two in their second innings, they were in all sorts. Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar then built a match-saving partnership.At the time, Tendulkar boasted 29 Test hundreds and a Test average of 56.96 – he was magical everywhere and against everyone. As Shane Warne memorably surmised, Brian Lara was the third-best batsman in the world – behind Tendulkar and daylight.Tendulkar rattled along to 85 off 89 balls as the score reached 159, persuading Nasser Hussain to invite a spell of what Vaughan called his “less than magical off-spin”. He reeled through two uneventful overs before tossing up the final delivery of his third, which Tendulkar drove through the covers for four.So, recalled Vaughan in his autobiography: “I decided to throw one up further and wider the next time”, tempting Tendulkar to chase it … which he only went and did. The ball hit the rough and ragged through his gate as he barely retained balance, bowling him for 92 – 105 fewer than Vaughan made in England’s first innings.Immediately following the death rattle comes a cry of “YES!” from Alec Stewart behind the stumps as the crowd go momentarily silent, registering, then processing, what they’ve just seen. A shocked Tendulkar regains his footing and turns, gripped by the overwhelming urge to inspect stumps he knows are broken. Meanwhile, Vaughan wheels away ohhhhing as another “Ohhhhhh!” comes from the crowd. And then everyone begins shchaughing – at SR Tendulkar, the greatest batsman in the world. With great power comes greater ignominy.Ten days and 78.4 overs of stewing later, Tendulkar batted again. He made 193, but it changed nothing because horror, and that moment, are eternal – as Vaughan reminds him whenever they meet. Though he probably doesn’t see Vaughan often, he probably isn’t the butt of a joke all that often either, and the overriding memory of that tour, for evermore, is him getting out-thought and out-skilled by the future politics spokesman of Medical Hair Studios.More than a decade later, Vaughan could be found on national radio, yukking it up about the “greatest ever” being “in my back pocket”, because who wouldn’t be?Tendulkar will surely have known what was in store, but signed the offending off-stump and ball for Vaughan. Whether Gooch did similarly for Atherton remains one of the game’s great mysteries.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

The very same day play got under way in the 148th Open the papers here led with the Boris Johnson line, first reported in the Financial Times, about Leo Varadkar, “why isn’t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?” Add it to the list, along with Iain Duncan Smith’s blithe dismissal of “this Irish stuff”, Karen Bradley’s blunt admission of her own ignorance of the difference between unionists and nationalists, Priti Patel’s bright idea to leverage the threat of food shortages in the Brexit negotiations, and countless others.“What kills you is the ignorance,” the Irish journalist Megan Nolan wrote in the  last October, about her experience of living in England for three years. “What grinds you down is how much they don’t know about the past and, if they do know, how little they care.”In the , Ireland’s former ambassador to the UK, Bobby McDonagh, couched it in more diplomatic language. “A large swathe of opinion in London, although of course by no means everyone, has come to misunderstand seven major aspects of Ireland: our motivation, allegiance, influence, intelligence, resolve, politics and friendship.”Pottering around Portrush last week was a short, quick and incomplete reminder of all this English obliviousness. “Why didn’t you ever tell me how beautiful Portrush is when the sun’s out?” I asked a friend who spent all his young summers here.The Irish did. They spent years pestering the R\u0026ampA to try to persuade them to bring the Open back there. In the end it almost got to be a running joke. Every Open starts with a press conference held by the R\u0026ampA’s chief executive and one of the Irish journalists would always make a point of asking whether they had any plans to bring the championship back there for the first time in 51, 52, 53 years and counting. And the R\u0026ampA’s chief executive, Peter Dawson, would always find some new way to fob them off, usually something about the political climate, or the security risks, or the infrastructure concerns, or the commercial needs.Then Padraig Harrington won the Open at Carnoustie in 2007 and again at Royal Birkdale a year later. And Graeme McDowell won at Pebble Beach in 2010. And Darren Clarke won at Royal St George’s in 2011. And some young, mop-haired kid called Rory McIlroy cleaned up at Congressional in 2011 and Kiawah Island in 2012 and Royal Liverpool and Valhalla in 2014. There are no borders in Irish golf and they all counted as Irish victories. And in the middle of McIlroy’s run Dawson finally relented and made the announcement that the R\u0026ampA were going to bring the Open back to Portrush after all.By then the Irish weren’t asking for the Open but demanding it. Their success has defined this era of the championship. Between them they have won it as many times in the past 12 years as the English have in the previous 68. And it’s an Open secret that their previous four major champions – Harrington, McDowell, Clarke and McIlroy – spent a lot of time lobbying the R\u0026ampA to bring it here. “Gentle ribbing,” McDowell called it. The R\u0026ampA still waited to see whether or not Portrush would do a good job of hosting the Irish Open in 2012, when, in the end, so many people turned up that they broke the attendance record for the European Tour.Well, on Wednesday morning, right around the time that some of the heavier hangovers from Sunday night celebrating the latest Irish major winner may just be beginning to lift, there will be another milestone in sporting relations between the two nations. Ireland are playing their very first Test match against England – and at Lord’s, too, the home of the MCC, one of the few institutions as patrician as the R\u0026ampA. The Irish have been waiting a long time for this one, too, and, while they were, the English were very happy to take advantage of them by recruiting their best players into our own team. It wasn’t just Eoin Morgan but Boyd Rankin, who they abandoned after a single Test, and Ed Joyce, who didn’t even get that many.Here, too, the Irish had to batter the door down just to get the English to answer it. The ECB started giving the Irish regular games only because they were spooked into it when the Irish got India and South Africa to come over and play in a tri-series in 2007. After that the ECB decided to throw the Irish the odd fixture to keep them sweet and make sure there weren’t any more scheduling clashes with their own matches. And then the Irish went and beat them at the 2011 World Cup.Seven years later, they are finally going to play a Test except – except – the ECB, in its wisdom, has decided this landmark match would be the right time to trial a new, four-day format of the sport. Now the game may not have lasted five days anyway, less do these days, but it still feels like a snub.“It’s our greatest test at the greatest ground,” the Irish player Andy Balbirnie said, and here are the English making them play guinea pigs in it because God forbid the Irish should just get to play a regular Test, same as anyone else. It wasn’t meant as an insult, it never is, but it smacks of what Nolan described as the English’s “mix of dismissal and casual disdain”. Maybe if the Irish win this one we’ll finally let them play a five‑day game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d118fba755744a4776f5efc2411c2b58303d0480/0_342_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f0b65193c19a98d0a52234baf3aadf","title":"tour de france stage 16 live","story":"51km to go: There has been no great crosswind-related drama, but the peloton has quickened and the front five’s cushion has deflated to a mere 25ec.52km to go: The peloton has just turned left, into the crosswind section. Ineos have four riders at the front. Meanwhile, I promise I’ll stop bleating on about these sheep now, but the commentary is very much a classic of its ilk:55km to go: It is apparently absolutely roasting in the Gard, and very much a day for squirting water through your helmet.57km to go: The section identified before the start as key, with its potentially intrigue-inducing crosswinds, is about to start. The fab five are still about a minute up the road.Meanwhile in September 1899 when Alfred Dreyfus was found guilty of treason, “the Municipal Council of Lédignan decided to christen a street in their commune, hitherto known as the Rue de la Republique, the Rue Alfred Dreyfus.” This is commendable, though I can find no evidence of such a road still existing.59km to go: Those sheep in full:62km to go: The helicopters film a hilariously bad attempt to make lots of sheep with yellow-dyed wool fill a vaguely shirty shape. The only problem is that when the helicopters arrive none of the sheep are in position, plus their wool isn’t really very yellow, plus they need at least five times as many sheep to fill their shirty shape.68km to go: The fab five’s lead is dropping fast, and is now but a mere 50sec. Not that it was ever particularly daunting.71km to go: The leaders go through Anduze, which is apparently known for its zinc smelting. It also has a clock tower that dates to 1588.73km to go: There has been precisely to change to the race situation since about 180 seconds after the flag was waved. The same five riders lead, with a gap of about 1min 20sec.84km to go: Helicopter cameras linger lovingly on the Terril de Rochebelle, an odd-looking pimple on a hillside. According to my in-depth research, it is an “ old-fashioned slag heap”.87km to go: There is a category four climb up the Côte de Saint-Jean-du-Pin upcoming. They’re about 6km from the summit already, and the leading five stillonce again lead by 1min 20sec.99km to go: Into the last 100km. Nearly there, guys! Meanwhile I’ve been researching all the places on the route over the next 30km or so, trying to find things I can be sarcastic about, but there’s literally nothing to say about any of them.102km to go: The full results of that intermediate sprint:105km to go: “As a serious cyclist, over 11,000 kms this year and two sportives wins, Thomas is my favourite rider,” writes Keith Aitchison, “but only he can do this.” 109km to go: The sprint has been sprinted. Lars Bak pocketed the maximum 20 points.112km to go: The leading five currently have a lead of 1min 20sec over the peloton, though the gap has been expanding and contracting like an overused accordion.115km to go: A snippet of cycling news: the  is reporting that Mark Cavendish, who was controversially left out of Dimension Data’s team for the Tour, will ride the Adriatica Ionica, which starts on Thursday.120km to go: “Any theories on why G seems to fall off more than anyone else? Maybe he doesn’t, it just seems that way,” writes someone on Twitter. I can, I’m afraid, offer few insights into Thomas’s propensity to topple. I did speak to him once, mainly about yoghurt. 124km to go: Now Thomas is leaning on a team car, getting some water squirted down his grazed left leg. “I live near Uzès and work in Nîmes so of course I have managed to be in Paris today, and it’s even hotter here,” sniffs Lizz Poulter. “Anyway, to explain Ed’s query, they have reopened a closed railway line especially for today’s stage. I’m not sure you can say Nîmes has a famous bridge - technically the Pont du Gard is between Remoulins and Vers Pont du Gard where the quarry that provided the stone for the Pont is still exploited today. Apologies if you’re getting all this from the TV - I’m enjoying a falafel in a hummous restaurant. It’s great, thanks for asking.”125km to go: Thomas has now rejoined the main group, though it’s a long and straggly one.126 km to go: Thomas has some scrapes on his left arm, but seems otherwise unharmed.128km to go: It looks like Thomas’s front wheel might have just clipped the kerb on a bend, causing him to fall. No other riders were involved. He hopped up and assessed his bike, deciding it wasn’t worth persevering with, and waited a short while until a replacement was proffered. Jonathan Castroviejo and Dylan van Baarle have hung back to help lead him back to the peloton. 130km to go: There is now a little under 20km to go before the day’s intermediate sprint, at Vallerargues. And Geraint Thomas is off his bike!138km to go: The same five are still at the front, with a lead now just above 2min.142km to go: That’s a big tick in the Pont du Gard photo box.144km to go: The leaders will soon reach Pouzilhac. Most mentions of Pouzilhac in the ’s archive concern the business Alain du Pouzilhac, who wasn’t actually from Pouzilhac. They have extended their lead back up to 1min 35sec.149km to go: Ed emails. He has taken a train from Remoulins station. The only sentence on the English-language Wikipedia page isn’t even accurate.150km to go: The leading five are now just 1min 9sec ahead of the peloton. The big-name sprinters will be too keen on winning this stage to let any breakaway steal their glory.151km to go: “Presumably  called it Nismes back in 1853 because they didn’t have a keyboard option to add a circumflex,” suggests Drew Goldie, which seems a very sensible deduction. There is a Nismes in Belgium, but it doesn’t have a famous pont. 153km to go: The peloton has just crossed the Pont du Gard. Photo opportunity alert!158km to go: The leaders’ lead is now at 90sec. The peloton appears entirely unbothered about this.160km to go: The leaders near Remoulins. The Wikipedia entry for Remoulins contains only one piece of information: “Remoulins has a train station. However, no passenger trains are currently scheduled to stop there.”166km to go: The leading five have opened up a gap just north of 50sec on the pack, who seem entirely unbothered and are coasting along at a fairly gentle pace.168km to go: Literally as I press send on that they’re caught by the other three, Lars Bak, Paul Ourselin and Lukasz Wiśniowski. 170km to go: There has been a near-instant breakaway of five, of whom two - Stéphane Rossetto and Alexis Gougeard- have a slight lead.174km to go: The yellow flag has been waved, and it’s go go go!The race start has been postponed, apparently because Alexander Kristoff has a flat tyre. We’re in prime Brits-on-holiday territory here: the Pont du Gard, the very lovely market town of Uzes, Nimes itself, all stuffed full of pink-wine-sipping Brits of a summer. It’s perhaps not the most characterful stage, but for many of us following from afar it’ll be packed with memories.During the rollout and before the full-blooded action, you might want to watch this here video:And action! Apparently the 28km stretch from Aigremont to Uzes towards the end of the stage, when riders will have to deal with testy crosswinds, will be key. That’s about 120km from the start.The riders are gathered at the start, ready for action.Today’s weather forecast for Nimes: 35C and non-stop sunshine, but at least a bit of a breeze. Just the 177km to go.What a job that is, patrolling the streets of France turning penises into aliens and random, unrecognisable shapes.We should be under way in about quarter of an hour. In the meantime, I’m just checking you’ve all seen this:Before the storm, something of a calm, though this stage will be ridden out in utterly blistering heat. No matter how you cut it, riding out in temperatures of 34 degrees in the shade is not the most ideal preparation for three days in the high mountains. The Alps approach, where the destiny of flagging Julian Alaphilippe will be decided. And in truth, if France want to end that 34-year drought, then Thibaut Pinot looks the best hope. A lack of wind means that today’s stage is unlikely to produce the echelons that pegged Pinot back on the tenth stage, and so none of the favourites are likely to haul in time. So, to the sprinters, who have feasted on only the slimmest of pickings this year. Were the likes of Peter Sagan, Elia Viviani, Dylan Groenewegen, Caleb Ewan and Alexander Kristoff able to rest up on Monday? It’s six days since the last sprint stage and much will depend on how the heavier brethren have survived the Pyrenees, which sprinters are still there and which of their lead-out men. Following the rest day, a second day’s respite for the overall contenders, as long as the weather plays ball and there is no wind or rain. This stage is out and home rather than the usual place to place so the changes of direction could make for an gruesome day if there is a strong northerly, as we saw in this area in 2016. In such conditions one favourite thrives: Geraint Thomas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ce8db064eabb9e22a69cc45a9b6d4e10d595f06/392_612_4171_2503/master/4171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0eb918e27ad755df7255039455fb100f","title":"best smartphone iphone samsung google huawei ios android buyers guide compared ranked","story":"Our updated list of the top iOS and Android mobile phones – at the best prices right now Need a new smartphone but don’t know which one is the very best?

Whether your priority is two-day battery life, fantastic camera performance or a spectacular screen, there’s plenty to choose from.This  buyer’s guide to top-end smartphones was last updated on 23 July 2019, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right flagship phone for you.Welcome to one of the ’s new buyer’s guides. This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the  may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer\u0027s guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.The latest superphone undercuts the competition on price while offering a better experience in almost every meaningful way. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the firm’s biggest yet with a monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is arguably the best on any phone. It runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz – compared with 60Hz for the competition – which makes everything from scrolling through lists to smashing through games super slick.The screen is edge-to-edge in every direction too, lacking any intrusions by the notches plaguing rivals as the selfie camera has been moved to a motorised module that pops out of the top of the phone when needed.Speed is the name of the game. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the fastest-feeling smartphone by miles. Part of that is the firm’s excellent version of Android 9 Pie called OxygenOS, which is on-par with Google’s on the Pixels, and the other is the top-of-the-line hardware.It has Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 855 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. But that storage is also much faster than rivals using the new UFS3.0 standard, and the difference in day-to-day usage is palpable.Even the optical in-display fingerprint scanner is the best in the business, beating that on the Huawei P30 Pro and matching traditional capacitive sensors for speed.The triple camera system on the back matches rivals combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. It can’t beat the P30 Pro, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.Battery life is good, but not Huawei-beating. It charges really fast using OnePlus’s WarpCharge system, but there’s no wireless charging, which is a shame. It is water resistant to some extent, but doesn’t have an IP rating. It has dual-sim support in most markets too.The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS, make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7 Pro is most definitely a stretch to use, but it’s a stretch worth makingBuy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experienceDon’t buy if: you don’t want to stretch to such a big phoneThe best iPhone is not the biggest or most expensive. The iPhone XS combines a stunning, good-size 5.8in screen, svelte body and top-notch performance into the most appealing package from Apple to date.Apple’s Face ID is the best face recognition system in the business, the dual-camera system on the back is excellent, as is the performance of the A12 Bionic processor and the class-leading gesture navigation system of iOS, which has replaced the home button of iPhones of yore.You’re also in line for about five years of software updates, which is likely at least two more than any other brand of phone. The iPhone XS is a metal and glass sandwich, and will smash just like the competition when dropped, but the stainless steel sides and glass back exude a luxury feel not matched by other phones. Sadly most will put it in a case.The biggest downsides are the price, which at £1,000 is likely significantly more than the competition, and battery life, which only manages about a day of medium usage. The iPhone XS has wireless charging and supports fast charging via a USB-C to Lightning cable, but only ships with a slow charger in the box. Its cellular modem performance is also not as good as competitors, struggling more to keep a working 4G data connection in congested areas, particularly compared with the Mate 20 Pro.If you’re locked in to iOS, or want the longest software update coverage, then the iPhone XS is the best Apple smartphone you can buy (and not very far behind the Mate 20 Pro overall), thanks to its combination of size, camera, capability and luxurious feel.Buy if: you want the best iPhoneDon’t buy if: you don’t want to spend £999 or want to use AndroidIf you want the sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that’s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that’s the Galaxy S10.The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the very best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great.Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared to rivals, and it’s light too. It’s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display works well, although it’s no longer the fastest on the market.Samsung’s new One UI software, based on Android 9 Pie, is a big leap in making large phone easier to use, putting things you have to touch toward the bottom of the screen and information towards the top. Samsung also gives you the choice of traditional navigation keys or swipe gestures.You should see around three-years of software support from Samsung, although the company is often slow to deliver big Android version updates.The rear triple camera is one of the best allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won’t beat the Huawei P30 Pro, but it keeps up with rest. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the best on the market.Performance is good, but battery life is the S10’s one weakness. It will last a day of usage but not much more. There’s both cable and fast wireless charging to top up during the day and the wireless power share feature turns the phone into an ad-hoc wireless charger for other devices.The big, beautiful screen in a comparatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help tooBuy if: you want the best balance of big screen and small phoneDon’t buy if: you want brilliant battery lifeThe best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. No other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei’s new Leica quad camera.The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 1x 40MP camera is terrific and it’s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn’t enough, there’s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has game-changing low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture.The rest of the phone is excellent too with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is one of the best, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all-round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it’s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared to the OnePlus 7 Pro or iPhone XS Max.The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7 Pro’s. Huawei’s top-notch Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that’ll last around two days. Plus charges the fastest and has wireless charging and power sharing.Huawei’s modified Android 9 Pie, EMUI 9.1, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone’s tastes. Huawei is currently facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro should continue to receive updates as normal, however.The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellentBuy if: you want the best camera on a great phoneDon’t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of HuaweiIf you want big screen, top-spec phone, but don’t want a monster of a phone or to spend £900, then the OnePlus 7 is the one to buy.It has a good-looking 6.41in full HD OLED screen, a widow’s peak-like notch for the selfie camera, slim bezels all round and a premium-feeling metal and glass body matching the quality of others.It has 2019’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of the faster UFS3.0 storage, just like the OnePlus 7 Pro. It also lasts a good 34 hours on a charge, and its Oxygen OS Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too.It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.The downsides are a camera that lacks ultra-wide or zoom capabilities, no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging. You can have it in any colour you like in the UK, as long as that colour is mirror grey. Fetching red and blue versions are available in India and China. It’s also not available in the US, where the previous model the OnePlus 6T is still on sale instead.A great screen with slim bezels, excellent software and the best performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than thisBuy if: you want a top-notch phone but don’t want to spend more than £500Don’t buy if: you want a really good cameraSmartphones are rated by screen size measured on the diagonal in inches. The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it\u0027s difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google\u0027s Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple\u0027s support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google\u0027s three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.Battery life varies drastically between devices, and all-day battery often doesn\u0027t mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you\u0027re out in the evening.Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn\u0027t necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.Wireless charging:\u0026nbspconvenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn\u0027t come in the boxDurability:\u0026nbspgenerally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragileResale value:\u0026nbspiPhones hold their value better than most othersOLED versus LCD: OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaperThese are good phones still worth buying if none of the top four smartphones fit the bill.Apple’s slightly cheaper iPhone XR offers most of the features of the iPhone XS. It has better battery life too, but has a worse camera, a slightly larger, but worse screen and is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it’s the best Apple can make.The iPhone XR looks stunning in red, but it’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone XS still the one to buy if you want an iPhone, but if you want to save money, switch to Android.If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen, then the iPhone XS Max is your only option. But it’s even more expensive and bigger and heavier, making it pretty difficult to handle day-to-day, meaning the smaller iPhone XS is the better option.The smallest, cheapest variant of Samsung’s current S10 line is still good, but falls slightly short of the high bar set by the regular Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e loses the optical zoom with only two cameras on the back, has a flat, slightly smaller screen and a lower capacity battery. It also ditches in the in-screen fingerprint scanner for one embedded in the power button – great for right-handed users but not so for the left handed.It doesn’t feel any smaller in the hand, but can be had for less if you must have a top-end Samsung for the lowest possible cost or dislike curved screens.The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best.Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 offers something a bit different, with long battery life, a massive screen and the all-important S Pen stylus. If you’re looking for a productivity powerhouse, the Note 9 is it. But it’s also huge with a slightly dated design.The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei’s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option.Huawei’s Honor brand has made a name for itself cut-price but good phones. The View20 is the best phone it has ever made and is cracking value at just £500.It has a top-of-the-line Huawei Kirin 980 processor (as seen in the Mate 20 Pro), a good-looking 6.4in FHD+ LCD screen, plenty of storage, 6 or 8GB of RAM, a super-quick fingerprint scanner on the back and it even still has a headphone socket. Standout features are a hole-punch notch in the screen, through which an excellent 25MP selfie camera pokes, and a really great 48MP camera on the back.Fast charging, long battery life, great in-hand feel and a wild light-reflecting V-shaped pattern in the glass back round out the highlights. Honor’s Magic UI 2, based on Android 9 Pie, is not quite as good as OnePlus’s OxygenOS, but at least you get two to three years of updates.Out of the two £500 top-end phones, buy the Honor View20 if you want a better camera buy the OnePlus 6T if you want a better user experience and software.The Pixel 3 is all about Google’s camera and software. The 5.5in OLED screen is small by 2019’s standards and has large bezels at the top and bottom, which make the phone bigger than it needs to be and give it a dated look.But Google’s fantastic single rear camera, excellent software and fast updates are worth buying into. Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak. Buy if you want a smaller phone and the Samsung Galaxy S10 isn’t for you.The larger Google Pixel 3 XL has everything that makes the Pixel 3 a really great phone, but is bigger with a huge notch at the top of the screen. It’s more difficult to handle than its smaller sibling and is more expensive, but has slightly better battery life. If you like the Pixel 3 but want a bigger screen, this is the phone for you, but on the whole the smaller version is a better device for most people. The Mate 20 Pro is a better big-screen phone all round.Xiaomi’s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section.Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn’t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options.Nokia 8 Sirocco – Good software but average design and camera – £600Razer Phone 2 - Gaming phone beast that falls down on camera performance – £500Sony Xperia XZ3 – Good, but not great phone that misses the mark – £699LG G7 – uninspiring design and software that’s not as good as rivals – £375 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

From aqua parks and windsurfing to mermaid classes and underwater hockey, here’s our pick of fun things to doBounce, hop, e and jump through Atlantis, a new aqua park at the National Diving and Activity Centre in Chepstow, Monmouthshire. It has five floating zones, each increasing in difficulty, with Total Wipeout-style courses of slides, climbing walls and obstacles (£30pp, under 8s not permitted). The centre also has a flyboarding experience on a water-propelled hover-board (£68pp, 16s and over). Elsewhere, two of the largest inflatable courses in the UK are the New Forest Aquapark (£15), near Frogham (4,000 sq m) and Lagoona Park (from £15pp), near Reading (5,000 sq m). Rutland Water, in the east Midlands (from £20pp), has the UK’s tallest inflatable obstacle, the Rutland Mammoth, with slides or a free fall 5.5-metre drop. Alongside its aqua park and aqua jungle, Windsor’s Liquid Leisure has a head-to-head race course inspired by the Ninja Warrior TV show (from £8pp).Against a backdrop of mountains and forests, Adventure Parc Snowdonia is an inland surf centre in north Wales, with manmade waves across beginner, intermediate and advanced zones (sessions from £35, wetsuit hire from £6 a day). For newbies, lessons are available for ages 5-plus (1½ hours, £40 children, £50 adult). It also has the new Adrenaline Indoors adventure centre, including climbing walls and artificial caving. Opening later in the year, the Wave in Bristol will include a lake with wave-making technology and be able to host 80 surfers at a time in six surfing zones. For more experienced surfers (and spectators), the tidal bore of the River Severn provides another alternative to ocean waves: reaching up to two metres high and more than 12mph as a result of the Atlantic surging into the Bristol Channel and through the estuary (there are several due in August).There’s a great variety of whitewater rafting options in the UK: from Olympic-standard parks to wildlife-rich rivers. For the latter, the River Blackwater on the Northern Irish border has a route with plenty of drops and rapids, but still suitable for beginners. Awol Outdoor Adventure runs instructor-led day trips from £35pp, including kit. One of the UK’s top manmade sites is the Lee Valley White Water Centre, the London 2012 venue. It runs Olympic-course rafting experiences from £39pp. The site also has hydrospeeding (a cross between a float and a bodyboard) around the smaller Legacy Loop (£45pp). Dam-fed waterways are another reliable year-round option: the Welsh National White Water Centre runs taster sessions on the River Tryweryn in Snowdonia, fed by the Llyn Celyn reservoir (£37pp, wetsuit hire £5).Single-fin swimming has become a popular new “sport”, teaching mermaids and mermen free-ing, synchronised swimming and underwater-breathing skills. Dorset’s coast was host to the first UK edition of the Merlympics last year, organised by the team from Mayim Mermaid Academy in Bournemouth – the UK’s longest-running mermaiding school. Its group mermaid lessons take place throughout the summer in Ferndown and Clayesmore (£45pp). Sister mermaid school, Finsplash in Norwich, has sessions every second Sunday (£30pp). Specially-made monofins are provided and sessions are for ages 8+ (but there’s no age limit currently Finsplash’s oldest mermaid is over 60).Canoe camping trips often mean access to secluded areas of the countryside and back-to-basics camping. Canoe the Wye runs a three-day, 42-mile canoe-and-camping adventure on the River Wye from Hereford to Symonds Yat. It explores the Forest of Dean and Wye valley, and includes stops at Hoarwithy and Ross-on-Wye (£195pp, half-day trips, from £60pp). On the Norfolk Broads, there are one- to four-night trips with The Canoe Man (from £188pp), some including a basic-but-atmospheric camping spot next to a wild-swimming site. In the Lake District, Keswick Adventures has a one-night tailor-made canoe expedition for £100pp, minimum of four people.Several of the UK’s many paddleboarding sites offer something a little different. Putting trust into a group of well-balanced friends would be wise for Inspire 2 Aventure’s paddleboarding sessions, in Monmouth, south Wales. Its giant paddleboard, the mega-SUP, has room for up to eight people, who navigate the river as a team (two hours, £25pp). After-dark adventures with Psyched Paddleboarding include head-torches and light-up boards for trips out into a sheltered bay around Anglesey, a designated Dark Skies Reserve (two hours, from £50pp, experience required).Wembury in south Devon is one of the UK’s top rockpooling spots. The Wembury Marine Centre runs sessions for all ages (£3pp) – and keep those eyes peeled for cushion starfish and spawning beadlet anemones. There are several free guided rockpooling sessions on the coast near St Michael’s Mount, in west Cornwall this summer, run by Great Scott! Adventures Outdoors (18 Aug, 1 Sept). Day trips with Coastal Foraging, in Carmarthenshire, include exploring mud flats, rock pools and estuaries around Pendine Sands and St Ishmael for wild ingredients, before cooking them over a fire in a sheltered sea cave (£80pp, £70 if travelling via public transport). ForeAdventure runs half-day seashore foraging courses in Studland on the Jurassic coast in Dorset (£40pp). It also has Forage and Feast sessions (three hours, £70pp), and Kayak, Fish, Forage and Feast (six hours, £120), both include three-course dinner with cocktails and wine. Wild About Pembrokshire runs a variety of family sea foraging courses, with guided walks, coastal picnics and more (from £15 adults, £5 children).West Sussex-based windsurfing and kitesurfing club 2Xs runs taster sessions from its West Wittering base (two hour windsurf tasters £55 ), and a Saturday club for children (7-12), which includes windsurfing, and other water sports (£35 for two hours). The Little Rippers Windsurfing course (for 5-7s) costs £65 for two hours. Scotland’s “sunshine” island of Tiree is one of the UK’s top windsurfing locations. Wild Diamond runs two-hour windsurfing courses here (children £30, adults £35) on flat, shallow Loch Bhasapol. Balinoe Campsite has pitches with views towards Mull and the Treshnish Isles – and a bothy and self-catering house for those reluctant to stay under canvas. Thanks to the exposed coast, the wide, sandy bay of Rhosneigr, on Anglesey’s western shore, is a great place to try windsurfing. FunSport runs lessons on the beach (weather dependent) for beginners, in groups of up to 4 people (£30pp) or one-on-one (£42.50).While Rome may look to ban visitors from taking a dip in its Trevi fountain, the UK has plenty of public paddling sites in cities where it’s possible to cool off for free. Among London’s most popular is Granary Square Fountain in King’s Cross, which is colourfully lit up in the evenings and choreographed to spurt at different heights then there is the Edmond J Safra fountain court in front of Somerset House, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Kensington Gardens, close to the Serpentine, and the V\u0026ampA’s John Madejski Garden Fountains, an oval lake with jets. Elsewhere, there’s Custom House pavement fountain in Belfast Sheffield’s award-winning Peace Gardens and the Mirror Pool in Bradford’s City Park, which is the UK’s largest urban water feature (welcoming paddlers, minus the fountain jets, which are due back on in October).Also known as underwater hockey, this water sport has clubs all over the UK and even its own governing body, the British Octopush Association. It was invented in the early 1950s by “sub-aqua ers in Southsea who got bored just swimming up and down pool lanes to get fit”. Equipment includes a mask, snorkel, fins and water polo hat. Players in teams of 10 hold a small stick in a gloved hand to push a 1.2kg puck into a tray at either end of a 25-metre pool. Most of the 120 BOA clubs in the UK run free taster sessions at local pools, including sessions for juniors.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Where are the drawbacks?Morning has broken, like the first morning, in Darvell, Sussex. The sun is shining, the air is full of birdsong and the scent of flowers. A bell rings and healthy-looking children, some barefoot, scamper happily off to school. The youngest are pushed around in wooden carts. Everyone is smiling and going about their business, taking washing to the central laundry or going to work in the workshops, offices or the kitchen garden. No one owns anything or earns anything. Everything is shared and everyone is very friendly. “Good morning,” they say, in a range of accents – British, American, some more Germanic-sounding ones among the older folk.And it does appear to be just that: a very good morning. Unless you take issue with the fact that the women here dress a bit like handmaids, with long shapeless skirts and head coverings (the men, mainly in plain jeans and shirts, look more contemporary, albeit untroubled by fashion). Or you’re bothered that same-sex relationships are a sin around here. Or perhaps you find it all a bit creepy or (whisper it) culty.I’m spending 24 hours with the Bruderhof, a radical Christian movement founded a century ago in Germany. In brief, it recognises the Bible’s authority over everything, placing emphasis on the New Testament’s Acts 2 and 4 and the Sermon on the Mount, which direct followers to embrace communal living and lifelong service to others. In its 100-year history, the group has moved around – Europe, Paraguay, North America – fleeing Nazis and wars. Now there are 3,000 or so living in communities worldwide, including some 300 here in the Weald. They have let the cameras in, for a BBC documentary, to show the world what they do. They might as well let the press in, too hence my presence.I am met at the station in a communal Volkswagen Golf by Bernard, 38, who might be called something like outreach director if the Bruderhof did titles. He lives with his wife, Rachel, 46, and their children, Esther, Michael and Jonathan (14, 12 and five) in a wing of the central building, which was once a TB hospital. I’m staying with them.For tea, after thanking the Lord, we have bacon rolls – from pigs raised on the premises – and salad, and they tell me about themselves. Rachel is from Connecticut, Bernard is British. They grew up and met within the community and were married in a field after a courtship that involved a lot of letter writing, discussion of the gospels and taking advice from pastors.They have had a couple of arguments in their time together. “One was about whether we should go for a walk when Esther was screaming as a baby,” says Rachel. That doesn’t sound too serious. “It was for us. It was devastating that we were arguing for the first time in our lives.”Rachel isn’t wearing a headscarf at home, just a long black skirt and a grey top. Does she not mind looking like a 19th-century peasant? “My identity isn’t defined by what I’m wearing, my freedom isn’t dictated by choosing the latest fashion of the high street,” she says. “What truly makes a woman free: is it choosing their clothing, or is it her personality and character?” She says she covers her head outside not because it’s the law laid down by men, but because Christ said she should when in prayer – and a lot of the day she is in prayer.But do the women look after the kids and chop the vegetables? Mostly, admits Rachel. “I don’t mind that I choose that as a Christian. My view is that men and women have different roles, but neither is superior.”There’s no TV in the house, no computers or tablets. What happens after tea? How about a gin and tonic? Oh, go on then! My kind of cul ... community. Bernard makes three large ones, and we have a quiz. Subject: life outside.Has 14-year-old Esther heard of Love Island? “Is that the one where they all go to the island and then they all have to sleep in a bed together?” Correct. She has never seen it, but a friend outside the community told her about it. Taylor Swift? Nope.Tory leadership, Trump, Brexit: all up to speed. “I think it’s really important to know what’s going on in the world,” says Rachel. “We are a part of it.” Brexit is going to affect them – the business exports, plus there may well be migration issues. “Celebrity culture is one of the things I’m perfectly happy my children know nothing about,” says Bernard. And Instagram. “The majority of parents I speak to are pretty unhappy about the effects of social media.”What about 12-year-old Michael. Would he like a TV? “A tiny bit, yeah,” he admits. He likes playing football, and sometimes gets to watch clips in the office, but doesn’t support a team.And Jonathan? At five, he can swim 500 metres in the community lake (which contains trout and carp). And he’s interested in the Antarctic, loves penguins. He sings a song about emperor penguins and everyone joins in: “To keep myself off the ice  I find my father’s feet are nice  I snuggle in his belly fluff  And that’s how I stay warm enough.” The Bruderhof do a lot of singing.I need to go to bed before I sign up. Up a wooden staircase into a comfortable room with a selection of German prayer books and a big bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk. They’re definitely trying to get me.I’m awoken by the braying of a donkey, and the sun. Breakfast is at 6.15 – more bacon, scrambled eggs, beans and a song. Then it’s off with Michael to feed Olivia the pig and her 12 piglets. Michael does it three times a day, willingly. I wonder if it would be possible to get my own boys to do something useful, three times a day, including before school? Ha! Not without material incentives.Michael likes doing it, he says. Perhaps he’s thinking ahead to when the pigs are feeding him. The Bruderhof may be pacifists, but they do enjoy their bacon.Now it’s my turn to work, in the workshop of Community Playthings, their company that designs and manufactures wooden classroom and play environments for schools and nurseries. Annual turnover is about £17m. I work with Bernard, assembling trapezoidal tables. “We’ll pay you the same as us: six-figure salary, all zeros,” says Bernard. Bit of a joker, is Bernard.Here’s Troy, who’s about to head off to Thailand to help Rohingya refugees. And Corwyn, putting together a table before opening his dentist’s surgery. And Jacob from Iraq, who used to be a Catholic, repented on the frontline in the war with Iran, became a secret pacifist, slyly not shooting anyone, and then fled Iraq just before the first Gulf war and eventually found home with the Bruderhof.No women in the workshop this morning? There will be some later, after nine, says Bernard. “So they can be at home, clean the house first.” He’s not joking, this time.I’m sent over to the polytunnels, to train tomatoes with a softly spoken man named Darius. He speaks like an American, but studied horticulture in Kent. It seems less important for the Bruderhof where they are from and more important that they are somewhere serving Christ. They get moved around depending on communities’ needs, so if Sannerz in Germany needs a builder or a doctor, and Spring Valley in Pennsylvania has a spare, they will move.Lunch is communal in the huge hall. But first, a song! I’m enjoying the singing, and the food, too – grilled chicken with rice. Beside me, five-year-old Jonathan happily eats his broccoli. How do they do that? Maybe he just doesn’t know that children don’t like greens.A letter is read out from a volunteer working with migrants on Mexico’s northern border. Then a few verses from John 3, which encapsulates what the Bruderhof are about. This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Down on the sports field, after the day’s work is done, there are communal games. I’m involved in a big game of kickball – basically rounders, only played with a football, which you kick. There are five-year-olds and 75-year-olds on my team, generations brought together by a shared vision. It’s a lovely scene – a bunch of people untroubled by money and mortgages and material matters, enjoying themselves and looking after each other.God (sorry), if I could just look past those issues – the homosexuality one, and the women looking like the one in Grant Wood’s American Gothic. Would it get claustrophobic, living and working with the same people, and with all that goodwill and kindness? I’d miss a bit of cynicism, gossip, a tiny bit of wickedness.But then I meet Bärbel and Rahel, sisters, aged 83 and 74, who are of German heritage but spent their childhood in Paraguay. It was tough there was never enough to eat. Now they have it too good, says Bärbel. Why aren’t they playing kickball? “Such a silly game,” scoffs Rahel. “I like to laugh at them when they make mistakes.”A hint of humour and defiance. It is possible.

When it opened in 2017, City officials insisted no inappropriate behaviour would be tolerated, a message reiterated on a sign at the entrance to the zone.But a number of naturists have complained their peace is being disturbed by the “reprehensible” actions of some non-nudists.One, Bernard, told Le Monde: “Voyeurs and exhibitionists come and bother the women … of course they are afraid.” He added: “Sometimes there’s a police unit that comes by but if they don’t catch anyone in flagrant délit, they can’t punish anyone.”Others complained of “perverts hiding in bushes”.The local mayor, Catherine Baratti-Elbaz, said police had been asked to increase park patrols after reports of “voyeurism and exhibitionism”, but the police commissioner, Hugo Arer, said he had not received any formal complaints this year.Laurent Luft, the president of the Paris Naturists’ Association, who was involved in choosing the Bois de Vincennes site as a naturist zone, said the problems were being exaggerated.“After I heard of these complaints I spoke to a male friend who goes to this naturist area every single day he told me he’d never seen any sordid activity or activities that don’t correspond to the idea of naturism,” he said.He admitted the experience might be different for women. “If I was a woman I’m not sure if I’d go there, but lots of my female friends do. Any nudist area like a beach, or even an ordinary beach where there are women in bikinis, will attract an element of frustrated men.”France is one of the world’s leading naturist destinations with 4.7 million nudists, 2.1 million of them French, according to the French Federation of Naturism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab05a948fcc75a920921b91c15598ae447867858/0_64_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a2ec57e20bda3af0806adc7e04d655d","title":"philippines libel trial of maria ressa journalist critical of president duterte begins","story":"Maria Ressa faces prison term if convicted under criminal cyberlibel lawA libel trial against the editor of Rappler, a Philippine news site critical of the regime of President Rodrigo Duterte, has begun in a case widely seen as an attempt by the government to intimidate journalists and curtail press freedom.Maria Ressa was arrested and held overnight in February on charges of cyberlibel for a story published by Rappler in 2012, before being released on bail. She described the charges as “preposterous and baseless”.In a statement on Tuesday, the first day of the trial, Ressa said: “This case of cyberlibel stretches the rule of law until it breaks.”She said: “How this is decided will have an impact on all Filipinos who post on Facebook – and of course, the quality of journalism in the digital age in the Philippines.”It was the eleventh time in 18 months that Ressa had been hit with criminal charges relating to Rappler, in what many believe is a targeted, government-led witch-hunt against the news organisation.Rappler, which is one of the most influential news sites in the Philippines, has also been one of the most critical of Duterte’s administration since he took power in 2016. In particular, it has scrutinised his government over the brutal war on drugs, which officially has taken more than 5,300 lives, though human rights groups allege the true figure is more than double that.In response, Duterte has repeatedly described Rappler’s journalism as “fake news” and his government has hit Rappler and Ressa with a multitude of criminal charges, ranging from being illegally foreign-owned, to tax evasion and failing to file tax returns, all of which Ressa says are “trumped up” and an attempt to attack and intimidate critical journalists.The cyberlibel charge relates to a story published on Rappler’s website in May 2012 that alleged ties between a Philippine businessman, Wilfredo D Keng, and a high court judge. However, as Ressa and her legal counsel have pointed out, the controversial cyberlibel law under which she is being prosecuted was enacted four months after the story was written.The cyberlibel case was first brought in 2017, but initially dismissed by the national bureau of investigation. However, despite no new evidence, it was mysteriously reopened in 2018 and allowed to proceed to trial by the department of justice (DOJ).Specifically in order to charge Ressa, the DOJ extended the liability period for cyberlibel cases from one to12 years.Tuesday’s brief hearing, which Ressa did not attend, ended after testimony from two minor witnesses who were brought in by the DOJ, with the case set to resume on 30 July.Ressa’s refusal to bow to pressure from the Duterte administration has won her accolades around the world. She was among those named Time person of the year 2018, and won the 2018 Knight International Journalism award and this year’s prestigious press freedom award, given by the Committee to Protect Journalists.This month it was also announced that Amal Clooney had joined the team defending Ressa against the charges. “Maria Ressa is a courageous journalist who is being persecuted for reporting the news and standing up to human rights abuses,” Clooney said in a statement.Over Duterte’s three years in power, press freedom has severely declined. Reporters Without Borders ranked the Philippines at 134 out of 178 countries in its press freedom index and its report cited at least three journalists who had been killed “most likely by agents working for local politicians”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Rejection of redevelopment to use biomass fuel casts doubt over 300 Bord na M\u0026oacutena jobsFriends of the Irish Environment had argued January 2019 regulations gave large scale projects an \u0026lsquoenforcement holiday\u0026rsquoUS coast guard member joins rescue as girl (6) falls off toy near Portmarnock beachHiqa report finds improvement in disability care centre sector over last five yearsTravel agents caution Irish tourists going to Europe where 40 degrees temperatures are forecastDUP and UUP welcome election of new Tory leader as SDLP and alliance voice concernsSettlement over birth at Sligo General Hospital made without admission of liability\u0026lsquoPluralist new Ireland won\u0026rsquot be built on narrow electoral win slipped through in period of chaos\u0026rsquoPassengers walking after bridge strike dismayed to see Dart start again without themJames McDonagh (28) faces charges of unlawful use of a car and dangerous drivingWarning issued for families to take care when visiting beaches and swimmingMan (20s) being treated for serious head injuries following assaultOne man in his early 20s is taken to hospital with minor injuries to his faceThe Amerigo Vespucci is the oldest ship in Italian navy and is used for training cadetsCompany says reliability of service affected by reduced number of driversMinister says he will consider options on the issue after criticism by Judge Peter CharletonOPW issues order as it is concerned messages left by visitors create privacy riskPeter Heathwood, campaigner for a pension for those injured in the Troubles, tells his storyStamps issued in commemorative set feature a misspelling of the Irish word for \u0026lsquomoon\u0026rsquoThe proposed Swords facility will have 40 beds and cater to public and private patients"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3964866.1563889257!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"offaly plant refused permission to keep burning peat after 2020","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe west Offaly power station, in Shannonbridge, Co Offaly, had sought permission to continue to burn peat past a December 2020 deadline until 2027, while it transitioned to rely on biomass fuel. File photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe west Offaly power station, in Shannonbridge, Co Offaly, had sought permission to continue to burn peat past a December 2020 deadline until 2027, while it transitioned to rely on biomass fuel. An Bord Pleanála refused permission for the Shannonbridge redevelopment due to the effects continuing peat burning would have on the climate. The planning board also criticised the “lack of information” around where Bord na Móna would source biomass. The board’s decision said an end to burning peat was a “key component within national climate and energy policy” to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Delivering biomass to the power plant “would give rise to unsustainable transportation movements on a substandard regional road network,” the decision said. The proposal would therefore be contrary to sustainable development in the area, the board said. Denis Naughten, Independent TD for RoscommonGalway, said the news was a “devastating blow to the whole region”, which would have “far reaching implications for thousands of jobs”.Environmental group An Taisce had objected to the development, due to the harmful impacts on the climate from continuing to burn peat up to 2027. The group also said the application was “premature” as Ireland did not have a national policy on the use of biomass supply. The Health Service Executive made a submission criticising the increased noise levels, if the plant was to rely entirely on deliveries of biomass. An Bord Pleanála’s environmental impact assessment was critical that “generating electricity from peat is now not a viable option from 2020”.The planner’s report said “based on the details provided in this application, there is no reliable biomass source available to feed the Shannonbridge plant”.The report said the application relied heavily on warnings of the negative economic impacts for the area if the plant had to close after 2020. DisappointmentMinister for Climate Action Richard Bruton expressed disappointment at the decision to refuse planning permission. “This was a plan for the future. We will have to see why this decision was made,” he told RTÉ Radio News at One. In a statement, a spokeswoman for ESB said the State-owned company was “disappointed” the application was rejected. “ESB will now carefully study the details of the decision,” she said. Willie Noone, secretary of the ESB Group of Unions, which represents plant workers, called on Mr Bruton to intervene in the matter. “Over 300 direct jobs are at risk, with hundreds more that indirectly rely on the operation of the power station also under threat,” Mr Noone said. “A ‘just transition’ does not entail throwing workers off an economic cliff edge with just the promise of a soft landing but little direct action,” he said. In recent days hundreds of workers from Bord na Móna’s Lanesborough peat plant, Co Longford, held a protest over planned job losses at the station."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3964704.1563885342!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tuesday weather temperatures to soar over 26 degrees","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             People enjoying the good weather on Portmarnock Beach in Dublin on Monday.

While there may be the occasional cloud and even misty patches near coasts where temperatures are likely to be be lower, the country is expected to bask in summer conditions. The forecast for the weekend, while featuring the odd shower on Saturday, is also for mainly dry days with good spells of sunshine and highs of 17 to 21 degrees. Sunday may see temperatures hit 22 degrees.It will be humid at night with an increasing risk of an isolated thundery shower breaking out. Lowest temperatures will be in the region of 13 to 16 degrees.Tomorrow, Wednesday, temperatures will fall back slightly but it will remain warm, with highs of 24 degrees in places - still blissful summer weather by traditional Irish standards. Some clouds may appear on Thursday which will see lower temperatures while Friday will be fresher as winds switch to westerly leading to highs of 16 to 20 degrees.Overall the outlook is for good sunshine over the weekend with some intermittent cloudy periods. Misty conditions may persist near the coast and temps will be lower.The good weather has brought warnings from water safety bodies for families to take care when visiting beaches and swimming. On Monday a six-year-old girl was dramatically rescued from the sea in Portmarnock, Co Dublin after she fell off a an inflatable lilo, having been blown out to sea by onshore winds.

The high temperatures which are expected to last just a few days should affect northern France, as well as parts of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Spokesman Pat Dawson said holidaymakers staying in affected areas to should stay hydrated throughout their stay. They should also avoid direct sunlight during the hottest periods of the day, he said. “We are encouraging all travellers to follow the advice of the local authorities which are implementing measures to tackle the extreme heat.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3964819.1563885027!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we need a statesman not a showman ni reaction to boris","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJeremy Hunt congratulates Boris Johnson after he was announced as the new Conservative party leader. Photograph: ReutersThere was initial mixed reaction in Northern Ireland to the election of Boris Johnson as the new British prime minister The DUP leader Arlene Foster offered her congratulations and said she looked forward to discussing with Mr Johnson the “shared objectives of strengthening the union, delivering Brexit and restoring devolution”.The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said Mr Johnson had the opportunity to “deliver the one thing that the country needs, which is to move beyond Brexit” and to get on with UK “domestic priorities”.The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that the election of Mr Johnson was a “worrying step toward a hard no-deal Brexit and a hard border in Ireland”. “Johnson has coasted into Downing Street on a wave of Brexit bluff and bluster. It won’t be long until he crashes into the rocky reality that the European Union will not sacrifice the interests of Ireland to appease a man who has lied and slandered its institutions in an effort to secure power,” he said. ‘Fragile complexities’Added Mr Eastwood, “All parties in the North must now set our combined efforts to resisting the impulse of this administration to drive off the Brexit cliff edge. The fragile complexities of political and economic relationships across this island cannot be placed on the altar of British nativism. Our struggle for peace and economic normalisation has been too long and too hard to be sacrificed for this.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann in congratulating Mr Johnson said he now faced “enormous responsibilities”.“There is now immense expectation as to the next steps the new prime minister will take and one of those must be the restoration of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly,” he said. “The Ulster Unionist Party is willing and able to work with Mr Johnson to ensure this happens but if that is unattainable in the short term, then he must move to ensure further critical decisions are taken by Westminster,” he added. Mr Swann said the bottom line for Mr Johnson was “that any decisions he takes must be in the best interests of all of the United Kingdom and that includes doing everything possible to avoid a no-deal Brexit”. He added, “I urge him not to allow nationalism in Northern Ireland or Scotland to exploit the current instability for selfish political interests.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said what was required in the incoming prime minister was a “statesman, not a showman”.“It is now vital as he takes up the reins as prime minister he demonstrates a level of leadership and seriousness which has been lacking to date. At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead,” she said. ‘Half-truths’She added, “Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefitting. With an impending no deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.”Ms Long said that do date Mr Johnson had “failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario - needs that require more than merely a ‘can do’ attitude to resolve”.She warned, “The Irish Border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreement if mishandled.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Mr Modi announced last year that ISRO would execute a manned space mission by 2022 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of India\u0027s independence.The Chandrayaan-2 mission will cost £120 million, while the manned mission will reportedly require the ISRO\u0027s funding to be increased dramatically from £1.3 to £4 billion.Critics have questioned India\u0027s space ambitions, arguing that it is an inappropriate way to spend money in a nation that receives financial assistance, and where millions of people struggle with crippling poverty, malnutrition and crumbling infrastructure.      “India is a competent event manager capable of undertaking inidual projects efficiently, but incapable of sustaining any long term developmental endeavours,” said Seema Mustafa of the Centre for Policy Analysis in New Delhi. Students wave Indian national flags to celebrate the launch of Chandrayaan-2She added that such overreach was typical of all successive governments that prided themselves on registering milestones rather than providing hundreds of millions of Indians with food, clean water, power, health, education and employment.Officials stoutly defended the mission, saying scientific research could not be compartmentalised. Yesterday, the mood at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India\u0027s east coast, was jubilant.“After a technical snag, we bounced back with flying colours,” said ISRO chairman Kailasavaoo Sivan after takeoff. He was referring to the earlier countdown on 15 July being halted 56 minutes before its scheduled blast-off following a snag in which a helium gas bottle in the rockets cryogenic engine was reportedly found to be faulty. Mr Sivam said the glitch was fixed within 48 hours. Launched aboard the domestically developed Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III, the 640 ton spacecraft is due to touch down on the moon after a 48-day journey on 6 September to begin its investigative missions, officials said.The launch was broadcast live on television channels across the countryIt will also be first such mission to the moon’s south pole to map its topography and look for water.   And if successful, it would make India the fourth country after China, Russia and the US to execute a ‘soft’ controlled landing on the moon and deploy an investigative rover onto its surface. Chandrayaan-2 - Sanskrit for moon vehicle - comprises three distinct parts: the ‘orbiter’ with a mission life of one year built to take images of the lunar surface and ‘sniff’ the atmosphere, and the lander - named Vikram, after ISRO’s founder - which carries within its belly a six-wheeled rover to analyse the lunar soil. In its 14-day life the rover is capable of travelling 550 yards from the lander and sending data and images back to earth for analysis. “India can hope to get the first selfies from the lunar surface once the rover gets going,” Mr Sivan said before the aborted July 15 mission.  The mission involves some 1,000 engineers, scientists and technicians and is led by two women Muthaya Vanitha, programme director, and Ritu Karidhal, mission director.India\u0027s first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, which launched in 2008, did not land on the moon, but carried out the most detailed search for water on it using advanced radar technology. Six years later India successfully launched a data and image gathering mission to Mars to determine how Martian weather systems function.UK weather: Heatwave temperatures to soar above 30 degrees as Britain heads for its hottest nightThe inside story of how Boris Johnson defeated Jeremy HuntLi Peng, the \u0026#39Butcher of Beijing\u0026#39, dies aged 90 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s charisma will open doors in Trump\u0026#39s Washington but the same policy pitfalls awaitComment: Boris, the country is crying out for leadership -

But the Met Office say it could remain as high as 24C (75.2F) on Tuesday night for parts of South East England.Night-time temperatures are measured by taking the minimum temperature across a 24-hour period, as the lowest point tends to fall during the early hours of the morning. During the day, parts of south-east England could reach as high as 34C on Tuesday, and the mercury will continue to rise as the week rolls on. By Thursday, the all-time UK temperature record of 38.5C recorded in Faversham in August 2003 could be under threat. It is expected to reach at least 37C in the south east of England, which would beat the current July record of 36.7°C set at Heathrow in 2015.Heatwaves should be named in the same way as winter storms to better warn people of the dangers of sweltering heat, it has been urged.The Government\u0027s advisory Committee on Climate Change recently warned that the UK was not prepared for a future of more heatwaves, with more action needed to prevent overheating in homes, hospitals and schools, and that even vulnerable people did not consider themselves at risk.Last summer\u0027s heatwaves led to 863 excess deaths, Public Health England has estimated.Bob Ward, director of policy at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said the Met Office should start naming heatwaves, like it has for winter storms since 2015, to help warn people about severe weather.Commuters cross London Bridge as temperatures soarMr Ward said: Far more people have died from recent heatwaves than from storms, so it should be uncontroversial to start applying names to both.The Government and its agencies, including the Met Office, must lead the way in communicating the growing dangers of heatwaves and other impacts of climate change, so that the British public are better informed and can protect themselves.In 2015, the Met Office started to name storms that were likely to have a significant impact in order to “aid the communication of approaching severe weather”.Heatwaves do not currently receive official names, though a heatwave across parts of Europe during summer 2017 was nicknamed ‘Lucifer’.Should heatwaves be named like storms? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Cambridgeshire Constabulary have been called out to two incidents today of dogs left in cars by their owners. On both occasions the dogs\u0027 owners returned and were given stern words of advice by an officer. A spokeswoman for Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: “So far this month we have had 14 calls relating to dogs being left in hot cars, including the above three yesterday and today – thought to be two of the hottest days of the year so far.“If it’s 22 degrees outside, the temperature inside a car can reach 47 degrees within the hour.“Our message can\u0027t be much clearer - dogs die in hot cars. Please never leave your dog in the car on a hot day. If you see a dog in distress in a hot car, call 999.”The RNLI sent out a Tweet warning people in the UK and Ireland about jumping into cold water to cool off during the heatwave.They said: Water temperatures are still low enough to cause cold water shock, which can leave you panicking and gasping for air. If you do get into trouble, you need to #FloatToLive. The Badger Trust have said you should leave out bowls of water for thirsty visitors, including this badger who took a dip in an attempt to cool down.Hedgehogs may also come looking for water, leave a bowl out for them to ensure they stay hydrated. Some weather forecasts are universal, to a degree, but even in this most extraordinary of weeks there are points of contention between different institutions. The Met Office and the BBC seem to believe that the skies will be clear until showers on Friday. Norwegian app Yr is predicting light showers amid searing heat on Thursday afternoon. But AccuWeather is forecasting a thunderstorm as early as Wednesday morning, followed by a clear Thursday and more thunder on Friday.So who to trust? And why are they so different anyway?

Rainless days multiplied and temperatures climbed, finally reached a pitiless 35.9 degrees in Cheltenham. You can share your memories of summers past in the comments below.  The Environment Agency is deploying drones to catch anyone thinking about stealing water from rivers and lakes. The decision comes after last years hot and dry summer prompted some farmers in rural areas to abstract water illegally for their crops, the Government department has said. The 2019  rising temperatures had seen a corresponding rise in the pilfering of water.A drone in the sky Andrew Chapman, Environment Planning Specialist for the Environment Agency in East Anglia, said: This will be the first time we have ever used drones for this purpose. The majority of irrigators do operate within their licence conditions. However, last year a minority of farmers did not play by the rules and severely restricted other people\u0027s ability to irrigate their crops.A third party would be employed to operate the drone, a spokesman for the Environment Agency said, which connected to a web portal, so that an Environment Agency staff member can view the images from a computer and direct the device to fly over certain locations.The spokesman added: If irrigators are found to be abstracting illegally, enforcement action will be taken. This can include written warnings, civil sanctions, referral to the Rural Payments Agency or prosecution.Network Rail have launched specialist teams to asses their railways and ensure passenger safety as temperatures are expected to soar.Their \u0027extreme weather action teams\u0027 (EWATs) will visit locations across the country to asses the impact of the rising temperatures on the UK\u0027s rail network. Network Rail tracks have a stress-free temperature of 27C, but the mercury set to rise to 38C in parts of south east England on Thursday. When the steel tracks heat up they can expand and buckle, so speed restrictions must be put in place to ease the pressure.Network Rail have said they will advise if any restrictions will be enforced.James Nattrass, director of incident management, at Network Rail said: “Keeping passengers safe and moving are our top priorities during this heatwave. That’s why we sometimes have to put speed restriction on to prevent our rails, that can be over 20oC higher than air temperatures, from buckling which can derail a train and cause huge delays.”Shelter, the housing and homelessness charity has issued five tips for helping someone you see sleeping rough during the hot weather. From offering food, water, hats, sunglasses and sun cream to speaking to your local council, you can check out their advice below. With record temperatures set to be reached this week, Dementia UK, the provider of specialist dementia support, has updated its guidance on how to keep a person with dementia safe during hot weather. Due to communication difficulties a person with dementia may not be able to explain that they’re dehydrated or feeling unwell because of the heat.They could also forget to wear loose, cool clothing as well as hats and sunglasses. Dr. Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and CEO at Dementia UK offers updated guidance on looking after your loved ones this week: Arrange for friends, neighbours or relatives to provide extra checks on a person with dementia. They should be aware of the possible signs to look out for including: headaches, dizziness, increased confusion, pale and sweaty skin as well as excessive thirst. Always seek medical advice if you have concerns.Dehydration can be a big issue for a person with dementia as they may not remember to drink fluids throughout the day. Ensure that any cups or glasses are nearest to the hand they write with and they can easily see them. Try not to include pieces of fruit within the water as this can sometimes be confusing and off-putting for a person with dementia. If the person prefers to drink fruit squashes add this to the water as this can make it more appealing for the person and easier for them to see. Regularly prompting the person to drink can also prevent dehydration.Some medication can be affected by a person’s dehydration and this may lead to a drop in blood pressure. This can lead to falls or fainting. You can avoid this by keeping track of when the person with dementia takes their medication. Sticking to the same schedule every day and ensuring the medication is taken with water is advisable.Sometimes a person with dementia may get confused with what clothing to wear during the heat. They may wear fleeces, thick coats or jackets instead of cool and loose fitting clothing. In situations like this, you can look at buying a similar style of clothing made out of a much thinner natural fabric.There can also be cases where someone with dementia refuses to change their clothes during long periods of heat. This can result in personal hygiene issues and even infections. Sometimes people with dementia like to have a routine such as wanting to wear the same clothes all the time. To maintain good standards of hygiene, you can buy multiple sets of the same clothing and the dirty clothing can then be removed when the person goes to bed at night. The next morning, you can lay out a clean set of clothing ready for them to wear.Dr Hayo added: “Our Admiral Nurses specialise in practical advice to help people with dementia and their families get the best quality of life. For more information, call our Admiral Nurse Dementia Helpline on 0800 888 6678.Across the UK people will likely find themselves feeling a little uncomfortable as they head to bed tonight. Leading sleep expert, James Wilson, aka The Sleep Geek offers solutions for those unbearable nights.  Ensure there is a good airflow through the house. Open windows on both sides to allow the air to pass through.Close blinds and curtains in rooms that are exposed to direct sunlight. The shade will help the room stay cooler.Have a lukewarm bath or shower before bed to encourage your core temperature to drop, or alternatively put lukewarm water in a hot water bottle and place the soles of your feet on it.If using a fan, place a bowl of chilled water in front of it to cool the stream of air it\u0027s pushing around the room.Don’t put bedding or pyjamas in the fridge-freezer, funnily enough, some people do this (although who has a freezer big enough to put a duvet in?). It will add more moisture to your sleep environment and that moisture will heat up and make you even warmer.If you are using  a cotton sheet ensure it is as low a thread count as possible as the higher the thread count, the less breathable it is. Cotton is ok in hot weather, although it isn’t that great at wicking the moisture away I would suggest using bamboo. It has longer fibres so breathes better and doesn’t lint so people with skin conditions are not as aggravated – it is also lighter on the body.Finally don’t worry too much about it. The biggest thing that prevents us from sleeping in hot weather is the thought “I am too hot to sleep”. My advice would be to accept that you might not sleep quite as well, but that it will probably be over in a couple of days and your body will more than likely make up for it by giving you better quality sleep once the temperature drops.Sunbathers apply sunscreen on Towan beach in Newquay, Cornwall last week Take a quick glance around your office this week and you may spot a few telltale signs of the heatwave Britain is currently basking in extra freckles, t-shirt tans and reddy brown shoulders. All from a few harmless days spent out in the sunshine, right?Wrong. “While a small percentage of the population are dutifully applying sun cream every time they head out in the sun, the vast majority of the UK are taking every opportunity to bake themselves, entirely oblivious to the damage they\u0027re inflicting upon their skin,” says consultant dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe, a professor of dermatology at UCLA in California. “Mostly because they believe it won’t really do them any harm.”Maria Lally takes a look at how you can protect your skin during this week\u0027s rays.  While wet t-shirt competitions may not be your style there are more subtle ways to keep cool this week. Try soaking a pair of socks in cold water or eating a spicy curry. We\u0027ve rounded up our favourite tricks that will keep you from breaking a sweat during the heatwave.  Just whatever you do, don\u0027t try to fan yourself. UK heatwave | The dos and don\u0026#039tsThe latest Department for Transport statistics show 2,324 vehicle collisions a year are caused by dazzling sun, of which 449 are serious and 25 fatal.So if your great summer getaway starts today - here\u0027s what to do to avoid becoming a statistic, according to LeaseCar.UK.  Use the visors: Sun visors are there to block dazzling sunlight and provide safer driving conditions, so remember to make full use of yours when necessary – including on the passenger side of your car. On most vehicles they can also unclip and spin 90 degrees to shield side windows, in case the sunlight is coming from a different direction.Slow down: If the sun, or any other weather conditions, are affecting your vision behind the wheel and ability to travel safely, it’s vital to drive slower. This allows you a greater reaction time should a problem arise and offers an opportunity to consider if, when and where it’s worth pulling over, to wait for conditions to improve.Back off: If glare from sunshine is reducing visibility on the road, it’s wise to leave an increased following distance to the vehicle in front of you. Struggling to see other cars’ actions could be extremely hazardous, but allowing additional time and space to interpret the road ahead should reduce the risk of danger.Clean inside and out: Before setting off on a journey on a bright summer’s day, make sure your windscreen and mirrors are completely clean and free from smears or dirt that could be made highly visible and obstructive with direct sunlight shining on them. Keep screen wash topped up too. Removing clutter from the dashboard could also aid drivers vision and safety when travelling in potentially dazzling sun, as materials such as paper, glass and food packaging can reflect sunlight and cause problems. Give surfaces a wipe as well.Fix cracks: Any cracks, scratches or pits on your windscreen or even your bonnet could cause sunlight to scatter and distort your view of the road. Before driving in summery conditions, ensure your vehicle is in top shape and invest in a professional once over if you have any doubts.Get glasses: A pair of polarised glasses could help reduce the sun’s glare and improve your safety on the roads this summer without the darkening effect of traditional sun glasses. Polarised lenses contain a filter that blocks out intense reflected light, making them an ideal aid to driving in potentially dazzling weather conditions and worth keeping in your vehicle at all times.A heatwave is a prolonged period of abnormally hot weather, but the thresholds vary from place to place. In the majority of Wales, the south-west and north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, this threshold is 25C, for the Midlands, south-east Wales, and parts of the south-west, it is 26C, the home counties and the south-east of England\u0027s threshold is 27C and for London it is 28C. When the temperature reaches these thresholds and stay there for three days - it is considered a heatwave. The Met Office explains in further detail in this video:If, like me, you struggled to sleep last night, here are a few tips that might help you beat the burn tonight. Have any nuggets of advice?

Asda announced earlier this month that the service would be rolled out to 50 stores by the end of this year.Amazon takes on Uber with investment in food delivery firm DeliverooSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe failed to seal a £12bn mega-merger with Asda that he hoped would give the two supermarket chains the scale to confront challenges they face from all sides.The company\u0027s sales have been falling amid fierce competition from delivery apps and discount stores while further trouble could be ahead with online giants like Amazon making steps into the groceries market.Sainsbury’s sales dropped 1.2 per cent in its latest quarter despite large price discounts across a range of products.Clodagh Moriarty, Sainsbury’s chief digital officer said he\u0026nbsprecognised shoppers’ growing desire for convenience.\u0026nbsp“We’re excited to see what our customers think before deciding if, how and where we go next with the offer,” Ms Moriarty\u0026nbspsaid.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This forecast was based on a type of a no-deal Brexit, outlined by the IMF, that assumes no border disruptions. The fund’s more severe scenario incorporates significant border disruptions that increase Britain’s import costs.On another point, NIESR appears to be in greater agreement with the OBR: the think tank said there is a 25 per cent chance that the economy is already in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The OBR also said last week that the UK may be slipping into “a full-blown recession”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two bodies providing closely watched forecasts, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Office for Budget Responsibility, have in recent days warned of such a possibility. \u0026nbspThe CBI survey showed that manufacturing activity was expected to pick up over the next three months, with the output balance rising to +6 per cent.\u0026nbspHowever, investment plans for the next 12 months weakened. Uncertainty about future demand was the most-cited reason but labour shortages were also a concern.“With orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it’s crucial for the new prime minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline – and get on with pressing domestic priorities from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy,” Ms Newton-Smith said. \u0026nbsp“This will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.”The CBI interviewed 291 firms between 25 June and 15 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is not expected to happen until iOS 13, which was unveiled earlier this summer and will be fully released in September, but is available in an early version now.Instead, the new update brings a host of small tweaks and security updates intended to make iPhones and iPads safer.However, hiding beneath those relatively mundane updates are two features that could change the way iPhone users interact with their phones.First among them is a new iPhone migration tool, which is intended to help people when they get a new phone.

References to the Apple Card have been found in the beta version of iOS 12.4, and so the release of this version is expected to bring those same changes.That could mean that the card – which was unveiled in March without a release date – could finally be coming to the public. Until now, Apple has only offered the option to sign up to receive updates in the future.As well as the new changes, the latest update also brings back the Walkie-Talkie feature to the Apple Watch. That was pulled earlier this month when it was discovered that the Watch could be used to listen in on people, but that problem appears to have been fixed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become.

One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed.

How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood.

How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise.

What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original?

How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more.

How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released.

How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore.

How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok.

SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourRidley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic.

Some of those variants are very beneficial for adapting to their lifestyle in the north.\u0026nbspHowever, it also means they could be more at risk from certain diseases if they develop western diets and lifestyles.”One example is their predisposition for having high levels of cardiovascular disorders and a propensity to having brain aneurysms. Aneurysms occur when the wall of an artery in the brain weakens and can\u0026nbsprupture, causing a potentially fatal haemorrhage.\u0026nbspUntil now, the genetic background of this population, which is made up of around 3,000 iniduals, was badly understood as they live far from scientific research centres.\u0026nbspTiny 4.2m-year-old monkey discovery casts new light on evolutionWhy it’s time we stopped human evolutionBone thought lost to evolution making mystery return in humansScientists from The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital) of McGill University analysed the genetic characteristics of 170 Inuit volunteers from Nunavik, a region of northern Quebec.\u0026nbspDr Dion said: “It was already known they were more at risk but now we have a genetic explanation.”Until 100 years ago the Nunavik population had not mixed outside their group for thousands of years. Now between 10 to 15 per cent of the population have genes from elsewhere.\u0026nbspIsolated non-European populations living in remote parts of the world are often underrepresented or completely absent from genetic studies and understanding their genetic makeup will help medical experts deliver better services for them.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspGuy Rouleau\u0026nbspfrom McGill University, the study’s senior author said: “In the case of the Nunavik Inuit, our results emphasise the need to provide effective neurological services.\u0026nbspFuture research will build on the findings to determine if these unique genetic traits increase risk of aneurysm, and if so, what interventions can be designed to reduce this risk”.The study was done with approval from Nunavik Nutrition and Health Committee in Kuujjuaq, Nunavik.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That wonky amount of interest threatens to eclipse the way we think about the moon and space exploration more generally.This was the week that the Indian space agency sent a mission that should be the first time the country will\u0026nbspconduct\u0026nbspa soft landing onto the lunar surface. And while that achievement will be a rare one, it won’t be unique: India\u0026nbspwill become the fourth country to do so, after the\u0026nbspUS, the\u0026nbspformer Soviet Union\u0026nbspand China.The moon landing anniversary received far more attention, but the US didn’t actually do anything new to merit all of the excitement. Getting to the lunar surface is of course an achievement – it might be\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspachievement of human history – but it is also one that happened 50 years ago, in another age.The week was filled up with some new announcements about the US government and Nasa’s plans to head back to the moon, including an announcement by Mike Pence that the Orion capsule that could one day carry astronauts back to the lunar surface is ready for final testing. But those are just promises, and the frenzied excitement threatens to obscure what is really happening today, and in the future.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - June 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A coronal mass ejection as seen by the Chandra Observatory.

It gets to fundamental questions of who owns the moon, and how we should treat the new place we come across.The moon will be an incredibly valuable resource in years to come: not only does it remain a valuable object of study in itself, it is likely to serve as a stopping-off point that could make travel further into the solar system much easier. As such, it will become yet another resource for the world to fight over.As the space race hots up, that fighting is likely to rhyme with the bloody\u0026nbsphistory of colony and empire. The US seems to believe it ought to have supremacy\u0026nbspbillionaires are eyeing it as a possible escape from the dangers at home –\u0026nbspclimate change –\u0026nbspwhich threaten\u0026nbspall of Earth.How Nasa plans to put a US flag on Mars by 2033Other launches like those from China and India offer a way out of this depressing repetition, as the world fights to control valuable resources all over again. It is worth turning our attention to those other space agencies – in the hope that this time around it could be different.It would be a mistake, however, to think that having different countries in the race mean it will go any differently: it is just as likely that this time around we have different countries fighting, but all to the same selfish and rapacious ends. We should be even more ambitious, and try and change the race rather than the runners.I despair over how little has changed since the moon landingBoris Johnson claims moon landing proves he can deliver BrexitThe moon landing means everything to aspiring astronauts like meNasa and Apollo veterans are helping the push back to the moonRather than history and the achievements of decades gone by, we might do better to think a little more about science fiction. Authors like Becky Chambers have shown that, in her words, space is for everyone Kim Stanley Robinson has written about the\u0026nbspdangers of trying to ignore that fact and simply recreating our current geopolitical difficulties on a new world.The moon is an unbelievable, magic, alien world that offers the opportunity to change how we live and what we value. But so far it looks as if we are treating it with the same combination of acquisitiveness and disregard that the western world has treated any other place that could be a\u0026nbsppossible colony.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This forecast was based on a type of a no-deal Brexit, outlined by the IMF, that assumes no border disruptions. The fund’s more severe scenario incorporates significant border disruptions that increase Britain’s import costs.On another point, NIESR appears to be in greater agreement with the OBR: the think tank said there is a 25 per cent chance that the economy is already in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The OBR also said last week that the UK may be slipping into “a full-blown recession”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two bodies providing closely watched forecasts, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Office for Budget Responsibility, have in recent days warned of such a possibility. \u0026nbspThe CBI survey showed that manufacturing activity was expected to pick up over the next three months, with the output balance rising to +6 per cent.\u0026nbspHowever, investment plans for the next 12 months weakened. Uncertainty about future demand was the most-cited reason but labour shortages were also a concern.“With orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it’s crucial for the new prime minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline – and get on with pressing domestic priorities from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy,” Ms Newton-Smith said. \u0026nbsp“This will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.”The CBI interviewed 291 firms between 25 June and 15 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the crunch is coming for these wreckers.Theresa May’s deal is dead, rejected three times. If the EU still refuses to rewrite it, No Deal it must be — as both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt accept.The choice will be that or No Brexit.And the Cabinet Remainer duds and no-mark ministers, all ready to quit instantlyBoris becomes PM, are idiotsthey think that No Brexit ends happily for them, their party or Britain.The Tories must be pro-Brexit, in whatever form necessary. There is no choice. Helpfully, the EU’s new federalist leader is already making it more toxic to Brits by the minute.So Tory Remainers must wake up to this stark choice:It’s Brexit, with No Dealneed be, or No Brexit, no Tories . . . and Marxism.WE always said No Deal could be bumpy.Our economy will take a short-term hit. So will Ireland’s and the continent’s. Jobs will be lost.But what alternative is therethe EU and the Irish PM refuse to confront reality and make the deal palatable And taking as gospel the official forecast of a year-long recession costing £billion neglects three crucial things:That will need a dynamic new Chancellor. The existing one, Philip Hammond, is too busy shamefully betraying his own Government and scorching the earth for the incoming regime.If No Deal IS a disaster, his miserable defeatism will be partly to blame.THE BBC’s betrayal of old folk becomes yet more sickening.Not content with stripping them of their free licence while paying millions to the likes of Gary Lineker, it intends to send out enforcers to demand the cash.These goons hammering on the doors of traumatised and confused OAPs are absurdly described as an “outreach team” carrying out a “support visit”.But the BBC’s self-harm doesn’t stop there. It turns out its breach of the funding deal with the Government will trigger a stampede of pension credit claims to qualy for an exemption from the fee.Cost to taxpayers . . . £.billion.This PM has given up. Her successor must not let the greedy, wasteful BBC fleece pensioners or taxpayers. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So let’s not pretend I don’t need the show every bit as much as the Love Islanders deserve the low-grade abuse contained in this quiz, whichtests just how closely you’ve been watching.

I always wondered why an Englishman would want to buy a house in Overkalix. This is a very quiet and secluded community.”Beech had evaded UK cops but knew a criminal trial was pending.Patrik went on: “One day he came in ranting we were taking too long. He was furious, very rude and aggressive. I had to send another workman to calm him.”He said he then “vanished like a ghost”, ignoring repeated requests to pay, adding: “I can’t afford to lose this kind of money.”Carpenter Pär Andersson, , is owed £, for “a lot of work” on the bathroom, corridor and bedrooms. He said: “It seemed very strange he was here.“We’ve had people from other countries move here, but never an Englishman of his age. He said he had been to Overkalix on holiday and fell in love with it.“At some point his mother came and she wanted us to build her a luxury cabin. She wanted us to go ahead with it straight away.” But Pär said it cost £, and Beech had to settle the original bill first.He went on: “I was right to be cautious. It will be very dficult to get my money back.”Beech used ious names to hide his identity, including Andersson, Karlsson and Oskar — and posted updates on his “business”.He wrote in February: “Follow us on an exciting journey to create  Degrees North bed and breakfast in the heart of Swedish Lapland.”Future guests were invited to “see the ious activities you can do and meet the local wildle”, including lynx, moose and reindeer. He added: “When we open, come and stay, see for yourself.”On April  he wrote: “The Northern Lights have been dancing around the sky for the last three nights. Just amazing every time you see them, so lucky.”He also quipped on another occasion: “I don’t need therapy, I just need Sweden.”On April  he posted pictures of a bonfire festival in Overkalix, writing: “Great to see a thriving community spirit.”He also thanked neighbour Christina Gäversten-Stål for “making me feel so welcome”. She told The Sun: “He seemed very polite and I tried to introduce him to the local community.“Then one day he said he was going with a friend to Norway on holiday, and never came back. I was shocked when I heard what he was accused of.”Beech, who was taking Swedish lessons, also introduced himself as Oskar to an Italian traveller, Claudio Comi.Claudio, who helped Beech redecorate his cottage, posted some pictures of the property on Facebook. But Beech refused to pose for any photos himself, telling him: “I never have my picture taken.”Claudio said: “We kind of guessed he was not who he was telling us he was.”Another neighbour, Sonja Isaksson, recalled: “He seemed nice.“He said he wanted to buy more property and make this a tourist destination. Then we started seeing an unmarked police car watching the house.”Property records show Beech bought a second property in Kiruna,  miles from Overkalix, but is thought to have never visited it.He feared the net was closing in on him in August, and fled. He checked in to several cheap hostels in the Swedish city of Gothenburg under  names. He was eventually arrested at its central train station on October .Vincent Van Uytven, who runs a holiday resort in Overkalix, was the only local to hear from Beech after his disappearance.He messaged Vincent on August : “I’m just dealing with a few things and getting stressed.”THE mum of a lad who was spied on by Carl Beech said of the paedo: “He’s sick.”The pervert had rigged up a camera to make footage of the boy using the toilet.Beech stored the video on his computer so he could watch it over and over again — alongside hundreds of child abuse images.The mum of the teenager who was filmed said: “Carl was a governor of two schools, had been an NHS nurse and was a single parent. He was trusted.“There weren’t any warning signs that he was a danger.“To me, he was a good dad. That was the impression he gave. There was nothing unusual. I never had any concerns.“The first time I knew anything was wrong was when CID said they had found images of my son on his phone and laptop. When I saw the pictures, reality set in. There were images of my son in his underwear and one of him using the toilet.”She added: “It has really affected my son. He’s withdrawn and will not talk about it.“They need to lock up Carl and throw away the key. I thought I could trust him. He isn’t what you think.

Alter course to  degrees immediately, over.After that, HMS Montrose can be heard telling the ships crew: This is British warship F.I reiterate, that as you are conducting transit passage in a recognised international strait, under international law your passage must not be impaired, impeded, obstructed or hampered.The frigate then asks the Iranian vessel to confirm it is not intending to violate international law by attempting to board the tanker, in the recording obtained by security firm Dryad Global.Moments later, Iranian special forces stormed the ship by abseiling down from a helicopter.Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, said that HMS Montrose had been an hour away from the Impero, too far to physically stop the seizure.Montrose is the only warship Britain has in the Gulf to cover the -mile strait.However, the government has not arranged fixed times at which civilian vessels from the UK could sail through the Strait under the protection of the frigate, as it has done previously to guard against Somali pirates.It can also be revealed that in April Britain withdrew two Royal Navy Wildcat helicopters, which were based close by in Oman and provided surveillance of the Strait for hostile Iranian activity.It said at the time they were “no longer needed”.A nuclear-powered submarine and Royal Marine Commandos could now be sent to bolster Navy defences in the Gulf.The moves were discussed at emergency meetings of the Government’s Cobra security committee after Friday’s hijacks.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Iran it was choosing a “dangerous path” with its “totally unacceptable” actions in the Gulf.He said he had spoken to Iran’s foreign minister to voice his “extreme disappointment”.Last night Mr Hunt announced he had raised the maritime threat level to “level three” — or “critical.”The Tory leadership candidate is expected to use a Commons statement today to announce a package of diplomatic and economic measures.The UK could also push for EU and UN sanctions to be reimposed on the regime after they were lted in  as part of a deal on Irans nuclear programme.The UK and the EU have so far shown a willingness to help Iran ease the impact of sanctions reimposed by the US last year after President Trumps decision to withdraw from the deal.Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood today warned the Royal Navy is too small to protect British ships from Iran.He also threatened to freeze the countrys assetsit doesnt release the UK tanker.Askedthe drastic move was being considered, Mr Ellwood said: Cobra was taking place yesterday, so were looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast heatwave hottest day ever","story":"Today the UK will bake in highs of C as an African heatwave with sweltering humidity sweeps the UK for the first week of the school holidays.An amber heat alert - the second-highest level - has been issued for the east and south east of England as well as the East Midlands.The Met Office has also issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms for most of the UK from pm tonight until am tomorrow.Scattered thunderstorms are predicted to move north leading to potential power cuts and travel delays by tomorrow morning.Boiling air originating from Africa will sweep over France and Spain and across Britain through the next  hours from tomorrow.It will arrive laden with sand from the Sahara Desert and smoke from fires currently ravaging swathes of Portugal, forecasters say.Temperatures are expected to rocket past the C mark before the end of the week, smashing summer heat records.Hot weather could largely hold out through the rest of summer amid warnings to take extra care during the dangerous weather.The Met Office with Public Health Englandhas ramped up a near-nationwide heatwave action alert – one step below national emergency.It covers southeastern and southern England until the end of the week with a less severe ‘alert and readiness’ warning across the southwest and parts of northeastern and central Britain.Elderly people and those with health conditions have been warned to stay indoors during the hottest periods this week.High humidity will make it feel close to C across parts of southern England by the end of the week, according to some forecast models.There is a  per cent chance the all-time UK record of .C will fall before the end of the week with a  per cent chance the July maximum of .C  will tumble, according to the Met Office.Meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “It is going to get very hot as we go through the week with temperatures climbing day by day.“We could see C on Wednesday and potentially C  on Thursday although it could be even hotter with a chance we could beat the all-time UK record.“This is most likely to happen somewhere across the south or the southeast.”Overnight temperatures are also likely to smash records with thermometers expected to hover around the C mark on Wednesday night.Skies across Britain could be about to turn an eerie shade of red as Saharan dust is swept in with the hot air, Mr Burkill added.He said: “We are expecting to get some Saharan dust coming up and there are also some wildfires across Portugal from which we could see some smoke also coming into the UK.“There will be a continued risk of Saharan dust through to the end of the week, so there will be some pretty sunsets.“There are signs of a cold front moving in on Friday which will bring temperatures down by around C so it will feel much fresher.”The NHS released its top heatwave tips to the public which included drinking plenty of water and using high-factor sunscreen.Hayfever and asthma sufferers have been advised to stay indoors as the temperatures soar.Climate change is widely believed to make extreme weather events signicantly more likely.The Met Office found the heatwaves last summer were  times more likely to happen now than in  because of the higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.While most will be enjoying the good weather on the first days of the school holidays, Englands most senior nurse has issued common sense advice.This includes staying out of the midday sun and drinking lots of water to help prevent children and older people falling victim to the extreme heat.Englands chief nurse Ruth May has urged people to check on their neighbours as a heatwave hits parts of the UK for the start of the school summer holidays, while Asthma UK urged sufferers to keep up their medication.She said: “Everyone can take simple steps to avoid fun in the sun turning in to a holiday in hospital.“As millions of families kick off the long summer break, it’s really important to take common sense precautions and follow our NHS top tips like drinking plenty of water, using high-factor sunscreen and taking allergy medicine where it’s needed.“The NHS will be there always for anyone who needs it, but everyone can help by checking in on vulnerable friends and neighbours, while making use of the free, convenient and helpful phone and online NHS services for minor illnesses, to help frontline staff provide care for those in emergency and serious need.”“People should talk before they walk and join the hundreds of thousands getting fast and free advice on the best course of action for them from the nhs.uk website

nukes even though the tyrant promised Donald Trump he had stopped developing them.Photographs published by the Korean Central News Agency apparently showing Kim inspecting the combat weapon systems of the new submarine.It is said to have been built under his special attention.The report could potentially signal continued development of a submarine-launched ballistic missile programme.Kim said: The operational capacity of a submarine is an important component in national defence of our country bounded on its east and west by sea.”North Korea has a large submarine fleet but only one known experimental submarine capable of carrying a ballistic missile.Analysts said the scale of the new submarine suggests it is designed to eventually carry nuclear missiles which it can launch anywhere, bringing most targets in the world within range.Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, said: We can clearly see that it is a massive submarine — much larger than the existing one thats been well known since .What I find signicant about the political messaging here is that this is the first time since a February  military parade that he has inspected a military system clearly designed to carry and deliver nuclear weapons.I take that as an ominous signal that we should be taking Kim Jong-uns end-of-year deadline for the implementation of a change in US policy with the utmost seriousness.Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam Universitys Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, said Kim Jong-un was likely also wanted to reassure North Koreans of his commitment to national defence at a time when he is focusing more on the economy.He said: Announcing his inspection of the new submarine is also to build internal solidarity, to dispel peoples concerns about national security, reassure them, and boost military morale.”Most of North Koreas fleet consists of small coastal submarines, but in recent years it has made rapid progress in the sub missile programme.In , it successfully test-fired a missile from a submarine.The location of the shipyard building the sub is unknown.But in April satellite images showed intense activity at the Sinpo South Shipyard where cylindrical components were spotted.It is speculated they are bulkheads which will be welded together to form the hull of a large submarine.Kim has declared he was stopping on testing IBMs and nuclear weapons while engaging in decentralisation talks with the United States and South Korea.The Norths submarine report comes amid another delay in dialogue between the United States and North Korea after Kim and US President Donald Trump agreed at a meeting at the Panmunjom Korean border on June  to working-level nuclear talks.Trump said such talks could come in the following two to three weeks.

I don’t agree with them being plastered in make-up, but a little bit of mascara or lip gloss isn’t hurting anyone.The school needs to move with the times. So whatthey want to make themselves look nice  It doesn’t affect their education.Mr Cafferkey said: Policies are in placeany student refuses to accept school rules, especially in relation to an issue that could be a matter of safety to themselves or to others. We work closely with parents and carers to explain the reasons why our rules are in place. We follow our policies consistently to ensure that all students are treated fairly.I can confirm that there have been no exclusions from school resulting from wearing acrylic nails.Last summer a schoolboy was excluded for refusing to wear his blazer in the heatwave."},{"url":null,"title":"remains supermarket worker 18 inch gap behind freezer undiscovered 10 years","story":"Workers discovered the body of Larry Ely Murillo-Moncada, , while removing shelves and freezers from a former No Frills Supermarket in Iowa, US.Council Bluffs Police Capt Todd Weddum said that his parents’ DNA was used to help confirm his identity after the body was recovered from the narrow gap in January.Murillo-Moncada’s parents had reported their son, a No Frills supermarket employee, missing after he disappeared on November , .He had become upset and dashed from the family home.Weddum told reporters that, at that time, Murillo-Moncada was acting irrationally, possibly due to medication he was taking.Previously, he had been deported to Honduras, but made his way back to America, reports CNN.The trail turned cold over the course of a decade when, despite checks with other law enforcement agencies, nearby detention centres and US immigration officials, there had been no sighting of him.Sgt Brandon Danielson, of Council Bluffs Police, told Des Moines Register that at the time of his disappearance there was a “snowstorm” and he had run from home “with no shoes, no socks, no keys [and] no car”.His decomposing body was found while workers were removing freezer units and shelves from the former supermarket, which closed in .Danielson said that Murillo-Moncada was working for the store at the time of his disappearance, but was not on the rota on the day he went missing.No Frills management said it wasn’t unusual for staff to visit the supermarket when not scheduled to work.Investigators believe that he entered the shop after fleeing home, climbed on top of the freezers and accidentally fell into the narrow gap, where he became trapped.Danielson explained it was about a -ft drop.And noise from the units would have covered any cries for help, he added.  A post-mortem showed Murillo-Moncada hadn’t suffered any trauma.As his death has been ruled as accidental, cops have closed the case.However, former shoppers have commented on his death on social media, saying they had noticed a horrible smell by the coolers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That kick-started the leadership race in earnest.The past few weeks have seen Boris travel theof Britain to campaign to be the next Tory leader and PM.Hes made his pitch all about delivering our EU exit by October no matter what happens.He hopes to snatch back votes from the Brexit Party and Lib Dems too.Today Boris achieves his letime ambition to become Tory leader, and tomorrow will take his place as Prime Minister of the country.He won the election with around  per cent of the vote and will become Britains th PM.Brexiteers hope he will finally deliver our EU exit,  years after Britain voted to leave.Hes vowed to get us out by October , whatever it takes."},{"url":null,"title":"hawk puppy house chihuahua garden","story":"Keith Robinson, , was out with his we Nicola walking their long-haired dachshund Bronn when it was viciously attacked by a Harris hawk being used to deter seagulls.The bird of prey was being used in Inverness, Scotland, to target gulls and Keith and Nicola, , had only been out of their house for a few minutes when the bird suddenly swooped.Mr Robinson said: “Nicola had Bronn on his lead just at the side of the house when the bird dropped on him.Basically it was trying to lt him off the ground.The bird’s handler came running over and was calling to it, but it wasn’t having any effect.After about a minute it let go, but it was terrying while it lasted.Bronn was rushed to the vet immediately after the incident on July  and escaped unscathed - though Mr Robinson says he remains timid and wary about going outdoors.It comes just days before a chihuahua was reportedly carried away by a huge gull as he played outside in the back garden in Paignton, Devon.Although uncommon, there have been a number of reports of birds of prey especially in America carrying away small dogs and other pets.Just weeks ago a wildle photographer captured the brutal moment a seagull swallowed a rabbit in just one bite on the island of Skokholm, Wales.Model Katie Hillman was walking her tiny Pomeranian dog Vinnie in fields near her home in  when a huge red kite with a ft wingspan spotted the pet.Dr. Pete Lands, the director of emergency and critical care for Saint Francis Veterinary Center in New Jersey, USA, reported an incident of a hawk picking up a client’s small dog and carrying it away.“The dog owner got into his truck to try and follow the bird, but quickly lost sight,” says Dr.Lands.Amazingly the dog was recovered two days later about a mile away with only some mild scrapes and scratches.”In May an amazing image captured by an amateur photographer sowed an eagle flying away with a tiny lamb in its talons on the Isle of Mull.Farming groups said the picture proved the giant birds were a threat to livestock, and warned they could attack household pets.Speaking to the bird’s handler afterwards Mr Robinson said she had speculated that the hawk may have mistaken Bronn on his lead for the kind of lure used in training – a piece of meat on a string.But the managing director of NBC Environment, the pest control firm engaged to work at Millburn Academy by facilities managers Mears claimed the hawk was just chasing the dog away.John Dickson said that in their native South American desert home Harris hawks often clash with coyotes over prey.“As a result they have an instinctive behaviour to chase dogs away,” he said.Mr Robinson said he and his we have asked the firm to noty them whenever they next plan to deploy the hawk, so they can keep Bronn indoors.“I think they need to just be more aware of the fact that they are operating in an area where there are lots of dog owners and they can’t be sure that nothing like this will ever happen again,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"british shipping firms switching union jacks chinese flags iran","story":"The seizure by Iran of the British-flagged Stena Impero on Friday is said to have moved major shipping firms to look for alternative flags less likely to be targeted.The claims were made by Phil Diacon, head of Dryad Global, the London-based shipping risk management firm that on Sunday released audio of communications between Iranian and British armed forces in the moments before the seizure.Speaking to the the Daily Mail, he said his clients were now considering flying the flags of other nations whose shipping Iran would not be interesting in disrupting.He added the most popular choice was China, a major player in the Gulf and an important ally to Iran.Normally its the British-flagged, US-flagged and Saudi-interest vessels that are the most likely to be targeted, Diacon said.We are starting to see talk of moving to Chinese-flagged vessels.Oil will continue to flow.The Iranians have no interests in disrupting other nations.The Stena Impero was flying a British flag because it was registered in the UK and therefore covered by UK maritime laws.Diacon added it typically takes at least a month for shippers to complete the process of registering their vessels under a dferent flag.He declined to say how his firm obtained the audio recording, though did say the exchange was conducted over an open radio channel used globally by military and commercial vessels.He added: This obviously did, to an extent, catch the UK by surprise.The shipping industry was not really prepared for this.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called the seizure illegal and said that British shipping “must and will be protected”.Iran launched a gunboat and helicopter raid on the UK-registered Stena Impero last week, claiming the vessel had turned off its tracker and ignored warnings after hitting a fishing boat.Irans Revolutionary Guard later said on the countrys state television that the ship had been boarded for violating international maritime rules.But Stena Bulk, which owns the ship, said it was in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations”.The move is widely assumed to have been a retaliation to the British seizure of an Iranian vessel off Gibraltar last week.The Iranian vessel was suspected of breaching an embargo on oil shipments to Syria, but Iran said at the time it would not leave such evil deeds unanswered.The Stena Impero was seized as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz, a channel on the Iranian coast that connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean.The Strait is just  miles wide at its narrowest point, but provides passage for a fth of the worlds oil.In a further taunt, Iran an Iranian flag was hoisted over the vessel after it was seized.In a letter to the UN Security Council, the UKs deputy permanent representative Jonathan Allen said the British vessel had been in Omani waters with its transponder switched on when it was approached.Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei insisted at a press conference in Tehran yesterday that the seizure had been a legal measure."},{"url":null,"title":"girl 2 devastated cake happy birthday loser baker misheard mum","story":"Melin

It is thought the presents cost a total of nearly £,.Sources claimed Mr Gove bought the gts with his columnist we Sarah Vine.Mrs May thanked her Cabinet for “all they had done during her premiership” – insisting it “had done much to improve people’s lives”.David Lidington, her de facto deputy, then praised the PM for her “great dedication to public service and her commitment to the union”.Theresa May’s Cabinet has been riven by a bitter civil war over Brexit and constant leaks for much of the past year as ministers jostled for position.Before the Cabinet today, the PM wrote to all Tory MPs to claim a legacy in building a better Britain. In a two-page letter she championed her proposals to cut tuition fees, put Britain on the path to net zero emissions to  and creating a new Office for Tackling Modern Injustices.She also championed the new consultation on anti-obesity measures - including a new Milkshake Tax - that was published late last night by No. despite bitter opposition from Health Secretary Matt Hancock.One senior Tory said: “If that’s all she’s achieved in three years then bring on Boris.

The proposal would give better protection to those fleeing violence by placing a new legal duty on councils to provide secure homes for them and their children. It would also introduce the first legal Government definition of domestic abuse, which would include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. A domestic abuse commissioner to champion survivors is also proposed. Sick pay  Two million of the lowest-paid workers may become eligible for sick pay under proposals launched last week. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Health Secretary Matt Hancock launched a consultation on new policies for how employers support sick and disabled staff. The proposed measures include lowering the eligibility threshold for sick pay as well as offering small businesses who help employeesto work a rebate. Under current statutory sick pay legislation, the financial support is only available to those listed as employees earning an average of £ a week, equivalent to working  hours on the adult minimum wage. The Department for Work and Pensionssaid that extending the lower limit would make two million of the lowest-paid workers eligible for sick pay.    Mental health Mrs May last month unveiled new plans to train teachers to spot early warning signs of mental illness. The PM wants training to include lessons to address issues such as self-harm. Under the plans there would be £m made available for a competition to come up with innovative ideas to tackle mental health problems among students. And NHS staff will be encouraged to take suicide prevention training. The environment  Britain will have a legally-binding target to end its contribution to climate change by , under another last-minute announcement by the PM The Government laid out a new law to set a new target to cut emissions to net zero by the middle of the century. Hitting net zero - a % cut in emissions - will mean an end to heating of homes with traditional gas boilers, more green electricity, and a switch from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles, walking and cycling. The plan will amend the existing goal to cut climate pollution by % by , which was agreed by MPs under the Climate Change Act in .    Children’s funeral fund Mrs May finally delivered on her pledge to abolish child burial fees last week,In a sensational win for campaigning Labour MP Carolyn Harris and the Sunday Mirror, the Government will pay local authority fees, funeral expenses and contribute £ toward a coffin.The Prime Minister’s move came  months after her vow – meaning the parents of , deceased children and stillborn babies missed out in that time. They found themselves facing bills of thousands of pounds for burial or cremation fees, which can y widely across the country. Modern slavery  The PM announced the establishment of the Modern Slavery Research Centre earlier this month. According to Number , the centre will “uncover the true scale of modern slavery, expose more trafficking networks and better inform our action to stamp out these crimes.” The passing of the Modern Slavery Act , while Mrs May was Home Secretary, has been repeatedly cited by the PM as one of her proudest achievements in office. Parental leave shake-up Mrs May launched a shake-up of parental leave entitlements, which could see fathers spend more time with their babies. She also set out plans to support parents whose baby is born prematurely or needs an extended hospital stay. A consultation into the proposals asks questions about whether statutory paternity leave for fathers and same-sex partners should be changed. It also calls for suggestions on ways in which the shared parental leave policy introduced in  could be improved.

But the whole time No Deal has been the backup plan - with Theresa May committing £billion or so, and Boris Johnson vowing to ramp up preparations further. So what does it actually mean in practical terms  If thereaposs no arrangement in time, weaposll lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and face the prospect of goods checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. So the government published  technical notices over  and  outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats.    UK officials also unveiled aposday oneapos tarfs that would slap £, on the cost of a family car from the EU - but leave % of goods imports, including steel, tarf free. This could threaten struggling UK industries with a flood of cheap imports, but would also prevent searing price hikes that hit your wallet in the short term. Meanwhile ministers had , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Supermarkets and pharma giants were told to stockpile food and medicine. A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whoaposve written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le.  What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government canapost agree a Brexit aposWithdrawal Agreementapos by the Brexit deadline . The current -page deal, on the table since November , would have ensured businesses arenapost cut off by continuing rules in a apostransition periodapos until December . However, it came at a cost - a aposbackstopapos that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs and Boris Johnson opposed it. Mr Johnson has vowed to re-open talks on the deal, including dumping the backstop, despite the EU refusing to do so. If that fails, it leads us to a No Deal Brexit. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal aposblack holesapos where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . What is Boris Johnsonaposs plan for No Deal Brexit   Plan A is to renegotiate Theresa Mayaposs original, -page Brexit deal and come out with a deal on October . Plan B is to leave with no deal, but get a standstill arrangement from November  onwards to prevent crippling new tarfs. Plan C is to leave with no deal and no standstill arrangement. Experts say Plan B in particular is complete fantasy land. Boris Johnson claims he can use Article  of the General Agreement on Tarfs and Tradeto stop new tarfs springing up. This is called a managed no-deal - arranging lots of mini-deals to help smooth the path of leaving the EU. But GATT  says a plan and schedule must already be in place to form a customs union or free trade area, within a reasonableof time. That doesnapost include a No Deal Brexit . What does the governmentaposs financial watchdog say about No Deal Brexit  No Deal Brexit would trigger a year-long UK recession in just a few monthsapos time, the governmentaposs official spending watchdog predicted in July . The Office for Budget Responsibility said a recession would begin in the final three months of the UK leaves without agreement on October . The pound would drop in value instantly by % - while unemployment would rise by more than a quarter. GDP would fall % by the end of , around the same as the early s recession and a third of what was seen in the  financial crisis. In all No Deal would add about £billion a year to government borrowing from , the OBR said - or, put another way, £million a week. That in turn would hike the UKaposs net debt by % of GDP by March . Despite the drastic findings, OBR forecasters said their stress test was by no means a worst-case scenario.     ways No Deal Brexit could hit you DISCLAIMER: This information was gleaned mainly from government No Deal preparedness documents and advice over the last year. Some of these situations may be avoidedthere is a managed No Deal. . Martial law could be imposed with thousands of troops on standby  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention. . You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter aposSchengen areaapos countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  October  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  yearsapos validity, youaposll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years donapost count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. . Pet owners must visit the vet FOUR MONTHS before a holiday  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youaposd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  . KFC and other big names could run out of food   Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply.  But thataposs not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet.  And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs, Asda and McDonaldaposs signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited.   As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK.  They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeksapos inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted.  . You could lose your job  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKaposs way, hitting jobs in generations . Your motorway commute faces becoming a lorry park  UPDATE: After the October extension was agreed, Highways England deactivated Operation Brock until further notice. You can find the latest updates here. Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From aposearly apos the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton. . Millions of plane tickets could be cancelled  UPDATE: In March  the EU and UK agreed in principle to an reciprocal arrangement which would keep planes in the air for a year after the original exit date of  March  even in a no deal scenario. Itaposs unclear whether this will now apply for a year after  October. The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a aposno dealapos, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodthereaposs No Deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails. . Youaposll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The £. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testthereaposs a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are a UK licence holder living in the EU or EEA you should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is no EU Exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there. . If youaposre an EU citizen, youaposll have fewer rights to stay in the UK  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether thereaposs a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyaposll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country. . Pharmacies and hospitals could start rationing medicine  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctorsapos prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the aposOperational Response Centreapos and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed heaposs become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a No Deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament. . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar aposdisruptionapos  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnapost guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. The EU has agreed to keep permissions for services like the Channel Tunnel open for three monthsthere is No Deal, while a new agreement is negotiated. But there arenapost guarantees. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit.  Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now.  But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight.  “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note.  “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.”  . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statesthereaposs a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelandaposs Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventhereaposs a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thataposs based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youaposll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peopleaposs rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governmentaposs advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnapost result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  October . . If youaposre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  October . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between £ and £,. They will also need an import export license, which costs £. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wonapost be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in aposendangered speciesapos that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youaposd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use.

Peterborough in Cambridgeshire came bottom of the aposCrap Townapos list with residents condemning it as backwards and miserable. The city boasts a th century cathedral, a Bronze Age village, a fossil display and a sizeable population of almost , inhabitants. Despite its impressive cultural and historical signicance, one person described it as the biggest dump in England with aggressive and inbred residents. Almost , people cast their vote for ilivehereaposs ranking Britainaposs least inspiring places to live. These are the places that make up the list...  Peterborough  The city has its fair share of detractors who say it is less than welcoming to visitors. The guide says: If booking a weekend get-away in Peterborough, it is customarya stranger holds eye contact with you for more than three seconds, to shout aposWhat apos and become extremely aggressive. Another described the people as without doubt some of the most aggressive, miserable, backwards, negative people I have ever come across. Thereaposs not a lot to love about this West Yorkshire market town, according to repsondents. One person said: Thereaposs nothing but pound shops and a few coffee shops. Itaposs polluted, unclean, full of idiots and a horrible place to live. Another local said: Itaposs a rough, boring, chavvy, c**p hole. For a demonstration of the chav scooterists trying to impress the scummy lady chavs, simply go and look in Morrisons car park from pm onwards - thousands of the cretins, unfortunately they never seem to fall off. In shortyou like your car windows, teeth, kneecaps etc. then avoid this s***e like you would a man with leprosy! You have been warned.    Rochdale  The Greater Manchester town was described in unflattering terms by those who got in touch. One person said: Take in the smells - the strong whf of tobacco and fatty foods with subtle hints of exhaust fumes, sweat and damp vegetables from the market area - and seeyou can detect a undertone of vomit, Karate aftershave and old cheese. And another said: Welcome to the cesspit of the universe, where evolution took a break and spat out this breed of useless slack-jawed yokels with less IQ than a glass of water.  Doncaster  A respondent wrote: Youaposve probably been forced to pass here on the train at some time in your le and seen all the attractions such as smack and rat-infested flats. Ah Doncaster, that s**t-hole surrounded by other s**t-holes like Hull, Barnsley, Pontefract, Scunthorpe and Rotherham. A night out in Donny is magical, with bums sitting on steps drinking White Lightning near the old strip club or the Jobcentre, and chavvettes with near nothing on, looking to volunteer to contribute to Doncasteraposs rising pregnancy rate.  Hull  Hull has made the top  every year since  and is three-times overall winner - so this is possibly an improvement. One critic said: I was born and bred in Hull and can honestly say itaposs a dump. Just spend ten minutes outside the Maternity Unit at Hull Royal Infirmary.  Rotherham  Rotherham is described as a worthy nomination by one disappointed critic: I think Iaposll head off somewhere  and get away from it all. I put as much distance between me and the population as possible after that first visit. I stopped going into the town centre - there was just no point because I like a pint without violence. After a year of reading headlines in the Rotherham Advertiser like aposChip Pan Fire Guts Houseapos, aposBody found outside Takeawayapos and aposAsbo Grandad at it againapos I decided I didnapost fit in and moved away.  Blackpool  Describing itself as the entertainment capital of the North, it was once famed for its golden mile but now according to locals, conjures up images of drunken stags and hens, falling over in the street and spewing on themselves, before retiring to a grotty seaside. One respondent said: Just walking around the town centre and seeing the result of years of inbreeding is an ordeal - we try to avoid the place unless absolutely necessary. The best thing about Blackpool is the M out. While in Blackpool all you smell is weed, McDonaldaposs, KFC - you may think itaposs a jolly seaside resort with candy floss and donkeys but itaposs a scum-bucket for the transients who come here to draw benefits in a holiday resort instead of in an inner city.  Castleford  One local reported: Highly scientic research - walking down the high street - revealed that one in three inhabitants under the age of  fits neatly into the chav box. In a town where everybody is a blood relative of the person next to them, you have to wonder whether the chavdom stems from bad breeding, or in the case of Castleford, possible interbreeding. A trip to Castleford is a real eye opener- and you need to keep your eyes open becauseyou dare to close them, theyaposd have your wallet faster than you could say aposXRi.apos If someone wanted to give Yorkshire an enema, this is where theyaposd stick the tube.  Oldham  The guide claims: This Greater Manchester town conjures up images of shaven-headed gentlemen discussing the political issues of the day in a flat roof pub like the one in the TV show aposShamelessapos and the reality is only slightly dferent. The people of Oldham look as though the government has been performing nuclear testing in the area. If you want culture and sophistication, then look no further than Yorkshire Street and the local shopping centres, where Sports Direct is the new Hugo Boss and TJ Hughes is the new Harrods.  Blackburn  The Lancashire town hold the dubious honour of being crown the least offensive borough on list. One said: The estates make Syria look calm. You can guarantee thatyou dare to walk down these down-trodden dogs**t ridden estates - and mind the needles- you will spot the inhabitants walking freely in dressing gowns, fluffy slippers and in the case of women, undoubtedly pregnant, with a fag in their gob going to pick up another free prescription from the clap clinic. And: Drug dealers, dole wasters, bums, guttersnipes, fallen women, young slappers and their steroid-pumped teenage boyfriends. Itaposs a nightmare - a cross between aposShamelessapos and the aposStar Warsapos canteen.

The victim was out looking for a missing dog when he came across Tammy Goodfellow and her family members on a Hull road in the early hours of June  last year. The -year-old matriarch mistook the man for someone who had been in an altercation with her -year-old son Joe George, Hull Daily Mail reported.The victim was attacked by barefooted Tammy Goodfellow, who was dragged away from the scene. She broke free while the man was being helped by his pregnant partner, hitting him again with a flurry of kicks.    George, who was awaiting sentence for having an offensive weapon and assault, joined the attack until he fell over and was knocked out by banging his head on a bollard. CCTV played to the court by prosecutor Martin Robertshaw showed the victim in a struggle with Tammy Goodfellow, her husband Michael, , and George, before she turned and began punching the man in the face.George also tried to hit him. After seeming to try to break the fight up, Michael Goodfellow began strangling the victim from behind until he passes out.He continued to hold the choke hold while he lay on the floor.Mr Robertshaw said: By that grip heaposs effectively choking the complainant, who was finding it dficult to breathe, and he fell to the ground.When he fell to the ground he was clearly unconscious. Such was his condition he lost control of his bladder and wet himself.

Bonnie Beck made the simple swap of carrying her shopping in multi-use plastic containers after she had been mortied by the aposhundreds of pounds worthapos of carrier bags accrued under her kitchen sink. The mum-of-one had used the two boxes for months when she was stopped by a curious shopper on Tuesday who told her it was a aposfantastic ideaapos and would now start doing it herself. The praise prompted the -year-old beautician to share a photo of two grey plastic boxes neatly packed with her weekly foodshop in the boot of her car on Facebook to encourage people to apossave the planetapos. The post has been shared, liked and commented more than , times and one woman even claimed she would swap her mini so she could fit containers in her car boot.  But while many praised the aposgenius hackapos, some environmentally-conscious commenters slammed the idea as aposabsolute nonsenseapos and blasted Bonnie for not swapping to organic cotton or paper bags instead. Bonnie, from Nottingham, said: I am not trying to be an eco warrior. I am just a normal person who had a little bit of an idea. The ecological side of it aside, itaposs just a nty little shopping hack. Itaposs not about not buying carrier bags anymore. Itaposs useful and to find it more convenient. It literally started at my car putting my shopping from my trolley into the boxes in the boot of my car.  A woman walked past, stopped and said aposwhat a fantastic idea that isapos and she was going to start doing it too. I thought nothing of it - I just thought it was a normal thing but her saying that made me think maybe other people would like to know about it too. Itaposs a very small minority of people being negative about it. Someone said I should be made a dame - I will take that. If it helps to make shopping easier Iaposm glad to have been of assistance where that is concerned. It has made a massive dference to me. It might not work for everyone because I do have a large boot and I am physically able to carry the boxes eventhey are quite heavy, but I find it much easier doing that than going in and out carrying  carrier bags.  Not using carrier bags was my motivation, but for other people it might just be a nice little le hack. Bonnie posted her picture of two grey plastic boxes neatly packed with her weekly foodshop, claiming it helped her to cut back on plastic and made her shopping easier to carry. Bonnie original post reads: A random woman in ASDA car park was so impressed with how I take my shopping home I thought Iaposd share my idea with you all. I stopped buying bags a long time ago . I keep these containers in my boot and load them up at the car. SO SO easy to carry my shopping in [at] home too. Then when Iaposm done they slot back inside each other to save space and stay in my boot. £lehack £savetheplanet.  Bonnie, who is a beautician and owner of Bonnieaposs Beauty Temple, said: It was prompted by I couldnapost find something, so I went to have a look in the cupboard under the sink and couldnapost see anything in there for carrier bags. I literally pulled out all of the carrier bags in the cupboard under the sink and was disgusted at how many I had under there. I genuinely felt ashamed of myself. It must have been hundreds of pounds worth of carrier bags. I wanted to use an alternative. I drove to IKEA and got some tubs. It was a sequence of events that lead to it really. However not everyone reacted to Bonnieaposs post in a positive way. Many environmentally-conscious social media users picked holes in Bonnieaposs idea such as pointing out that the plastic boxes she was using were not good for the environment either.

The rare condition, Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder , apparently occurred after a routine smear test was botched in . The woman, named only as Maria, , said even going to a Shania Twain concert made her orgasm. And she said the aposgreat arousalapos - that she experiences without any sexual desire - has turned her into a recluse. The mum-of-three, who was formerly the chair of a reproductive charity, said women who suffer from the condition aposshould know they are not freaksapos.  She added: People shouldnapost have to go through this and be ridiculed. Itaposs far from funny. This has broken up marriages. Some women have taken their own lives. It saps your confidence because, to be honest, there are days I wish I wasnapost here. The health board have disputed that the damage to her pudendal nerve was definitely caused by the smear test. She believes it was triggered after a routine gynaecological examination at Glasgowaposs Stobhill Hospital in September , where a consultant aposrammedapos a speculum into her.    The following month she began experiencing distressing symptoms for the first time which would eventually be diagnosed as PGAD, caused by damage to her pudendal nerve. Maria said: I just didnapost know what was happening. Youaposve got this great arousal but itaposs not going anywhere or triggered by anything. Most of the time I feel like I am sitting on an antaposs nest. Thereaposs times where itaposs a tickle all day, but then something sets it off and itaposs a full-blown orgasm. Driving over potholes, aircraft turbulence, escalators, the vibration from violins - I donapost know how many women could say they went to a Shania Twain concert and she made them orgasm. Ninety per cent of my le has been wrecked and the other ten per cent is not so great either. I had to give up volunteering because just moving can set it off.  One of my friends said to me Iaposd become a recluse. The widow, from East Dunbartonshire, fears using Botox as a form of treatment could leave her incontinent. But other treatments, including numbing gels, pelvic floor physiotherapy and steroid injections directly into her clitoris, have proved ineffective. Maria, who has adult children, said: To think that this damage was caused by a consultantaposs incompetence and then you have incontinence as a result of things you do to try to cure the damage is just ludicrous. Itaposs shocking. She has been lobbying to be referred abroad for treatment, but despite the efforts of her MP Jo Swinson, the request has been declined by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board. Instead, the trust has referred her to London for treatment, as Scotland has no specialist in PGAD - which was formally recognised as a disorder in  and affects one per cent of women. A spokesman for NHS GGC said: We have explored and exhausted all treatments available locally for this patient and have been unable to relieve their symptoms.

Other striking shots show forgotten amusements including Ski Ball, merry-go-rounds and creepy statues perched on rotting porches. The spooky snaps were taken at the Ghost Town in the Sky theme park in Maggie Valley, North Carolina, USA by a photographer known as Abandoned Southeast. Ghost Town in the Sky was the vision of businessman R.B. Coburn, a Covington, Virginia native who moved to Maggie Valley, North Carolina, he said. Coburn was inspired to create a Western-themed amusement park after visiting several ghost towns in the American West.    In , Coburn purchased Buck Mountain at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains for the location of his theme park. Ghost Town was designed by Russell Pearson and constructed at a cost of  million. The park opened on May , , and quickly became one of the stateaposs most popular tourist attractions. It was promoted as aposNorth Carolinaaposs mile-high theme park.apos    New rides and attractions were added to the theme park throughout the years and Ghost Town is thought to have attracted millions of guests. At its peak in the s, Ghost Town had more than , visitors each season. The photographer continued: Ghost Town was sold in  to National Services in a stock swap, but Coburn bought it back in  and constructed the parkaposs famous roller coaster. Under Coburnaposs ownership, the park suffered from a lack of maintenance and mismanagement. Ghost Town garnered a reputation for the rides constantly breaking down.  The chairlt and incline railway also required constant maintenance and repair. Coburn spent thousands of dollars maintaining both. A double incline railway was constructed to bring visitors to the top of Buck Mountain. On July , , the chairlt maled, leaving passengers stranded for over two hours in the rain. Coburn decided to close Ghost Town a few days after the chairlt failure and put the property up for sale. The park remained closed and unmaintained for the next four years, giving many the impression that nobody would buy the park due to the condition of the rides. Without proper security, the park was subject to vandalism.  In , after  million had been spent,  million of that on the Clfhanger roller coaster, Ghost Town filed for bankruptcy. The Great Recession of  was blamed for the parkaposs problems, but owners insisted the park would reopen and would continue to operate. By May , the rides had not been inspected and the owners claimed to need a loan for , in order to reopen, the photographer told.  The park asked the local town for the money. Failure to secure the loan was expected to mean the loss of  jobs and a loss of revenue for local businesses from park visitors. Ghost Town reopened for the  season after an anonymous donor provided the money. The park struggled to make payroll and soon complaints began that employees were not being paid. In February , a massive mudslide occurred when retaining walls on Ghost Town property gave way, added Abandoned Southeast. Although there were no injuries,  homes had to be evacuated and three were damaged. The park itself sustained damage, but to what extent is publicly unknown.  A month later, a judge ruled to proceed with foreclosure on Ghost Town and sell the property at auction. Ghost Town remained closed for the  season. Ghost Town was purchased in February  at public auction by Alaska Presley, a local businesswoman and long-time supporter, for . million. The previous owners did not shut off the water after the park closed, so the old pipes were subject to the mountain freeze-and-thaw cycle. Wells for private water were condemned because they were too close to potentially unacceptable objects. Four new wells were drilled and all were failures except one of limited output. The option of city water was decided which meant virtually every part of the old system had to be replaced.

Jessica Landonaposs organs started to fail after lying in the same spot downing the spirit for more than one month. The model became addicted to alcohol in her early s and admitted she was a twenty-four hour a day vodka drinker by . She had to live in a friendaposs attic but one day, she tripped over the stair rail, landed on her head and suffered a baseball-sized brain haemorrhage. And months later after another relapse, Jessicaaposs organs failed, she spent a month lying in her own filth and the acid in her urine ate away at her skin.    The addiction stemmed from being molested by a babysitter when she was five years old, Jessica said. But now , Jessica has been sober since January , , and sheaposs using her remarkable story to inspire others. I was an aposin the closetapos drinkerfrom the very start, rarely drinking in public or at parties but rather surreptitiously. Liquor was the magic medication I had been searching for, the only thing that could relieve me from my anxiety panic and shame I felt on the inside, she said.    Jessica moved from Rancho Cucamonga, Calornia, USA to LA when she was  to pursue her dream. Since then, she has modelled for Playboy and Perfect , and acted on Nickelodeon, NBC and Comedy Central shows. But the recovery coach says there was always an emptiness. Now looking back, I see that I was perpetually trying to fill that void with things like alcohol, love, food. aposYou only live onceapos was my motto. Which was more of a justication for not taking care of myself or my health. When I was really young I was molested by a babysitter which led to a lot of guilt and shame.!I,felt that I did something to cause it and that it was somehow my fault which I think contributed to my addiction punitive self-destruction.  By the time I was  years old I was a -hour-a-day vodka drinker. Iaposd pass out at night and wake up in a panic, shaking violently, so I kept vodka in a water bottle next to my bed to chugI accidentally slept too long and hit withdrawals. I was vomiting blood on a regular basis. It became a living hell. I lay on his floor and nearly drank myself to death. I was incapable of getting up to use the restroom because I was too weak and atrophied, so I laid there urinating and defecating on myself for over a month in one spot. The acid from my urine was eating away my skin on my hips and tailbone which ultimately caused a blood staph infection. I knew I was dying rapidly and became desperate. I called an ex and begged for help. By the grace of God, he showed up the next morning with an ambulance.

Mike, from nearby Drumnadrochit, had just finished explaining the story of the mythical creature and the castle on the water when a tourist spotted the anomaly on his sonar.    The image shows the sonar device with  metres at the top left hand corner indicating the total distance to the bottom at that point. On the right hand side the device goes down in increments of  metres and on it about  metres there is a big blip which suggest a big fish. However, at  metres there is a long zig-zag line suggesting a very large object, which Mike believes could be the Loch Ness Monster.

Itaposs my first year being the skipper in the boat in five months and Iaposve never seen it or had something that big on the sonar My dad is the more experienced skipper who has been doing this for a few years and has said heaposs never seen it that big before on the sonar. Itaposs my first sighting of Nessie and I think my dad is a wee bit jealous as he has never seen it. The standard size on the sonar is usually a sharp prick suggesting a small fish. The large line about  metres in the water was about - feet. An object of that size I would think is way too big for the normal species in the loch. It must have been about five or six minutes we spent trying to pick up this creature again.

Iiris Heikkinen, , used to wash her hair every day but said it was too clean, leaving her with a dry and itchy scalp.She decided to swap her organic products for apple vinegar and baking soda, which are supposed to absorb the dirt and grease, but after doing some research decided to take things a step further after discovering some aposno poo methodapos groups on Facebook .The growing movement, which is popular among wellness bloggers, sees followers ditch shampoo and conditioner, believing that the hair can cleanse itself using natural oils. Now, Iiris, of Inari, Finland, uses nothing except water – and a dab of coconut oil once every couple of months – and says she has never looked back.    She explained: “After just a couple of weeks of the no poo method, the itching stopped. There was a point at first where my hair looked greasy, but I pushed through it and it soon went back to normal. “Now, when people meet me, they have no idea I don’t use shampoo. When I tell them, they are always surprised and say how healthy and clean my hair looks.” Eco-aware Iiris, who is studying for a masters degree in primary education, explained that, previously, she would wash her hair every few days using organic shampoo and conditioner. She added: “I have always been mindful of the environment, and so started using organic cosmetics when I got to university as, living in a big city then, there was more choice. “I believe it’s far better to use organic products. It’s better for the environment, it’s kinder as there is no animal testing and it also feels healthier to know you are only using natural ingredients and not putting any harsh chemicals on your skin or hair.”    But Iiris still found that her scalp would itch terribly and she believed this was caused by shampoo stripping it of its natural oils. So, in the autumn of , she began looking for alternatives. She continued: “I Googled things like, ‘How to wash your hair without shampoo’ and eventually came across some no poo method Facebook groups. “Everyone was swapping tips and advice, so I read up about all their experiences. Lots of people recommended trying apple cider vinegar or baking soda instead.” In September , Iiris threw away the shampoo and conditioner for good, becoming a fully-fledged follower of the no poo method. The thinking behind the movement is that the over-use of chemicals – some of which may be harmful, according to the non-profit Environmental Working Group, who have put together a database where users can check the ingredients of their cosmetics – renders the hair unable to naturally clean itself. “There were a few weeks of it looking greasy,” she admitted. “But around the same time, I was in hospital having surgery for some ongoing health problems, so I really wasn’t thinking about my hair anyway.    “I was never temped to wash it. I don’t know exactly how long it took for the greasy phase to pass, but by the time I’d recovered from surgery and was going back out and about again in January, my hair looked normal.”Now, Iiris simply washes her hair with water whenever she has a shower, and only very occasionally uses a dab of coconut oil or neem leaf powder – a type of herb used in ancient Indian medicine - to give extra conditioningshe is has a dandruff flare up, or talcum powder to help style her locks by adding extra texture.Though her tresses were in fairly good condition anyway as she rarely used hairdryers or straighteners, she has noted that they appear thicker and wavier since she ditched shampoo. Interestingly, the colour of her hair has also slightly changed and looks more of a natural blonde. As many of her friends are equally eco-minded, she does not face much criticism for her decision to shun hair products – but does recall one occasion where she was asked by a friendher hair smelled. “That seems to be a big misconception,” she said. “Of course, it’s pretty hard to smell my own scalp, but to me, it smells completely neutral and I’ve certainly never had any comments on it. “If you met me, you’d have no idea I don’t use shampoo.    “When people find out, they are really surprised, so that should show that it’s easy to still be hygienic. They often say my hair looks better thanI had used shampoo.” The only time Iiris’ hair needs slightly more rigorous washing than usual is after she has used a sauna – a major part of Finnish culture. She continued: “Living in Finland, we have a lot of saunas, so obviously you sweat. When I’ve been in one, I’ll still use just water but find it sometimes takes a couple of washes for my hair to look normal. “I love the no poo method, but I understand everyone’s hair, and lestyles are dferent, so I can’t sayit’s right for everyone. “For example,you are somebody that exercises loads and sweats a lot, maybe using just water won’t be right for you. That isn’t me though, I’m not someone who trains in the gym every single day.” Extolling the virtues of her product-free hair regime, Iiris says she is unlikely to ever pick the shampoo bottle up again. She concluded: “It has made le so much easier – even things you wouldn’t think about, like travelling. Now, I don’t have to worry about carrying round all these dferent bottles of product with me. “I love the environmental benefits too. I’m not using any plastic, that will get thrown away and wind up in the ocean.

The Awa are believed to be the worldaposs most threatened tribe, according to the NGO Survival International.    Environmental campaigners say they are constantly threatened by illegal loggers, miners and drug traffickers who want to move into the land. The footage was recorded by a member of a neighbouring tribe, the Guajajara, who are aiming to protect the isolated indigenous people of the region. It was released yesterday as they warned of the growing threats to the tribe from loggers who are nearing their traditional hunting ground.   Flay Guajajara, who shot the image while out hunting and released it through the  Mídia Índia , said: We hope this film produces something positive.We hope it makes an impact around the world to help protect our people and our forest. Whilst some members of the Awa have made contact with the outside world, it is believed there are many living in isolated areas of the rainforest that are under threat from logging. Survival International say illegal loggers and farmers in the region have been emboldened by the pro-business message of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.

Considine netted the opener in a memorable - win to inflict the first home defeat on the Croatians for  months.In a strange quirk of fate the Dons will book ato Rijeka should they despatch the Georgians in the second qualying round. Bizarrely, UEFA opted to make the draw for the next round in Lyon yesterday, before a ball had been kicked in the second qualying phase.Considine, , insists all the focus remains on facing the Georgians at the ,-capacity Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, home of Dinamo Tbilisi.He said: “We are due to go back to Rijeka all being wellwe get through this tie.“However, all the focus is on Georgia, which will be a tough test. They had a couple of good results in the last round against Fola Esch, who we played a few years ago.“The Georgians have had a lot of games in their own league, so they will be fit and ready to go.“However, the two games against Rovaniemi will stand us in good stead.“It is another great test against a team we have never come across before. That is why you play in Europe, to test yourself against these teams.”Aberdeen have a short turn around for the ,-mile round trip to Georgia. They will jet out early tomorrow and will train at the stadium late in the evening.From the Arctic Circle to the crossroads of Asia and Europe within a week, such are the logistics of European football.Aberdeen expect around  supporters to make the journey out to the Georgian capital.Considine said: “This is going to be a dferent test from the ties against Rovaniemi.“A lot of people looked at the Rovaniemi games aswe would walk over them.“However, I felt in both ties they held their own to a certain extent.“Rovaniemi played on astro turf, but we knew what it was like to play on that as there are a few teams in Scotland that use it.“At times they played some good football on it, so it was a tough evening in Finland.“Hopefully we will have some players back from injury for the game in Georgia.”The Europa League group stages are the target for Aberdeen this season. This is the sixth successive season in Europe under manager Derek McInnes and the Dons have yet to progress beyond the third qualying round.Considine is the only remaining Don from the - campaign when the Reds not only reached the UEFA Cup groups, but qualied for the last  knock-out phase to set up a glamour clash with Bayern Munich.Considine said: “It is a dferent ball game trying to reach the group stages nowadays as it was just the two games against Dnipro to get to the groups.“Now it is eight games to get to the group stages – but regardless it is going to be tough and you need to take it game by game.”Andy Considine talked to the Evening Express at the launch of the Dons’ partnership with First Aberdeen."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10172415.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

But populism has nothing to do with the social origins of its leaders. Nigel Farage used to be an investment banker. Donald Trump is a billionaire. It is about the people they seek to represent ndash often dismissively labelled the ldquoleft behinds, often non-graduates in low-paying jobs in non-metropolitan areas. The force that gave us Brexit.By its very nature, populism is not a coherent political philosophy. It is more visceral ndash the inarticulate fury of people who feel they the plaything of remote forces beyond their control. Its origins lay in the disruption that followed the  financial crisis, in which bankers were bailed out but not the people. They suffered insecurity, economic uncertainty and the longest pay freeze since the Napoleonic Wars.Populists linked arms with the more traditional, reactionary nationalist politicians against the globalist, liberal-democratic ldquoestablishment, that has dominated the media and politics for the last three decades. Think of Brown, Clegg and Cameron standing in line in the  election: three identikit, pro-European, neoliberal suits. Think of the leaders of the European Union. That is the establishment against which populists believe they are revolting.:Boris Johnson is asked what furniture he would need inside Number In France, the Gilet Jaunes protest continues, after nine months of street demonstrations, violent confrontations and petition-signing. It is inchoate, unpredictable and largely leaderless. But as anyone visiting France this summer will testy ndash it is everywhere. And it is overwhelmingly white. The repressive measures used against them by President Macron would be a national scandal were they used here.As Donald Trump demonstrated last week, populism has a strong racialist strand, though it is not simply a fascist movement as many on the left claim. Donald Trump is not an ideological white supremacist . He is above all an opportunist, ready to use whatever comes to hand to promote his personal popularity. With him, ratings mean more than political conviction.But that doesnt mean he can plead innocence after his genuinely shocking attacks on the democratic ldquowomen of colour last week . This began as crude electoral politics. He was trolling the Democrat Party, and the media, by singling out the radical ldquosquad of Democrat congresswomen, as theyre known. He wants the Democrats to be indelibly associated in the public mind with its multicultural Left, the better to win over white middle Americans and moderate Latinos. But he unleashed something deeply worrying.As the chants of ldquosend them home erupted at his rally Trumps trademark smirk seemed at first to nodding along. But even he now seems uneasy about the genie he has uncorked. Not since the s has racism been a factor in US presidential politics ndash at least not overtly. Barak Obama avoided playing the race card. Trump has now placed it firmly on the table, and it isnt going to go away.Donald Trumps flirtation with racism could actually lose him the next election, because many middle Americans are appalled at his behaviour. The United States prides itself, after all, on being the most multi-cultural, multi-racial society in the world ndash one which used to welcome ldquothe huddled masses of immigrants with open arms.Iain Macwhirter: Why Irsquom secretly looking forward to seeing Boris Johnson in Number TenBut liberals shouldnt get their hopes up. There is no rule that says racism cant help win elections. These are troubled times, and politicians need to exercise responsibility so as not to conjure forces they cannot control.Boris Johnson is also often called a racist, and a homophobe. This is largely because of his describing burqa-wearing Muslims as ldquobank-robbers and ldquoletter boxes. The future PM is not himself racist, as anyone who knows him can testy, but that doesnt mean he is immune to its compelling force.As London Mayor, Boris Johnson made great efforts to win the support of Muslims in that multi-racial city. He included many non-whites in his cabinet. When he takes over this week we can expect him to make great play of his progressive liberal credentials. He will remind voters that the infamousarticle argued against banning the burqa.However, there is no doubt that his signature politics of Brexit, while not racist in itself, arises at least in part from resentment at immigration. Many of Johnsons supporters are the kind of people you might find at Donald Trump rallies. His first test as Prime Minister should be to create clear multicultural water between himself and the American President ndash his equivocation last week about labelling Trumps remarks ldquoracist does not augur well.Johnson desperately needs the White House to deliver some kind of free trade deal that will show Europe that Brexit Britain means business. His first foreign visit as Prime Minister will be to the Trump Residence to plead his case for special treatment on trade. If Mr Johnson has any integrity, he will also make clear his concern at Trumps racist rhetoric ndash but I wouldnt hold my breath.Its an open secret that Johnson is looking to an early election to capitalise on Labours internal problems, which are to do with allegations of another kind of racialism: anti-Semitism. However, Westminster is now a four party political system with Nigel Farages Brexit Party and the revived Liberal Democrats challenging hard. Boris Johnson may have to seek the support of the Faragiste MPs to form a government. That could sht British politics further to the populist right.Nigel Farages party is not an overtly racist party either, though his former vehicle, Ukip, has recently been showing clear signs of becoming one. But there is no doubt that Brexit Party supporters are hostile to immigration. Racism exists as a latent force in all parties, but in nationalist ones in particular. Our own Scottish National Party used to have in its ranks ldquoanglophobes like the poet Hugh MacDiarmid, and ldquoblood and soil factions like ldquoSeed of the Gael.David Pratt: Tracing Trumps bigotryHowever, the SNP also stands as a beacon of hope in this darkening night of populism. For the party expunged all trace of anti-English racism from its ranks in the s and s. It is now arguably the most progressive, anti-racialist political party in the UK. Of course, there are still some SNP supporters around who hate English people, but they are not tolerated.There is a huge temptation for SNP politicians to subtly exploit latent anglophobia when arguing against ldquoWestminster rule. But the SNP has shown that it is possible to conduct nationalist politics with great success by avoiding these ldquotropes as theyre called. Indeed, the SNPs electoral success has largely been built on the claim that Scotland could be more progressive and more multicultural than the UK. It has raised ersity and antiracism to the level of a national political programme. In these dficult times, we should be thankful for that at least."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-give-mps-free-vote-solve-brexit-mess","story":"It seems abundantly clear that the view of Brexit placed before the electorate at the time of the referendum could be said to have been seriously unrealistic. The House of Commons is now very well placed to say whether or not the concept of Brexit placed before the voters at the time of the referendum is still defensible, and henceone can reasonably refer to the will of the people as expressed at that time as still being relevant. Accordingly I believe that a free vote ndash a vote of conscience ndash by the House of Commons, should be held, with two clear options: either to abandon the process of leaving the European Union, or to continue on a path to departure. This move would place Members of Parliament in their proper position as inidual elected representatives in a representative democracy of deciding on behalf of all their constituents which path to follow. Before the vote MPs should, I consider, be reminded that as they represent all their constituents , they must put aside party and personal predilections, and vote on what they believe, in conscience, is in the best interests of all of their constituents, of all of the people of the United Kingdom and of the concept of a peaceful Europe.

As one banker put it some years ago: ldquoScotland was in recession for  years.GR Weir, Ochiltree.MANY people are critical of our politicians, with good reason, but the underlying causes of their poor performance are not clear.One possibility is that the political approach to decision-making is derived from the legal system. Unfortunately, the practice of deciding outcomes by persuasive argument is not always fit for purpose outside the courtroom. Global warming will dominate le on earth for the foreseeable future and no amount of discussion or debate will change this, yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer insists on pointing out that the costs are very high, with the implication that we should continue burning coal, oil and gas. Of course the costs are high, but the alternatives even in the medium term are much worse.Brexit is a classic example of a decision that should be made following a determined and honest attempt to establish the facts and to make those facts public. Instead we have groups of people who think that they can win an argument, based purely on rhetoric. Evenmany of the outcomes are uncertain, there should be a process of evaluation that is not based on \"winning\" or \"losing\".A second possible reason for Westminster politicians to be so incompetent is that many are very poorly educated. To go from an expensive private school to Oxford, where  weeks a year for three years may be spent studying a subject of little or no practical relevance to le on this planet, is not a useful preparation for decision-making in a technically complex world. This is exacerbated by going straight into politics, buoyed by a high level of self-confidence and not the smallest notion of what le is like for those who have to earn a living. Perhaps the worst aspect of this career path is that the ones who end up leading the pack are those with the most confidence, not the clearest thinkers.A third possible reason is that Oxford graduates tend to go back to their professors for advice. If the professors are purely theoretical in their analyses they will be unable to reflect the realities of le and all the real world uncertainties that affect the outcomes of policy decisions.A fourth potential reason is that le in politics is very stressful. This seems to lead to a kind of febrile state, in which the politician loses all contact with reality le becomes a merry-go-round, based on lies and pretence, with the object to become famous rather than to serve.These observations are not specic to one party or another. Whichever way you look at it, the Westminster system needs to be reformed.Roger Waigh, Helensburgh.FOR months you have given over a complete page to letters on Brexit even though Holyrood estimates the financial impact on Scotland will be around pound billion a year. However, there is scant discussion provided over the annual pound billion cost of a ban on gas as part of a zero carbon policy.What is of even more importance to Scottish consumers is who will pay these costsndash that is, is it the domestic consumer or will politicians insist that renewable energy is price-matched to the p unit cost of gas  Ian Moir, Castle Douglas."},{"url":null,"title":"move-midge-39-s-new-beastie-scotland","story":"But thanks to RSPB Scotland volunteer Sam Buckton, a few newcomers are stealing the limelight in the countryrsquos insect scene.Mr Buckton, a recent zoology graduate from the University of Cambridge, has uncovered  new species at the charityrsquos Loch Lomond nature reserve - including a wasp that has never been recorded in Scotland before.The -year-old set himself a challenge of finding  new species at the reserve this summer, but has now upped this to  as he has been so successful.Some of the species he has discovered are scarce in Scotland and many have never been recorded on any of the RSPBrsquos  nature reserves before anywhere in the UK.However, Mr Buckton believes he has only ldquoscratched the surface with his discoveries.He said: ldquoRSPB Scotlandrsquos Loch Lomond reserve was acquired relatively recently in , so we still have much to learn about the dferent species that call it home.ldquoAlthough the birds and plants on site are well-studied, other groups ndash particularly invertebrates ndash are relatively unknown.ldquoAs a large site with a wide array of habitats, Loch Lomond is likely to harbour a huge ersity of species, and the truth is, Irsquove just been scratching the surface with my surveys.ldquoMost of the new species Irsquove recorded are insects, which are often small and easily overlooked, but Irsquove also found other invertebrates such as gall mites, mosses, liverworts, lichens, parasitic fungi and flowering plants ndash even large trees!ldquoTwo of my favourite discoveries so far have been the strikingly coloured ichneumonid wasp Ichneumon stramentorand a moth called Brussels lace, an uncommon species which has been confirmed as a county first.Mr Buckton, originally from Kingrsquos Langley in Hertfordshire, arrived at the reserve in May as part of an RSPB Scotland residential volunteer scheme, inspired by a previous visit to Loch Lomond.His most unusual discovery - the striking Ichneumon stramentor wasp dfers from other wasps because it does not use its sting.It uses its long abdominal ldquoovipositor to lay its eggs inside moth caterpillars so that its larvae can eat their way out.Mr Bucktonrsquos other discoveries also include the reserversquos first Brussels lace moth, the ldquorare and sporadic yellow-faced bee, and the UKrsquos most northerly soldier beetle.The nature enthusiast is now excited to see what  the reserve has to offer and as he strives towards his new target.He said: ldquoThis challenge has really brought home to me the bioersity that RSPB reserves such as Loch Lomond provide a haven for, and it has also been a lot of fun.ldquoIrsquom excited to know what  is out there waiting to be discovered.  species, here we come!According to RSPB Scotland, many species, particularly invertebrates, are under-recorded across the UK, but even common wildle can be regularly overlooked.This means that dramatic declines, such as those seen in recent years with house sparrows and bumblebees, can take time to come to light.Paula Baker, RSPB Scotland site manager at Loch Lomond, said Mr Bucktonrsquos contribution was invaluable to the reserve.She said: ldquoWe know that this reserve is a particularly special site for wildle, not just birds, but across the board.ldquoWersquove already uncovered a few rarities through the years, such as spotted crake and the great otter spider, but the more records we have the better, even of relatively common species.ldquoI think Samrsquos remarkable, and we actually canrsquot put a value on his work.ldquoHaving records like these will not only help us to manage the reserve better going forwards, but they also give us a baseline to work from in the future.ldquoThey also allow us to monitor species to see how theyrsquore being effected by issues such as climate change.RSPB Scotland has been involved in the West Dunbartonshire site for seven years and has been working with Scottish Natural Heritageand the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park to protect the reserve.The charity has worked to restore the grassland and meadow on the site, providing good conditions for plants, insects, breeding birds and wintering wildfowl, such as geese.Along with SNH, they have also been working for many years to control invasive non-native plant species, such as Himalayan balsam and continue to work with them to eradicate these species along the course of the River Endrick.Volunteers and staff have also been working to improve the Aber bog on the sit.The habitat is currently in an unfavourable condition due to overgrown reed canary grass and thick, rank vegetation, but the charity is now working to clear it and plans to carry out surveys to analyse the results.The trails and nature hub at the site are open every day from am to pm, with regular events taking place throughout the summer, including wildflower wanders and summer holiday hunts, as well as personalised guided tours.Many conservation charities carry out regular wildle surveys to keep track of species across the UK.The RSPB has recently ran a Big Garden Birdwatch, which saw almost half a million Brits taking part to offer information on how garden wildle is doing.The results of the survey showed the house sparrow in top place, followed by the starling, the blue tit and the blackbird.The Butterfly Conservation has also launched a Big Butterfly Count, which runs until August.Last year, more than , people took part and it is hoped that even more will get involved this year.

At stake is more than poundm over the next eight years - and the partyrsquos perceived commitment to public ownership.Trade union RMT - already in dispute with Serco over its management of the Caledonian Sleeper train - has launched a bitter attack on what it called SNPrsquos ldquounhealthy relationship with the company, a claim which has angered government insiders.The union, one of few to support a Yes vote in the  referendum, has long been demanding that the in ferry argot - be fully nationalised.But its most recent attack came after a Serco subsidiary involved in electronic tagging of offenders was fined pound.m in fines and costs after a six-year investigation in to fraud and  accounting by the Serious Fraud Office. Serco has admitted to problems at the subsidiary and the SFO has welcomed steps it has taken to prevent their repetition.However, RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: ldquoOnce again, Serco, the specialists in failure, have been found out. Fraud and  accounting are serious offences that should make any Government think twice about using private companies to deliver essential public services.:Critics call for ferry overhaul following latest CalMac breakdownldquoYet Serco continue their incompetent handling of new rolling stock on the Caledonian Sleeper contract at RMT members and passengers expense without the prospect of any censure from the Scottish Government.ldquoAnd on leline ferries, Serco have never been required to state the profits they take out of Northern Isles Ferry Services contract they were awarded by the Scottish Government in .ldquoDespite this, Serco could be awarded the next NIFS contract in August, when MSPs are on holiday.ldquoWorkers, passengers and communities, especially in Orkney and Shetland, deserve the stability and certainty of a publicly operated and run ferry service, not another gamble on Serco Grouprsquos predatory empire.Serco earlier this month accepted the fine. Its chief executive, Nicholas Soames, said: ldquoThose of us who now run the business are mortied, embarrassed and angry that, in a period between six and nine years ago, Serco understated the level of profitability of its Electronic Monitoring contract in its reports to the Ministry of Justice.

There are only two potential candidates, Serco and CalMac, which operates Clyde and Hebridean ferries. A private ferry operator, however, is challenging the whole process on ldquostate aid grounds.The Scottish Government said RMT rhetoric on the Sercorsquos tagging controversy had nothing to do with ferries to Orkney and Shetland.A spokesman said: ldquoThese fines are completely unrelated to Sercorsquos contracts with the Scottish Government and attempts to connect them are misleading at best. Any bids submitted to the Scottish Government must follow robust procurement rules and be compliant with the financial requirements specied in the Invitation to Tender.Serco tried and failed to take CalMacrsquos west coast contract recently but robustly defended its performance on the northern routes.Stuart Garrett, Sercorsquos Managing Director at NorthLink Ferries, said ldquoOur track record of customer satisfaction, reliability, safety, community support and continuous improvement speaks for itself.

It is dficult to envisage a Brexit-tarnished Conservative Government seeing the need to do anything, especially one led by an Ultra Brexiter, no matter how opportunistic his Brexitism.However here would be an opportunity for the SNP Government, in spite of the fiscal challenges currently facing it, to show us what it is really made of. Here would be an urgent need for the spiritual communities to demonstrate what is truly at the core of their beliefs.I make no excuse for believing that Christians for instance ought to have a Jesus-inspired input into politics.John Milne, Uddingston.IT is somehow fitting and not a little ironic that the painful Greek tragedy that is Brexit should now become the burden of a man with a degree in Classics who has enabled much of the ision and uncertainty we now experience to take place.Boris Johnson will become Prime Minister of the UK this week, approved by the Tory party faithful, many of whom regard him as their saviour but regarded by the rest of the country as a mendacious and bungling buffoon. Martha Vaughans article on the gaffes of Mr Johnson,perceptively summarises the reasons why so many Britons await Mr Johnsons premiership with genuine anxiety and trepidation.The political carnage of Brexit has presented the ruthlessly ambitious Mr Johnson with his chance to lead Britain out of the EU and to \"take back control \"as his Leave campaign vowed to do. Unfortunately, both he and the very people who promised to take back control are utterly incapable of exercising it, even over themselves. The Brexit process is rudderless and currently careering towards the No Deal clf edge, the void filled only with empty and fancul rhetoric. For those of privilege like Mr Johnson and his acolyte, Jacob Rees-Mogg, social, economic and political consequences are irrelevant. Brexit is simply another Old Etonian game of chance where repercussions are for little people to suffer.In , on the eve of the referendum, Mr Johnson penned two columns for the Daily , one stating that the cost of Brexit would be too high and one passionately in favour of leaving the EU. He gambled on supporting and then leading the Leave campaign as the best course open to his political ambitions. He is obviously not and never will be, a conviction politician. Like President Trump, he has made a career out of mendacity and political and moral evasiveness. His farcical kipper debacle recently was yet another failed attempt to pillory EU laws and practices and present them as risible. As a journalist he routinely lied about such things, famously claiming that EU food standards would ban prawn cocktail crisps in Britain, leading to the usual hysterical headlines in the right-wing press.Our Prime Minister in waiting, like his friend Donald Trump, is an unprincipled opportunist, serial bungler and thrives on chaos. As mayor of London he left pound million worth of abandoned extravagant plans in his wake which were dismissed as the whims of an archetypal English eccentric. It is my belief that like the President, he is also a racist and no stranger to casual misogyny.We in Scotland must now prepare for one of the most reactionary governments in modern times. Mr Johnson cares little for the Union in reality and views our devolved parliament with a mixture of indference and contempt. He has little actual support even among Scottish Conservatives, with the exception of sycophants like Ross Thomson and Douglas Ross. Mr Johnsons premiership,left unchecked, could witness the end of the United Kingdom in the not too distant future.Owen Kelly, Stirling.NO doubt David Cameron was right when he saw Boris Johnson as a liability to be kept out of Scotland during the referendum campaign .

Even before the next incumbent of No  is announced we have had resignations and threats of resignation at the prospect of Boris Johnson becoming PM.Regarding Mr Rodenrsquos advise to Mr Johnsonthat on any future visit to Scotland, \"Mr Johnson must avoid appearing like a visiting foreign dignitary\", perhaps he should have given readers a reminder of the rather dismal record Mr Johnson has on foreign affairs.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"peace-tv-censored-ofcom-calling-gay-people-39-worse-animals-39","story":"Peace TV, based in Dubai, was found to have shown four programmes which breached Ofcom regulations on inciting crime, hate speech and abuse.The channel said the programmes were based on Islamic teachings.The regulator said one show - called Strengthening Your Family: The Valley of the Homosexuals - made reference to homosexual people dying \"from a disease they contracted because they are homosexual\" and said homosexuality was \"a very unnatural type of love that is energised by the influence of \".: Pensioners tumours wiped out by game-changing radiotherapy treatmentAccording to the Ofcom report, presenter Imam Qasim Khan said: \"Then they make laws now, the newest and most brash and insane laws, laws that protect homosexuals and even make it legal for them to marry each other.\"Men marrying men.

Armstrong took “one giant leap for mankind” when he became the first person to walk on the moon.Three years after that historic moment, the Ohio-born NASA astronaut who commanded Apollo  took another “small step” into the history books in Langholm, the ancestral home of Clan Armstrong.There, in the “Muckle Toon”, he became the first and only person to be awarded the freedom of the burgh.Accepting the honour, he told the audience: “It’s said that the most dficult place to be recognised is in one’s own home town. And I consider this, now, my home town.” Many craters on the Moon and Mars are named after Scottish scientists.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

It also provided me with a competitive activity at which I could shine a bit in a school environment which leant heavily towards rugby as way of le and ... religion. So I debated for my senior school years, then debated at university, eventually ending up as President of Debates at the University of Edinburgh. At school and university, I did well enough until we had to compete against the Glasgow schools – particularly the Catholic schools or, later, against Glasgow University. Then we were always massacred, slaughtered, gubbed – call it what you like. We lost.Then I became a teacher and, once again to avoid having to run about anywhere wet and muddy, I was ‘the debating coach’. For the first two or three years, the same thing happened – my boysdid well enough until they were mercilessly crushed by the dark forces of the West. Then in , Scottish teachers went on strike and only private schools, by and large, entered debating competitions – the biggest competition in Scotland saw the number of schools taking part fall from  to  in one year. : How to bridge Scotland’s attainment gap - Dr Geetha Marcus: ‘Traditional ethos’ in Scots schools hitting attainment gap fightMy boys won that year, but they knew, of course, that the giants were sleeping. And despite the great efforts of many iniduals teachers in state schools in Scotland, over the past  years success in debating has remained, very often, in the lap of independent schools, which only educate about five per cent of the Scottish pupil population.This is a great pity for all sorts of reasons and it’s now time to do something about it, which will complement the work being done already in a small but increasing number of state schools. Now is a good time, because of the Scottish Government’s laudable intention of closing the poverty-related attainment gap. Now, it’s a fact that lots of really able kids who come from more deprived backgrounds don’t do as well at school as their middle-class counterparts. There are , reasons for this, andyou would like to sit down with me, I could explain some of them over the course of a week or two. But one crucial reason, which can be summed up in one word, is confidence. And this is where the funny, wee, niche, extra-curricular activity of debating comes in – get a girl or boy to feel comfortable debating, and they will be comfortable in interviews for jobs or for uni they will feel comfortable about arguing politics they will be happier about answering in class and they will become, in this respect, like the articulate, confident middle-class students at more privileged schools. I feel a gap closing.That is why the two charities in Scotland which promote debating – the English-Speaking Union, which has run debating and public-speaking competitions for decades, and which also encourages oracy in other areas, and Scottish Schools Debating, a smaller charity which I helped to found  years ago, with the intention of ensuring that there was always a Scottish team in the World School Debating Championships, have come together in a project called ‘Speak Up Scotland!’. The object of this exciting programme is to take debating into schools which have no history – or at least no recent history – of debating, focussing particularly on schools in more deprived areas, through a series of workshops and competitions culminating, we hope, in a two or three-day ‘debate camp’ next summer which would be free for those kids who had participated in the earlier stages. The project, which is being run by the English-Speaking Union’s programmes officer, Jordan Pfotenhauer, a young South African law graduate, who has had success running debating programmes aimed at reducing inequality in his home country is off to a great start, with over  S and S pupils having already taken part in workshops in their schools, including the Wester Hailes Education Centre in Edinburgh, Baldragon Academy in Dundee and Annan Academy. Jordan says of the work so far: “Teaching S and S pupils around Scotland how to debate over the past few months has been an incredibly rewarding experience. It’s amazing to see these young people grow in confidence over the course of just one workshop, learning crucial communication and argumentation skills in the process. We’ve covered topics ranging from school lunches to nuclear non-proleration and are certainly in for a busy coming school year at this rate!” So it’s maybe time to refresh our outdated thinking about debating – a lot of people think of it as being a fairly nerdy activity and, in truth they have a point. But Donald Dewar, Malcolm Rkind, Alex Salmond, Ruth Davidson, Michael Gove, John Smith, David Steel ... etc etc ... were debaters at school and or university. And another cultural reference – in ‘Modern Family’ the nerdy debater Alex says to her beautul and very popular sister – “remember, Haley, that one day my friends will be your friends’ bosses”. All those of us involved in ‘Speak Up Scotland!’ are hoping that this will be a leline for some of Scotland’s least well-off young people to feel more confident and – who knows  – with that confidence aspire to be First Minister, or a university student, or simply someone who feels a bit better about themselves. If you would like to know more about ‘Speak Up Scotland!’ oryou work at or know of a school that might like to participate, then please contact Jordan or Gayle at the English-Speaking Union . The programme is delivered to schools entirely free and soyou, or your company or organisation, would like to help financially, then please access the ‘Speak Up Scotland!’ justgiving page – every donation really helps us give young Scots who need it more confidence.Cameron Wyllie, a retired headteacher, publishes a blog called A House in Joppa©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll four in 10 labour members support scottish independence","story":"Almost half of Labour members support Scottish independence despite the partys long-standing Unionism, a poll has suggested.A wide-ranging YouGov survey of more than , registered members of the party also found that two-thirds back Irish reunication.Labour was firmly opposed to a Yes vote in the  independence referendum, with former Chancellor Alastair Darling chosen to run the Better Together campaign.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the .

This, she says, will leave her struggling to make ends met.Following their benefits blunder, the department now plans to take the money from Mrs McLaughlin’s existing benefits, which she depends on to survive.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs McLaughlin told how she felt like she had “committed a crime” during her PIP assessment.“When I went for the PIP assessment I went to Citizens’ Advice to help us out and a girl came along to represent me,” she said.“She was talking me through it outside because I got myself up to high doh over it.“When I went in the pressure just got the better of me. I was being asked questions and some of them I found hard to answer. I answered to the best of my knowledge, but I felt asI had committed a crime and I was in front of a  of judges.”Despite winning her appeal, she must now pay back £. per fortnight out of her already meagre benefits. As well as the impact on her mental health, Mrs McLaughlin said she will “struggle” just to make ends meet.“The only thing we had to live off was ESA, which was only £ between us,” she said.“Why are they sending us this letter a year later saying that we have to pay the money back  It came as a complete shock. I rang and explained the circumstances, but I was just told that I have to pay it back by law. I understand that they gave us the money to pull us through, but why did they leave it for a year and let it mount up  At the end of the day the fault lies with them, but we are the ones being penalised. She put me onto a debt management line and I was toldI didn’t agree to pay it then they would start taking it out of my benefits anyway because my money comes from them.“We’re trying to run a house, we have oil and food to pay for, we don’t have a car but we have buses and taxi fares to pay for too. It puts me under a lot of pressure. I was trying to work out what it’s going to cost me and it’s going to take over a year and a half to pay it. I don’t know how I’m going to afford it. I received a letter a few months ago about going back to work. I can’t start work due to my health issues, and I only have another year left on my ESA – I have to re-appeal that. I don’t knowI’m going to get it back or not, so how am I going to make these payments ”She added: “I was only starting to relax and feel a bit better lately. I’m on a lot of medication for it. This has put a lot of pressure on me. I was in a complete state over this letter, but there’s nothing I can do – they’re going to take the money anyway.”A spokesperson for the Department for Communities, said: “Welfare Supplementary Payments are available to existing Disability Living Allowance claimants who experiences a loss of benefit following a reassessment to Personal Independence Paymenthowever depending on a person’s circumstances they may be entitled to more than one type of WSP arising from loss of DLA.“Claimants who do not qualy for PIP and subsequently successfully appeal the decision receive Welfare Supplementary Payments equal to the weekly rate of their previous Disability Living Allowance payments. In the event of a successful appeal and in line with the legislation the Department carries out an adjustment on any arrears due to ensure that an overpayment does not occur hence the claimant does not lose out financially.“However, in some circumstances e.g. where a WSP is paid for loss of a Carers Premium the legislation does not provide for an offset process to allow arrears of Carers Allowance benefit to be adjusted following a successful PIP appeal. Instead all arrears of Carers Allowance must be paid to the carer and recovery of the overpayment of the WSP sought from the person who actually received it however again in these circumstance neither the claimant nor the carer has lost out financially.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rte to broadcast glenanne film","story":"RTÉ is to broadcast a documentary by a West Belfast film-maker about the notorious loyalist Glenanne Gang, believed to be responsible for over  sectarian killings of Catholics during the Troubles, mainly in counties Armagh and Tyrone.Unquiet Graves will air next week, July  at .pm.The Glenanne Gang, which also contained members of the legal British Army UDR among its number, was also responsible for the Dublin-Monaghan bombings which killed  civilians in May , as well as the Miama Showband massacre in .Seán Murray’s film– which is narrated by the Oscar-nominated actor Stephen Rea – has previously been shown at An Chultúrlann and at the Movie House cinema in Belfast.Murray tweeted: “I can now announce that Unquiet Graves will be screening on RTÉ  on Monday the th of July at .pm. “This is of immense importance to the #Glenanne families# and is a major milestone on the road to justice.

This is more important than anything  they are currently looking at because thousands of jobs are at stake on both sides of the border.\"Mr Armstrong, a former chair of the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, was one of the few pro-Brexit voices in the business world. He said he still believed that the UKs future was best served by leaving the EU.\"The current withdrawal agreement has already been rejected by the House of Commons and is not likely to be accepted in future,\" he added.\"The question is how can the backstop be removed and replaced with a final deal that can keep open borders on the island of Ireland and at the same time within the UK.\"Ireland took a hardline decision over the backstop that could well finish with the very result that they said they were determined to avoid, a no-deal Brexit. \"Since Ireland decided not to take advantage of a possible deal with the UK, it is now time to consider the possibility of Northern Ireland trying to agree a deal that would allow them to trade freely with both the EU and Britain and also to take advantage of any future trade deals entered into by the UK.\"Mr Armstrong said thatNorthern Ireland agreed to meet EU single market regulations, there would be little dficulty in identying goods made here and their manufacturing standard.He added: \"Northern Ireland manufacturers could be issued with a licence to use a logo and an identier that confirmed that the goods were made here, had a minimum added value and only contained approved components or ingredients. \"It could be more complex to police animals or animal products that enter the food chain from Britain. \"But, with current levels of traceability to a specic location in Northern Ireland as to where animals or animal products were raised or produced, it is not an insurmountable issue.\"Mr Armstrong saidthe backstop was replaced with such an agreement, the withdrawal agreement should pass through Parliamentthe DUP accepted that \"a minor concession\" over the checking of goods in Northern Ireland manufacturers was worth getting a deal that would bring \"major economic benefits to Northern Ireland\".He added: \"The ability to trade in the EU, the UK and any countries that the UK enters into would make Northern Ireland a very attractive inward investment location, especiallythe reduction in corporation tax that has already been legislated for was introduced. \"Concessions by the EU, UK and political parties in Northern Ireland - for a population that is less than half of one per cent of the EU population - would seem to only require very minor modications to current legislations and allow a full UK-EU trade deal to be negotiated over a much longer period.\"Meanwhile, the chairman of the Governments Industrial Strategy Council has said that Brexit deadlock is undermining efforts to boost the UK economy.Andy Haldane told BBC Newsnight it was \"plausible\" that one of the \"costs of Brexit is that not as much other stuff has happened as night\".Mr Haldane, who is also chief economist of the Bank of England, said: \"In the absence of Brexit, might more have been done  Perhaps.\"Asked about his concerns on a no-deal, Mr Haldane referred to the banks analysis from last year which suggested that, in a worst case scenario, such a rupture could trigger a deep recession."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar to seek urgent talks with new prime minister on backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A number of sources in Dublin have said they believe Mr Johnson is not as committed to a disorderly Brexit as portrayed. Read MoreSuzanne Breen: What DUP really thinks of Boris JohnsonHowever, they believe the message that the EU will not cave on the backstop \"needs to be hammered home\". The Taoiseach is expected to speak to the incoming Prime Minister at some stage this week - and a meeting may be possible in the coming weeks. The Irish Government has always been keen not to engage in direct negotiations with the UK on Brexit - but officials see some value in outlining the value of the backstop directly to Mr Johnson. Any negotiations have been handled by the EU team led by Michel Barnier. Key to Mr Johnsons campaign was a promise to scrap the Irish backstop and renegotiate the withdrawal agreement achieved by Theresa May. Tanaiste Simon Coveney said the Irish Government will have to work with \"whoever the British Prime Minister is\". \"Unfortunately Ireland is in a vulnerable and exposed position,\" Mr Coveney said, adding that the withdrawal agreement is \"balanced and fair\". He said the Irish Government would work with London to look at an \"innovative way to try get us past this impasse\". It comes as a prominent critic of Boris Johnson quit the Government yesterday. Sir Alan Duncan resigned from the Foreign Office on the eve of the Tory leadership announcement and set out a plan for an early Commons test of Mr Johnsons authority which could have prevented him entering Number . Sir Alan launched an effort to hold an emergency Commons debate on the new Tory leader, a move which could have potentially dealt Mr Johnson a fatal blow before he formally took office.But he said Commons Speaker John Bercow had turned down his application for such a debate after the leadership result is announced today but before the new Prime Minister is approved by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. If it had been allowed to go ahead, MPs would have been given the chance to consider \"the merits of the newly chosen leader of the Conservative Party\" and - crucially - whether the Commons \"supports his wish to form a Government\". Whoever wins the Tory leadership race will have to govern with a Tory-DUP majority of just two."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38177671.ece/3cb03/BINARY/nolanweightloss.jpg","title":"bbcs stephen nolans weight loss dramatically saved his life says health expert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It said the submarine’s operational deployment “is near at hand”.The construction of a new submarine suggests North Korea has been increasing its military capability despite nuclear diplomacy with the US that began early last year.North Korea has repeatedly said it is willing to abandon its nuclear programme infor political and economic benefits.But there has been little public progress despite the most recent Trump-Kim meeting, and the North’s release of the submarine photos could be a way to both increase pressure on the United States ahead of any renewed talks and remind its rival of its demands.North Korea wants widespread relief from harsh US-led sanctions infor pledging to give up parts of its weapons programme, but the United States is demanding greater steps toward disarmament before it agrees to relinquish the leverage provided by the sanctions.It was not known exactly what kind of submarine North Korea has built. But its efforts to develop submarine-launched missile systems are a serious concern for rivals and neighbours because missiles from submerged vessels are harder to detect in advance.Before it entered talks with the United States, North Korea claimed to have successfully test-fired ballistic missiles from submarines, though many outside analysts say the country remains years away from having an operational system.According to a South Korean defence report in , North Korea has  submarines and submersibles."},{"url":null,"title":"singapore seizes tonnes of elephant tusks and pangolin scales","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"statistics reveal missed targets department concedes ambulance service currently resourced","story":"The department of health has conceded that the current level of demand on the ambulance service exceeds available resources.The ambulance service has been dealing with a surge in emergency calls over recent years.Newly published Department of Healthstatistics reveal that between   and  , the number of emergency calls received by the NIAS increased by , from , to ,.In   the Western Local Commissioning Groupalone, which takes in Derry, received , calls – almost  a day.Aside from the Belfast LCG, the ambulance service in the Western area received the highest number of calls in the past year based on per ,-population.Category A calls are immediately le threatening and receive the NIAS’s highest priority with a performance target of arriving at .% of these calls within  minutes.During the last five years in NI, the percentage of Category A calls responded to within  minutesdecreased from .% in   to .% in  In   all LCGs fell well below this target, with the Western Trust the second-best performer at just .%.From December  to March  the performance across Northern Ireland has deteriorated.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

Ballynahinch is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular and we need to see work on the bypass starting as soon as possible, he said.Cllr Walker argued that the current congestion is hampering new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and believes the provision of the new bypass represents a ldquowin win for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down close in on last four  ","story":"DOWN camogs took another step towards qualication for the semi-finals when they blitzed Carlow at Pairc Esler on Saturday afternoon.The home side started in a hurry and stormed into a - to - interval lead, Carlowrsquos only scores coming from two pointed frees.Down were strong in all departments, but they had the star of the show in Portaferryrsquos Niamh Mallon, who helped herself to -, with only three points coming from frees.Mallon received great support from Castlewellanrsquos Sorcha McCartan who helped set Down on their way with a cracking goal in the th minute to put her side - to - clear.Mallon grabbed Downrsquos second goal just after the break and a double from Catherine McGourty was the icing on the cake as the Downmanagement team emptied their bench.The only negative on the day came when Sara Louise Carr had to leave the action in the first half with what appeared to be a calf injury and she must now be a serious doubt for the big game with Derrry on July .Down sit top of their group alongside Tipperary with Derry only a point behind and a win against their Ulster rivals would surely secure a place in the last four.Down -Carlow -ALL-IRELAND ICC.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C July 17%2C 1979  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN mdash Stormont officials were keeping tight-lipped this week about the prospect of finding new employment for  workers who have been dramatically paid off at two textile factories in the Castlewellan area.Redundancy notices went sent out last week to employees of the Moss Lane Spinning Company in Castlewellan and Standard Mills of Annsborough mdash but there is a chance they may be re-employedmoves to attract a new company to the vacated premises are successful.The official receiver, Mr Noel Stewart, who is the man heading the search for a new owner, said the two factories mdash operating as a joint company mdash had been plagued by ldquocatastrophic losses during the last  months.He stressed that he was optimistic that a new owner will be found and said the Department of Commerce had indicated that it will give every assistance to get the factories open again.A spokesman for the Department would only say that efforts were being made to get factories re-opened, but would not state the level of success.ldquoWe are trying to get another company to move into the premises at Castlewellan and Annsborough, but I am not prepared to say more than that at the moment, he said.Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill, slammed the decision to close the factories and said it was a disaster for the area.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted immediate action to cope with the grim unemployment problem facing the people of Castlewellan and Annsborough.ldquoThe overall situation was poor before this dramatic turn of affairs, but the close of these two factories makes the situation disastrous, he said.ldquoThere is now no worthwhile employment opportunity on any reasonable scale in the area. This is a situation which calls for immediate action by all relevant government departments, public bodies and interested parties to encourage, promote and attract new employment to the area, he added.BRYANSFORD mdash On a day when there were ten separate attacks on Post Office property throughout the province, Bryansford Post Office was the target for a terrorist bomb and several post office cables in the area were cut.Last Tuesday the telephone operator received an anonymous callfrom a male at .am warning that a bomb had been planted at the post office.Local police went to the scene where they found that a booby-trap bomb had been left in a waste paper basket outside. An Army technical officer later arrived and the bomb was successfully defused.Around the same time Post Office cables were cut at Dromara Road and Castlewellan Road in Clough.NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastle would be overwhelmed by a wave of crime and vice during the holiday period proved unfounded, with the resort enjoying an ldquoextremely quiet period.The RUC said before the Twelfth holidays began that they would be swamping the provincersquos major holiday resorts, including Newcastle, in a bid to crack down on the growing problems of teenage drinking and drug-taking.Newcastle had no major incidents or arrests, except for four Belfast youths who are helping police with their inquiries into shoplting at the Gt House of Mourne on July .A police spokesman stressed, however, that patrols were stepped up during the holiday period, especially during weekends, chiefly because the population of the resort doubled during the summer months.Police said violence was the most common side effect of teenage drinking and they had asked publicans, off licence owners and hotels to be extra vigilant.The spokesman added that the police determination to crack down could only succeed with the help of the people who sold the drink.KILLYLEAGH mdash The Dunmore Hotel in Killyleagh changed hands over the holiday period and it may also be changing its name. The new owners are Mr Paul Green and his we Nancy, from Killinchy, and they have taken over the hotel from Mr Harry Briggs.The hotel was sold for an undisclosed sum of money, but it is believed to be in six figures. The new owners intend to extend and renovate the hotel, but hope that all work can be carried out without closing down the hotel.The short term plans include adding nine new bedrooms at the rear and extensively renovating the present accommodation.The owners intend to keep the present name for the time being, but they are contemplating reverting to the original name of the hotel, lsquoThe Treesrsquo.STRANGFORD mdash Shore sports proved every bit as popular as the sailing events at Strangford Regatta last week.Hundreds of holidaymakers flocked to the village to watch people of all age groups taking part in a host of events in the hot summer sun.The wide spectrum of events made it a day of fierce competition and fun for competitors and spectators alike and the organisers say they were amazed at the success of the sporting programme.Events included a fancy dress competition, round the houses race, rowing race and races for married men and women. Amusements were also provided for the children.PORTAFERRY mdash The Strangford to Portaferry swim was one of the highlights of Portaferry Gala Week, which began on Sunday and continues through until Saturday.The swim against the current, which is believed to be one of the fastest in Europe, took the most out of all eight competitors, who ranged in age from  to .But for Jacqui McIntyre, of Bangor Swimming Club, the swim proved comparatively easy. With her time of  minutes and  seconds, she won the ladiesrsquo section and also recorded the fastest time overall.The gala began on Sunday with a fun run and boat sea angling competition. It concludes this Saturday with the final of the talent competition and an open air dance.MOURNES mdash The Mourne Mountains are alive to the sound of music mdash music with a message which is about building bridges across the world.The area was the cockpit for an international roadshow arranged and rehearsed at break-neck speed around camp fires.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme. The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years. Among the Northern Ireland firms making the last in previous years include First Derivatives and Novosco. A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
