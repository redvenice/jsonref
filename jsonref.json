Mr Fleming advised people to shop around for offers from other utility providers and suppliers, ‘rather than just complaining about what the Government is going to do for me’. Photograph: Cyril ByrneWe’ve never met but I couldn’t help but notice when you barged onto the Pricewatch patch this week and started making all sorts of headlines after telling people how they needed to shop around to ensure they would be able to make ends meet in the face of the highest spike in prices in decades.Now, I mean no disrespect but, seriously? Shopping around is my thing. It’s been my thing for years. So I’m not going to lie, I was miffed by your mini home economics lecture delivered on Drivetime although in truth, my annoyance didn’t last long.Almost as soon as you started speaking to presenter Sarah McInerney on Monday evening about what people might be able to do to counter inflation, it was clear things were not going to go well.While what you had to say was nowhere near as brazen as the lecture delivered by Charlie Haughey in the early 1980s when he chastised everyone except himself for living way beyond their means or as ridiculous as the claim made by Leo Varadkar that his was the party for people who get up early in the morning, it was still pretty tone deaf.In fact, it could scarcely have been more tone deaf, something that was immediately clear to McInerney. She gave you more than one chance to stop digging the ridiculous hole you were digging for yourself and she could scarcely hide her exasperation as you talked. But you ploughed on despite her incredulous pauses, deep sighs and direct challenges.“If you move around you can get better prices, and that’s in our own hands,” you said and pointed out that weekly shopping bills could be reduced if people were “careful” about where they shop.Here’s the thing Seán, there is a time and a place for sage advice, the like of which you were dispensing, and you got both wrong.You were being asked why the Government was moving so slowly to introduce measures that might help people out of a desperate situation and instead of answering that question in a way that might offer anything by way of hope to many thousands of people, you started sounding like some class of poor man’s Marie Antoinette, urging people who are struggling to stay warm and put food on their tables to eat cake.You could almost hear the Opposition mercilessly cackling as you told people – or, to use another word for them, voters – what they needed to do. Labour and Sinn Féin practically fell over each other as they raced to put the boot in.You deserved the kicking and I say that as someone who is on your side, at least when it comes to the business of finding the best value for money.For more than 15 years on the pages of The  I have been banging on about the need for people to shop around and I fully intend to do more of it in the days ahead. Because I know that for many people there are ways they can save themselves hundreds – if not thousands – of euro each year by just being a bit more canny.But there is a big but here and one that you seemed to forget.Yes, there are savings on the table for many people but there are many others who have been stretched as far as they can be stretched, people with absolutely no wiggle room when it comes to cutting back.There are hundreds of thousands of people who don’t have the luxury of shopping around when it comes to health insurance for the very simple reason that they can’t afford health insurance.There are many thousands more who can’t shop around for cheaper gas or electricity because they are saddled with huge legacy bills or tied to pay-as-you-go meters which often charge far more than the discounted rates that are available to people such as you and me.And they can’t shop around for food anymore because they are already put to the pin of their collar and already buying the cheapest food options they can find.Now you did apologise and you apologised fast. Would that the Government of which you are a member acted with such haste when it came to rolling out the financial supports that so many people desperately need."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"the secret teacher i often correct work that has clearly been dictated","story":"With grinds, the very last thing a student who is not working hard enough needs is yet another person working hard on their behalf. Photograph: iStockIn absolute terms our national expenditure on education looks eye-watering. Yet we seem to be making a habit of coming bottom of the OECD rankings for investment in education. Why?Whatever the importance and scale of other items on the expenditure list, the largest single item is salaries of school staff. As a profession, we teachers feel the full weight of every non-teacher’s expertise on all things pedagogical. We live with the total oxymoron of everyone claiming to know all about what we do while simultaneously demonstrating an entire arsenal of evidence that they have never ever stood in front of a class of young people.Many who have done so end up leaving teaching, proving that the fantastic holidays do not balance out the pressures and demands involved in our role. However undeniably wonderful the volume of time away from the classroom might be, those of us who are committed and delivering full value know that we have earned every moment of it.As public servants it is important that we deliver value, and that our fellow taxpayers feel they are getting good bang for their buck. The best way to get that is to look after us, to ensure that we are able to perform optimally. The open abuse the teaching profession is subjected to runs entirely counter to that.For many, when your name is already mud it’s hard to see the incentive in attempting to convert the deep-rooted doubter. It is too often entirely evident that there is no point in trying. I know numerous teachers who actively avoid saying what they do for a living until it is absolutely necessary. Interestingly, they are among the cream of the crop and have earned reputations for their excellence. They give of their best as a matter of conscience.If we have unhappy public servants, and taxpayers who are unhappy with their public servants, isn’t that better addressed than shoved under the carpet? The reality is, we as taxpayers appear slow to ask for more and better of our teachers.A number of alternative avenues seem more appealing.Astronomical feesPaying for the same service a second time elsewhere is most definitely one. Enrolments in fee-paying schools exceeded 26,200 this year, reaching an all-time high. Despite demanding fees of between €5,000 and €10,000 for day pupils, many of these schools have waiting lists. €15,000 is not unusual for five-day boarding, nor €20,000 for seven-day boarding. What makes so many so ready to pay astronomical fees for something they are entitled to courtesy of their taxes?Grinds feature further down the scale but are nonetheless big business. While I’m in no doubt that there are many effective private teachers out there, I’m in even less doubt about how many are doing more damage than good. Parents rush to suggest that they will “get her a grind”, and I usually wince at how obvious it is that they have completely missed my point.The very last thing a student who is not working hard enough needs is yet another person working hard on their behalf. Grinds are far too often well-intentioned but disempowering. Many parents are so relieved to find someone available that they do not find out enough about that person’s suitability. And the youngster getting the one-to-one assistance is not best placed to filter what they are being told.When I see evidence that a student may be being poorly served, I offer to speak to their private teacher. Only once in my career has that offer been accepted and on that occasion the person was entirely suitable. He proved himself an excellent collaborator when we liaised and worked together for our mutual student’s benefit.Regrettably, I often correct work which has clearly been dictated, and which my student has little hope of being able to reproduce and understands only minimally, if at all.When engaging a private teacher and investing additional funds in what is already available via your child’s school, it is essential to establish that person’s suitability for preparing for the specific exam your child will take. We teachers engage in a lot of training for a reason, but there is every chance that the teacher you are paying privately is not accessing that training. In that situation, there is every reason to ensure that you are getting your money’s worth. You could very well be paying someone to unhelpfully contradict what is in fact correct.Keeping schtumWhile we Irish have a reputation for staying quiet and not wanting to make a fuss, there are limits. It is one thing to go out for a meal and decide to keep quiet about being dissatisfied. Chances are, you’ll simply never return to that restaurant. To clearly see flaws in how we provide for educating our youth and yet let those flaws remain makes little sense. Isn’t this precisely the time to seek only the very best? Does it honestly make more sense to keep schtum and throw good money after bad? Or worse still, bad money after bad?It is time we established an inclusive forum for open and courageous exchange around how Ireland could “do” education better. These days mental health, wellbeing and leadership are increasingly linked to growth and learning, which is what our young people are at school for. In the interest of serving them better, that forum would do well to conduct a thorough audit of what we are currently doing and explore ways to improve both what we offer and how we rank in terms of education."},{"url":null,"title":"retrofitting tales it s a bit like a boat you can t just fix one hole","story":"Davin Larkin and Niki Byrne bought a typical rural bungalow outside Oughterard in Co Galway and successfully completed a deep retrofitDavin Larkin and Niki Byrne bought a typical rural bungalow outside Oughterard, Co Galway. It was damp, with two heating systems, poor light and minimal insulation, with an F energy rating – “F for freezing,” they point out.“It was a roof over our heads but it did not feel particularly homely,” Niki recalls. Over five years, they sought to upgrade their home themselves in a step-by-step way, but this proved too difficult.They decided to go for a complete retrofit with specialist help – a project managed by Electric Ireland Superhomes (EIS) which began in November 2020 but was then delayed by Covid lockdown. They eventually had a transformed home with an A2 energy grading last October.Niki describes the outcome as “a totally different way of living” with a constant 20-degree temperature, no draughts and no need to have to constantly close doors.Constancy of temperature does not mean “roasting”, she explains, as the combination of insulation and ventilation, as well as heating using an air-to-water heat pump, make for a perfectly sealed building – compared to using fossil fuels to drive temperature up as required.Because of the extra works, it cost €65,000, while they got an SEAI grant of €20,000. But engaging EIS meant it did the grant application and paid contractors while easing worry over providing upfront funds. A key element of the Government’s retrofit programme involves scale-up of this type of one-stop-shop option.In one goDavin advises doing a retrofit in one go if possible, though he accepts this will not be possible for everybody. In their case, it meant having to rent for a few months.Their first electricity bill was €380 for two months. “If that is as bad as it gets in winter, that’s pretty good,” he believes. It covers “heating and hot water 247 and other electricity use”.Cormac Madden and his wife, Mary O’Toole, upgraded their four-bedroom Co Dublin home, starting in 2016 and managing to make incremental improvements. The original two-storey semi-detached house had a BER rating of G in 1996, when they first moved in.The house was built around 1960, “the worst possible period of house construction in Ireland in terms of energy rating”, Cormac notes. It’s a cavity-block construction with suspended wooden floors.Over the years they installed double-glazed windows, and external wall and attic insulation to achieve a C1 BER. “There were many reasons to consider further energy upgrades: lower energy and heating bills, improved warmth and comfort,” he says, but they really wanted to move away from fossil fuels.He became a believer in the “whole house” approach. “You really need to look at the energy performance of all of the elements in a house that impact heat loss and energy efficiency. It’s a bit like a boat: you can’t just fix one hole – the boat will still sink unless all of the holes are repaired.”StressfulHaving had some construction projects that were challenging and stressful in the past, “it was invaluable to have the support of Electric Ireland Superhomes in particular to source the contractor and project manage the work.”The overall experience was positive but there were some timing issues the only challenging period was when they were without heat for a few days during November.Their home energy report recommended fabric upgrades such as cavity wall insulation, attic insulation and high-performing external doors. An existing gas boiler was replaced with a thermostatically controlled air source heat pump.An airtightness target of less than 5 air changes per hour was achieved, complemented by a “demand-controlled ventilation system” to ensure healthy air circulation and moisture control. Solar PV helped improve the BER to A3.Cormac rejects any suggestion that heat pumps are unsuitable for older homes. “It’s transformational – and such a lovely way to live: constant and cost-efficient heat and full comfort . . . In the future it won’t be a new kitchen that will be the object of desire that people will save up for, it will be a heat pump.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s covid figures are decreasing due to population immunity expert says","story":"The State’s Covid figures are decreasing despite more mixing following the lifting of restrictions. File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTrinity College Dublin professor of population health medicine Noel McCarthy said population immunity explains why the State’s Covid-19 figures are going down despite the fact that people are mixing more. He said he was “95 per cent certain” that a new, more transmissible and dangerous variant of Covid-19 than Omicron will not appear, and therefore there will be no more lockdowns. His comments come as an additional 28,166 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in recent days, according to the latest figures released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. This total includes new case figures for Saturday, Sunday and Monday, with the numbers continuing to trend downwards in this regard. On Saturday 10,977 new cases were reported, including 6,260 cases confirmed through a PCR test and 4,717 through an antigen test. On Sunday the figure was 8,736, including 4,933 cases confirmed through a PCR test and 3,803 through an antigen test. Monday’s figure was 8,453, including 3,975 cases confirmed through a PCR test and 4,478 through an antigen test. As of 8am on Monday there were 643 people in hospital with Covid-19, of whom 76 are in ICU. Milder infectionsProf McCarthy said the pattern of milder infections which has been a feature of currently dominant Omicron variant is likely to continue for the foreseeable future and will not pose a serious threat to public health. “My expectations coming out of the pandemic is that we won’t have the experiences we have had of the last two years again,” he said. “We may have other experiences of immunity waning and outbreaks waiting to happen and have to go in with mop-up vaccinations. “We may end up like Omicron with a lot of disease but not much severe disease. We will be seeing rapid vaccination rather than the closure of society. Society can run its normal functions.” Prof McCarthy predicted that a pilot seroprevalence study in the State that will begin in mid-February will show “stellar levels of immunity” in the population. This will be as a result of vaccination and prior infections with Covid-19. Prof McCarthy said society would have to be “incredibly unlucky” for another variant to come along that would be as transmissible as Omicron and as virulent as Delta.Public transport Meanwhile, commuter traffic and public transport use remain well below pre-pandemic levels despite the general reopening of society. While Covid-19 restrictions on returning to the office have been removed, the figures would suggest that many people are continuing to work from home.Early figures suggest that daily passenger numbers on public transport remain down 40 per cent on early 2020. The National Transport Authority (NTA), the co-ordinating body for public transport in the State, estimates that before the pandemic it carried 1 million passengers per day. That figure is down to 600,000. Those figures include passengers on Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Go Ahead, Luas, Irish Rail and local link services. However, weekends are much busier, averaging between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.Bus Éireann spokeswoman Elizabeth Headon said regional city services are “touching 100 per cent” of pre-pandemic passenger levels in Galway, Limerick and Athlone. The regional rural bus services are at 85 per cent of their pre-pandemic levels and rising, she added, but commuter services to and from the greater Dublin area are not as strong. In the last week of February 2020, before restrictions were imposed, Dublin Bus was carrying an average of 478,626 passengers a day. That figure for the first full week after restrictions were lifted on January 22nd was 319,411, a decrease of one-third on pre-pandemic levels. In terms of passenger numbers, Dublin Bus and Go Ahead Ireland commuter bus services together are operating at two-thirds of what they were before the pandemic. Irish Rail was carrying 143,625 passengers on Monday, March 3rd, 2020, before the pandemic was declared. The equivalent figure on Monday, January 31st, was 90,366. Passenger numbers on Luas services are 60 per cent of what they were pre-pandemic. Traffic volumesTransport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) figures show traffic volumes growing notably since the lifting of restrictions last month.Traffic was up by 5 per cent on February 4th on the M4 between Celbridge and Maynooth and on the M1 between the M50 and Dublin Airport in comparison with the previous Friday, January 28th. It was up by 3 per cent on the M50 between the Navan Road and Galway Road junctions and by 1 per cent on the N40 Cork ring road. However, generally traffic volumes were down between 11 and 17 per cent on the same day in February 2020 before the first pandemic restrictions came into place. Traffic on the N6 Bóthar na dTreabh main road into Galway city is down by 23 per cent on 2020, the N40 into Cork is down by 17 per cent, the M1 into Dublin 14 per cent and the N7 at Citywest is down by 12 per cent. Traffic on peripheral roads monitored by TII in counties Donegal, Leitrim and Cavan is now approaching pre-pandemic levels. HGV traffic on Irish roads is back to pre-pandemic levels.TII spokesman Sean O’Neill said figures would appear to indicate that car traffic volumes generally are returning to pre-pandemic levels, but many people are still opting to work from home.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"how ireland s military would look under proposed overhaul","story":" The commissioning ceremony of 68 new Army Officers, 2 Air Corps Officers and 8 Maltese Officers at the Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh Camp in 2018.

BP announced profits of £9.5 billion shortly after Shell posted what it called “momentous” record annual takings. These huge sums are a function of the restart of the world economy after the pandemic shutdowns but are pretty mind-boggling none the less. For the green lobby they indicate that more needs to be done and faster to expedite the move to non-carbon fuel sources.For the rest of us, however, they demonstrate that the UK’s rush to achieve net zero is not being followed by the rest of the world and cannot be sustained here without a massive public backlash. The baleful consequences of this policy are finally beginning to dawn on the Government. As we reported yesterday, final approval is to be granted for six new North Sea oil and gas fields, the first sensible decision on meeting the country’s energy needs taken for at least three decades.It also gives the lie to the claim that investment in new fields was halted for economic considerations when the principal objections were environmental. For the same reason, the Government should lift the ban on fracking.The prospect of new licences in the North Sea marks a significant political push-back against net zero, with Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, seemingly determined to make the policy more rational and voter-friendly. Some of the more unrealistic targets for phasing out petrol cars or banning gas boilers need to be revisited as well.In any case, the UK is able to claim a fall in CO2 emissions in part because it outsources them elsewhere. Refusing to exploit our own reserves of gas while importing it from countries that have no renewable energy to speak of is mendacious. Continuing to import goods from countries that still burn vast amounts of coal surely does not help the planet in any way.In these circumstances, it is idiotic to withhold approval to exploit Britain’s own oil and gas supplies in the North Sea, even if it does turn out to be the last hurrah for what was once seen as the nation’s economic salvation.History repeats itself. The arrival of natural gas in the 1960s required the conversion of around 14 million households previously reliant on so-called town gas produced by burning coal. The newcomer was cleaner, cheaper and less noxious. A similar upheaval is envisaged to remove gas boilers and install energy efficient heat pumps. Some 85 per cent of the UK’s 29 million homes are heated by gas-fired boilers and the Government wants about one million to be replaced every year by 2030 compared to just 60,000 last year.How can this be brought about? The answer is that it can’t, not least because the engineers are not available and the costs to homeowners already hit by soaring energy bills are too high. It is estimated that 60,000 qualified plumbers will be needed to meet 2028 installation targets – yet just 1,800 have the correct training today. The new pumps will also be expensive, about £8,000-£10,000 for a typical three-bed home.Even if costs are brought down, this is a sizeable outlay. In another market intervention, the Government is now offering incentives for people to switch and seeking to force boiler-makers to sell a certain proportion of heat pumps to “help create the conditions for rapid innovation”.Amid all this lunacy comes evidence that the proposed move to greater electrification risks power cuts without significant changes in behaviour (leave aside what might happen if supplies are affected by a war in eastern Europe or the Gulf or both). From this week, households are to be paid to ration their power usage at peak times to relieve pressure on the National Grid as part of a trial to encourage people to charge cars and use appliances at different times during the day and night. That is why we were all being urged to switch to smart meters and move to special tariffs, though these have now been scuppered by the rise in prices.All in all, our energy policy has been an unmitigated mess for decades, with incessant governmental interference in the market and a failure to invest in nuclear power and fracking leaving us dangerously exposed to price hikes and supply crunches. The driving force behind most of our problems is the 2050 net zero target now underpinned by statute law and international treaty commitments.Every political party is signed up to this, as are most countries in the world, even though few expect it to happen. Here, the politics are potentially toxic as people see bills rise, costs increase, supplies diminish and sanctions applied while the biggest CO2 producers carry on burning oil and coal. Labour may be just as culpable for this but the governing party always gets the blame.Since natural gas accounts for more than half our primary energy consumption – and yet we import more than half of what we require – reviving North Sea investment is a no-brainer. Even the EU now recognises gas as a sustainable energy source to be used in the transition to a low carbon future.It will take time to get new rigs running, which is not going to help alleviate the Government’s immediate problems. But international instability shows that we need to secure our energy supplies in the long-term through exploiting (and storing) our own gas reserves, moving to hydrogen, investing in small nuclear reactors, expanding carbon capture and storage, and lifting the moratorium on fracking.There are signs that, apart from shale, this prudent mix is beginning to come together but it will need the Government to stand up to the green lobby in a way that it has so far been unwilling to do. We can move to a lower carbon future, but to do so by impoverishing the country and risking its energy supplies is madness.Moreover, it is feeding into the debate around Boris Johnson’s future. Many Tory MPs are less concerned about lockdown parties or injudicious remarks concerning Sir Keir Starmer’s prosecution record than the impact of high energy prices on the incomes of their constituents. The Prime Minister would be wise to back the Chancellor and the Business Secretary in a new dash for gas.More from NewsAdele wears diamond ring at the Brit Awards sparking speculation she\u0026#39s engaged to Rich PaulSNP ‘rewriting history’ by denying plan to chop classroom doors to stop CovidNHS waiting lists will soar no matter what, warns Sajid JavidTackling massive NHS waiting lists is a mission with social justice at its very heartGuto Harri must declare any recent contact with Huawei, says ex-MI6 chiefSir John Major set to accuse Boris Johnson of harming trust in politics over ‘partygate’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"duchess cambridge opens motherhood visit parental support project","story":"The Duchess of Cambridge made fruit kebabs and accepted pretend cups of tea from toddlers, as she spoke of the vital importance of play to building healthy children.The Duchess, who spent time with mothers and toddlers at PACT (Parents and Communities Together) in Southwark today, said she wished she had been able to attend a similar group when she was expecting her first child, admitting she would have “learned a lot”.Helping young children chop and eat fruit to the soundtrack of a catchy song about bananas, she spoke to parents about the importance of a “holistic” system to ensure isolated new mothers and their babies do not “fall through the cracks”.Hearing how PACT runs “Parent University” courses for expectant parents and those with newborn babies, the Duchess heard how mothers were learning about social and emotional development as well as the basics about labour and feeding.“Do you feel there’s enough awareness and understanding around social and emotional development among under 5s?” she asked Josephine Namusisi-Riley, who leads PACT in Southwark.“There’s perhaps more about what they’re eating and what parents are doing about physical milestones?”Josephine and health visitor Simonette Guerra described how the course dealt with the importance of the early years, including brain and language development and play.“As a new mum I would have liked that,” said the Duchess. I think I would have learned a lot.“The importance of play!“What’s so fantastic is seeing the amazing work that’s going on here. That support you’re providing is amazing. The science backs it up.”The Duchess has made a lifelong commitment to working in Early Years Development, reading academic literature that underlines the importance of play as well as closely following new research.Hearing how some new parents worry about their children being “naughty” despite them behaving in a developmentally-appropriate way for toddlers, she agreed: “Behaviour is communication.“Throwing things is all about learning.”She arrived at St Michael’s Church in Camberwell on Tuesday morning, walking around the corner for a low-key greeting while the usual royal police escort parked discreetly out of sight.The mothers taking part in the weekly play session had not been told of their VIP guest until they arrived at the session with their babies that morning.The Duchess was greeted by Josephine Namusisi-Riley, who leads PACT in Southwark, and Mena Amnour, parent organiser of MumSpace, who told her about the group.PACT was set up by Citizens UK in 2014, after local mothers signalled the need for a real-life group to make new friends and receive support.In the pandemic, it provided emergency help to isolated families from giving out laptops to help those who were homeschooling to food parcels, training in how to order prescriptions online, and a regular Zoom meeting for parents to socialise.Josephine told the Duchess they had noticed the particular difficulties of “digital exclusion”, where families with multiple children were trying to work and home school with one laptop between them, did not have Wi Fi connections, and did not speak good enough English to find help.She also told of the numerous barriers local parents faced in reaching support, including stigma, fear of approaching official services or even registering with a GP.“Has the conversation changed since the pandemic?” the Duchess asked, guessing: “It’s exacerbated everything.”“Feeling connected to each other as humans and being able to listen to each other helps with the isolation.“Where families go to find a holistic support system.“So much we say is mental health is having someone to talk to and listen.”She added: “For the child’s journey, being able to link up health with then education, through the community programmes and services like this, is really vital.”Hearing about the baby bank of clothes for struggling families, the Duchess asked: “For the parents and families who come here, are their needs related to food and clothing for the children, as opposed to emotional needs?”She heard how parents usually came with a physical need, before being welcomed with a hug, a cup of tea and a listening ear.The Duchess was invited to join a small group of toddlers and their carers, who were making fruit kebabs for fun and a lesson in healthy eating.The Duchess helped one little boy, Jonathan - who was wearing a smart shirt as he celebrated his second birthday - chop up his banana.His grandmother Grace told her that the sessions were “a lot of children and many, many toys - it’s find to be here”.“Has it helped your relationship with him?” the Duchess asked, breaking off to say “Good job!” to the little boy who was eating nicely.Going to shake the hand of another mother, she laughed “Sorry, now I’ve got a sticky hand” before pulling a face of amazement at one-year-old Zoe who was busy eating strawberries.“I can see why everyone likes it here,” the Duchess said.Later, she joined the main room where new mothers were socialising as they fed their newborns, while volunteers played with older babies and toddlers so their parents had a moment to talk.The Duchess watched children climbing up a frame to go down a slide, and accepted a make-believe ‘cup of tea’, actually full of kinetic sand, from a little boy called George - the same name as her own eldest son.Playing along, she took her mask off for a pretend sip before saying thank you and passing it back to him.The Duchess spent time with Laura Barber, mother of two-year-old Rebecca, who talked about mental health and the challenges of parenting in isolation.“She said if she had had something like this, she would have appreciated it too,” Ms Barber added.Before leaving, the Duchess told staff and volunteers, many of whom arrived at the group as new mothers themselves: “Thank you for your hard work, it’s really impressive. It’s such good fun, I want to go back in there!”Of her work in early childhood development, and making generational change for the children of the future, she added: “It’s going to take a long time, joining the dots. It’s not a quick thing.”Early evidence from a study by King’s College in 2020 suggested that the model used by PACT improves parental mental wellbeing, reduces social isolation, and improves child language outcomes.They found that 40 per cent of the mothers who came to the Mumspace group were at the threshold of getting some form of mental health intervention, with 68 per cent of those assessed as fully recovering within six months.More from NewsAdele wears diamond ring at the Brit Awards sparking speculation she\u0026#39s engaged to Rich PaulSNP ‘rewriting history’ by denying plan to chop classroom doors to stop CovidNHS waiting lists will soar no matter what, warns Sajid JavidTackling massive NHS waiting lists is a mission with social justice at its very heartGuto Harri must declare any recent contact with Huawei, says ex-MI6 chiefSir John Major set to accuse Boris Johnson of harming trust in politics over ‘partygate’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"justin welby asks difficult remove slavery linked cambridge","story":"A Cambridge college memorial to a donor linked to slavery should be removed, the Archbishop of Canterbury has suggested, as the Church was criticised for its lack of ersity.The Most Rev Justin Welby waded into the debate surrounding the plaque of Tobias Rustat for the first time, asking: “Why is it so much agony to remove a memorial to slavery?”His comments before the General Synod on Tuesday come amid an ongoing court battle over the memorial to the 17th-century royal courtier at Jesus College, Cambridge. The controversy surrounds Tobias Rustat’s role as an investor in companies linked to the slave trade.Earlier at the meeting, Archbishop Welby also commented on the harassment of Sir Keir Starmer by a mob who linked the Labour leader to the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile.He described it as a sign of a society that is “forgetting God”, in the latest intervention by the Archbishop which could be seen as critical of Boris Johnson. The Prime Minister has refused to apologise for claiming in the Commons that Sir Keir failed to prosecute the notorious paedophile.The meeting of the Church of England’s legislative body was also addressed by Lord Boateng, the head of the Archbishops’ Racial Justice Commission and Britain’s first black government minister.He told the chamber that the church was too white and said that the “government frontbench looks better” in terms of ersity.Lord Boateng said: “Imagine what it is to go into a place of worship to look up and to see a monument to someone who was a party to the enslavement of your ancestors.“We are in part members and worshippers in churches who have themselves benefited from the horrors of slavery.”Lord Boateng, 70, a former Labour MP who was made parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department of Health in 1997, is responsible for leading a three-year review into how to tackle racism within the church.The Archbishop welcomed his comments and said: “We need to change our practices.“Why is it so difficult to do that? Why do they have to go through hearing how it ‘doesn’t really matter’ or it is ‘not strictly accurate’ and so on, but all they want to do is put it somewhere safer where they can comment on it, not to blow it up.”According to a court hearing regarding the future of the Rustat memorial, it causes “pain and discomfort” to the Master of Jesus College, Sonita Alleyne, who is a black woman.More from NewsAdele wears diamond ring at the Brit Awards sparking speculation she\u0026#39s engaged to Rich PaulSNP ‘rewriting history’ by denying plan to chop classroom doors to stop CovidNHS waiting lists will soar no matter what, warns Sajid JavidTackling massive NHS waiting lists is a mission with social justice at its very heartGuto Harri must declare any recent contact with Huawei, says ex-MI6 chiefSir John Major set to accuse Boris Johnson of harming trust in politics over ‘partygate’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must end reliance chinese cctv cameras","story":"How would it feel to know that when you are walking down the street you are being watched by the same cameras that support the Chinese surveillance state? For many in Britain, this is not hypothetical. Hundreds of thousands of cameras made by Hikvision and Dahua, whose equipment have been linked to the persecution of Uyghur Muslims, make up the backbone of Britain’s CCTV infrastructure.Last year the US government blacklisted the two companies over national security concerns, but here in Britain the Government failed to heed calls from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee to follow suit. The dominance of Hikvision and Dahua in Britain puts the country’s security, privacy and moral standing in the world at risk.Big Brother Watch has found that thousands of public bodies, and some of the UK’s biggest businesses, use these CCP-linked cameras. Three quarters of local councils are equipped with Hikvision or Dahua cameras, as are more than half of schools and universities and a handful of government departments.Although doing nothing illegal, both companies offer much more than video recording. In Xinjiang, they have developed technology that was once the stuff of a science fiction nightmare and tailored it to the all-encompassing mass surveillance state – from facial recognition on every street corner to cameras sending “Uyghur alerts” to the authorities.Similar tools are on offer in Britain. Some schools have CCTV capable of face or gender detection and the coronavirus pandemic has led to a spike in temperature-scanning camera sales. One school in Yorkshire has much more advanced Hikvision technology, capable of searching CCTV footage by clothing colour, tracking people and even using AI to detect schoolyard scraps or if children are wearing face masks.We are already one of the most heavily monitored populations on the planet. Now, low-cost CCTV cameras are stationed across the country, with Hikvision and Dahua’s pile ‘em high, sell ‘em cheap business models fuelling a boom in high tech surveillance cameras on the side of every other building. For little more than £100, it is possible to buy a camera powered by algorithms that claim to analyse our behaviour, vehicles, and much more.People should be free to go about their daily lives without being watched by such cameras. Britain must push back on the creeping growth of Chinese-style surveillance and do more to protect against backsliding into a world where privacy is a mere afterthought.More from NewsAdele wears diamond ring at the Brit Awards sparking speculation she\u0026#39s engaged to Rich PaulSNP ‘rewriting history’ by denying plan to chop classroom doors to stop CovidNHS waiting lists will soar no matter what, warns Sajid JavidTackling massive NHS waiting lists is a mission with social justice at its very heartGuto Harri must declare any recent contact with Huawei, says ex-MI6 chiefSir John Major set to accuse Boris Johnson of harming trust in politics over ‘partygate’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pigeon racing dying among working class says veteran breeder","story":"It was once one of the most popular sports in Britain, beloved in particular by miners who took part during their days off work.Today though, pigeon-racing has fallen back to earth. Membership of Royal Pigeon Racing Association, which reached 60,000 at the end of the 1980s, has tumbled to 20,000 and continues to decrease year on year.On the other side of the world, however, the sport has taken wing. China, like the UK, has a long history of pigeon breeding - and racing has become more popular. A recent estimate put the number of Beijing-based pigeon-keepers at 100,000.Whereas in Britain racing pigeons have been known as “the poor man’s racehorse”, the opposite is true in China. In November 2020 New Kim, a two-year-old Belgian racing pigeon, was bought by a bidder from China for €1.6 million (£1.4 million).Such enormous fees, more comparable to the price of a Premier League footballer than a pet, are not common enough to affect the British pigeon market, said John Angwin, a breeder from Cornwall. A top-class pigeon will rarely cost more than £150 or £200, and pigeon club members will often give birds to beginners free of charge.The problem, said Mr Angwin, a 53-year-old Cornishman, is the prospect of Brexit red tape. Before Britain left the European Union, pigeon fanciers faced few obstacles when bringing their birds onto the Continent for races. Now they have to pay for veterinary injections and for the birds to be quarantined. The majority of fanciers, Mr Angwin said, “are all retired or working-class people, and they haven’t got that disposable income to be able to afford to pay for the vets”.This adds to the problems faced by the sport. “It used to be a really big and competitive sport, but it is dying now, because of the older generation, and there’s no new generation coming in.”The Royal Pigeon Racing Association, whose patron is the Queen, is advising Defra in its negotiations with the European Union over a deal that fanciers hope will make Continental pigeon transport relatively cheap. “We hope that in the next few weeks there will be an announcement,” said Ian Evans, of the association.The birds are likely to require vaccinations against avian disease, but vets will be able to certify them by the convoy instead of inidually. “A convoy of pigeons can be anything up to 10,000 birds transported at the same point at the same time to a race. When you ide that £500” – a possible veterinary fee – “by 10,000 birds, it’s negligible, isn’t it?”There is no consensus on the cause of the decline of British pigeon racing. Mr Angwin cited modern entertainment: “Youngsters don\u0027t want to come into the sport now because they\u0027re more into tech equipment rather than riding on their bikes and playing in the streets like we used to do.”Mr Evans, meanwhile, theorised that it might have something to do with the decline of working men’s clubs. “People used to see the pigeon sport, or know the pigeon sport, simply by going to the local women\u0027s clubs. But now, you know, if you don\u0027t go to those areas, you don\u0027t know the sport exists.”He was bullish on the sport’s future, saying that the decline in membership was levelling off. “There are new people coming into the sport: men, women, children, of all, you know, all different backgrounds.”Over the past few years, the association has started reaching out to schools. “We\u0027ve got six schools around the country now with pigeon lofts, Mr Evans said. The children look after the pigeons and race them competitively in local clubs, and have been rather successful. The pigeon project, as it’s called in each school, is then built into the curriculum, because pigeon racing can lend itself to lots of different things in terms of history, mathematics – which is used to calculate the result of a race – and geography.”The media attention on Chinese mega-purchases is helpful, said Mr Evans, because “it’s brought the sport to the public eye, which is something we’ve been struggling with”. Overall, Chinese interest in the sport has made “little impact” in Britain, “unless you were one of the lucky people who’s been able to sell some of their pigeons for large sums.”The decline, then, might not be terminal. “We can address it and ensure that traditional pigeon racing survives into the future,” said Mr Evans.More from NewsAdele wears diamond ring at the Brit Awards sparking speculation she\u0026#39s engaged to Rich PaulSNP ‘rewriting history’ by denying plan to chop classroom doors to stop CovidNHS waiting lists will soar no matter what, warns Sajid JavidTackling massive NHS waiting lists is a mission with social justice at its very heartGuto Harri must declare any recent contact with Huawei, says ex-MI6 chiefSir John Major set to accuse Boris Johnson of harming trust in politics over ‘partygate’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"give bumper defence deals british","story":"Exclusive: Give bumper defence deals to British workers - and dont just focus on priceThe Prospect union wants ministers to take more account of benefits to society rather than chasing the cheapest contractsCampaigners hope a contract for three Fleet Solid Support ships will go to a UK-led consortiumByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsMinisters have been accused of ignoring their own rules when awarding bumper defence deals. The Prospect union says the Government is failing to properly apply the “social value test”, which assesses benefits to communities when handing out lucrative contracts. The union believes the Tories have been too focused on the costs of projects and not taken enough account of the potential impact on workers and wider society.Prospect pointed to the  Ministry of Defence announcement that the UK would equip its new Apache helicopters with missiles made by US firm Lockheed Martin - despite a bid from Stevenage-based MBDA, which employs , staff. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter Prospect has produced a -page report, ‘Social value and the prosperity agenda in defence’, seen exclusively by the Mirror, calling for the social value test to be bolstered to give more weight to non-price considerations and measuring tenders against “key performance indicators” such as jobs, skills and local investment.  Senior deputy general secretary Sue Ferns said: “A more rounded approach would enable the Government to use defence spending strategically to help drive its levelling-up agenda while supporting skills, and reinforcing the UK’s sovereign defence capabilities from design to build.” The union fears a £.billion deal for three naval supply ships could go to a foreign-led bid. The Government has “made clear that a substantial part of the build” for the Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will “be conducted in the UK” and “there is a requirement to integrate all ships in a UK shipyard”. But that has sparked fears a UK-led consortium could miss out, with much of the work taking place overseas. Ms Ferns added: “The MoD is responsible for around £bn of annual contract expenditure which,directed properly, can have the dual effect of supporting British business and driving the levelling-up agenda.  “To date this potential benefit has not been delivered as well as it ought to be and the Government is failing in its mission to increase the contribution to UK prosperity from defence. The main reason is that headline price is still the primary driver of procurement decisions rather than a holistic assessment that considers the impact on local communities, the economy and climate change alongside headline price.” Shadow Defence Minister Chris Evans said: “The MoD’s procurement system is failing British businesses. “From wasting billions of pounds in cancelled contracts to the social value test not being applied properly, ministers are repeatedly missing opportunities to provide and support local jobs across the country.“Our defence and aerospace industries are national assets and Labour is committed to a ‘British-built by default’ approach to defence procurement which would support the growth of the British defence sector and build resilience in our supply chains.”A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman: “Social Value Tests are undertaken as required in our procurement and any suggestion otherwise is completely incorrect. “These tests are one of many important factors in our procurement as we seek to ensure value for taxpayers’ money, benefit to the UK and securing the best equipment for our Armed Forces.“Defence proudly supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across every corner of the country and in the last year spent over £ billion with UK industry.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lockheed Martin CorporationMinistry of DefencePublic servicesThe economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Suzanne Webb, a minister for Trade, Women and Equalities boasted just look at our record insisting the Government will continue to be the Government of low taxes. Ms Webb claimed removing the VAT on fuel and energy bills would disproportionately benefit wealthier households. But MPs laughed and jeered as she claimed the Tories were solving the crisis. The Resolution Foundation says the measures will leave the average household £ a year worse off, or .% of their disposable income, in  .  And energy bill also rising in April could bring gas and electricity fees to % of the entire budget for Britain’s poorest households - up from .% last year.During the opposition day debate, Labour MPs shared heartbreaking stories of their constituents having to rely on food banks in the st century and families expressing their fears of rising energy bills.Only  Tory MPs showed up to the debate on the cost of living crisis and food insecurity, as the PM reshuffled his team in a bid to shake-up Downing Streetaposs apospartyapos culture. Labouraposs Carolyn Harris shared a heartbreaking message she received from one of her constituents in Swansea East who had been unable to allow their kids to taste brussel sprouts because of food insecurity left unsolved by the Tories. Ian Lavery also shared a message from a single parent in his Wansbeck constituency. The constituency told him: Itaposs dficult to imagine without experiencing it. How tiring being skint is. How youaposre so utterly consumed by financial hardship that it consumes every decision you make on a daily basis. It takes up every thought you make, you canapost escape. No wonder thereaposs a mental health crisis. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron urged the Government to cut VAT on fuel and energy bills in order to solve the crisis.The only useful thing one could do having left the European Union, the one silver lining and they won’t deploy it, so why not cut VAT on fuel bills and give people that relief that they desperately need, Mr Farron told MPs.There’s too little being done to help those whose need is the greatest.”  But Ms Webb accused opposition MPs of playing the blame game rather than offering solutions to support families and over and actually overlooking what is actually really happening. I am acutely aware of the challenges my constituents are currently facing. With cost of living and rice on food and energy bills. This is an international issue that countries everywhere are facing. Iaposm surprised that the opposition decry the government presiding over falling wages and the lack of job opportunities. Why is it not this conservative government that introduced the national living wage in  , before adding Iaposm surprised that the motion limits the government supposethis government will continue to be the government of low taxes. MPs jeered and laughed in unison but she pressed on. I am pleased that this government is being honest with people by proposing practical policies to support families with rising energy prices, Ms Webb added. Hours before the opposition day debate took place, experts warned people will struggle to eat and heat their homes as they pay around £million worth of lost consumer cash from collapsed energy companies. Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at the National Energy Action charity told the Business, Energy and Industry Committee that Brits on the lowest incomes will be the hardest hit by the tax hikes from April, as they reside in the least-fuel efficient homes. Mr Smith also warned: “People used to talk about the choice between heating or eating. It’s getting to a situation where people won’t be able to do either satisfactorily.  He expects . million households will not be able to keep their homes warm despite the Government’s latest proposals. Energy bills are set to increase by % from April for millions of households across the country. It could equate to a rise of £ per year for the average household. Jim McMahon Shadow Environment and Food Secretary accused the Government of actively making matters worse as Brits are struggling to afford food in the cost of living crisis. Ms Harris told MPs a family in her constituency thanked her for running a campaign that allowed them to celebrate Christmas. “They usually rely on food banks and whilst they are extremely grateful to the food banks, they said it felt amazing not to feel like it’s charity stuff with black marks on the tins.They felt overwhelmed they had been able to give their children a proper Christmas dinner without tinned potatoes. Their two-year-old child had never tasted a fresh potato, let alone a brussel sprouts or a parsnip.”Shadow Environment and Food Secretary Jim McMahon blasted the Tories for making the crisis actively worse - their lack of inaction forcing people to rely on food banks. Tory MP for Peterborough Paul Bristow shouted thataposs what food banks do in the chamber. Despite this, Mr McMahon added: Food banks rely on the charity of our neighbours. Thataposs a reality. How are we going to tackle the cost of living crisis when our neighbours are struggling to secure food too  In the same debate, Tory MP Lee Anderson was accused of intimidation for calling Labouraposs Mr Lavery a coward. Mr Anderson insulted Mr Lavery after his repeated requests to intervene during the opposition day debate.At the start of the day, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned MPs their words have consequences after Labour leader Keir Starmer was hounded by a mob near Parliament.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBoris JohnsonEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors.

Ms Owatemi said: “The appalling entrenched inequality that leaves Black women at a much higher risk of pregnancy loss is a damning indictment of the Conservative government. “For over a decade, ministers have failed to prioritise Black women’s health and failed to tackle the deep-seated structural inequalities in healthcare that are putting them at risk.“While Labour has called for a national strategy to tackle health inequalities, with ministerial accountability and targets, the Conservatives have delayed a women’s health strategy for England and denied structural racial inequality even exists.“The next Labour Government will treat Black, Asian and minority ethnic women with respect by bringing in a Race Equality Act to tackle structural racial inequality at source.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyPregnancyGiving birthMental healthMiscarriagePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There can be no doubt that MPs of all stripes are well aware of the realities of the cost of living crisis we face.That’s why the Labour Party tabled a motion in the Commons, putting forward suggestions on how to tackle an inflation crisis of the Conservatives’ own making. We urged the government to set out a national strategy for food, including how it intends to ensure access to high quality, sustainable, affordable food for all and meet the United Nations goal to end hunger by .Yet not a single Cabinet minister bothered to turn up until the th hour – too busy shuffling the deckchairs on the prime minister’s doomed vessel, as he scrabbles to save his job.  Those who are responsible are failing to do anything about the spiralling cost of your weekly shop, brought about in no small part by their failure to make Brexit work and properly support British suppliers and producers. It’s becoming something of a pattern for this government. No accountability and no grip on reality. Far too many of us know all too well the consequences of not being able to afford to live. As I told the House, the darkness of poverty isn’t just not being able to turn the lights on. It’s being driven into debt and despair, keeping your curtains are closed even in the day-time - because you’re fearful of the debt collector knocking on the door. Labour has set out a plan to cut the cost of energy bills, saving the poorest households about £. The time for this government to refocus its efforts is long overdue. Labour’s contract of security, prosperity and respect with the British people will end the cycle of high tax and low growth that has mired working families in perpetual instability for the last decade. We have set out a fully costed plan to keep bills low and support British business to bolster sustainability and affordability of good quality food. The Tories now stand on their record. They’re all out of ideas, their leader has run out of road and the British people have run out of patience.

Heres everything you need to knowThe DVSA has proposed six changes to driving tests Image: Getty Images iStockphotoBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsPreparing for driving tests can be daunting, with Highway Code revision to cram into your brain and hopes of a smooth run when out for the test itself. After a range of new Highway Code changes were enforced on January , , it seems budding drivers will have to brush up on their knowledge of the rules. And, with the pandemic causing chaos for driving test and theory test bookings, it seems there could be more trouble ahead for those looking to pass their test and get behind the wheel. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency DVSAhas proposed a range of changes to driving tests due to demand being at the highest it has aposever knownapos. Due to the scarcity of test slots, it has caused many learner drivers to book in tests far earlier than they are ready for.So, here are all of the DVSAaposs proposed changes for driving tests that could be enforced in just months. What are the DVSAaposs six proposals for driving test changes in   . Ensuring learner drivers are prepared for their driving test  Perhaps the most crucial element for budding drivers is that being prepared for your upcoming driving test is more vital than ever. The proposal suggests extending the amount of time you will need to wait before rebooking a car driving test, after failing one, to  days — you currently need to wait just  days.This move is also being pushed to allow for more training time to prevent retakes from being done with no further training. The DVSA states that, due to long waiting lists for lessons, slotting in time for extra training is tricky for driving instructors.With the proposed -day extension, there is a greater window of opportunity for learner drivers to take top-up lessons so they are better prepared for the car driving test.  This change would apply solely to car driving tests. The following would not be affected by this:other types of driving tests, such as motorcycle tests, heavy goods vehicleand bus driving tests theory tests approved driving instructortests. Forcing learners to give more notice for car driving test cancellations Finding time for a driving test booking can be tricky due to shortages of slots, and all sorts of surprises can crop up in day-to-day le leading to test cancellations. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that , driving tests were cancelled between April , , and December , , alone. The new proposal suggests forcing learner drivers to give  days of notice when cancelling their car driving test to avoid losing their fee. They currently only need to give three days of notice when cancelling a car driving test.  This would not be enforced for reasons like bereavement, illness and other circumstances decided by the DVSA. The change would allow for fewer driving test slots being wasted, and therefore it could potentially lead to a higher volume of tests being available to book. When the fee loss policy was temporarily lted during the pandemic, the DVSA found that there was an increase in tests being cancelled at the last minute. This reduced signicantly upon the fee loss police being reintroduced for short notice period cancellations. . Identying data surrounding how well driving instructors prepare learner drivers  The DVSA has proposed a method to easily identy which driving instructors need the most help and support with providing high-quality training. It suggests introducing a legal requirement for them to display their approved driving instructoror trainee driving instructor registration certicate in the windscreen of their car when brining people to driving tests. The DVSA explained the reasoning behind this, and said it would:encourage driving instructors to only bring people for their driving testthey’re confident they will pass help us improve our ability to identy and prioritise which driving instructors most need help and support to provide high-quality training mean that we can treat all driving instructors bringing pupils for tests consistentlyCurrently, driving instructors are only legally required to do this when carrying out driving lessons, but not for driving tests. However, many do so voluntarily.  If enforced, DVSA driving examiners would record the instructoraposs personal reference number and the test results can then be linked back to them. This would then allow the DVSA to identythe driving instructor needed a standards check. The proposal could mean that driving instructors who refuse to display the certicate could lose the approval to teach. It would also help the DVSA to identy and remove instructors from the register who are not offering high-quality training. . Offer more information about driving instructors to learners  While learner drivers can currently see the name, phone number, email address and distance of the driving instructor, the DVSA is pushing for more transparency. The proposed changes are displaying the following information deduced from a rolling -month period:average number of driving faults their pupils make per test average number of serious faults their pupils make per test percentage of the driving instructors’ pupils tests where the driving examiner had to take physical action in the interests of public safety overall pass rate for the driving instructors’ pupils. Changes to learner driver eyesight checks during driving tests  The DVSA has suggested a change in the law surrounding driver eyesight checks during driving tests, with the ability to do eyesight checks in dferent levels of light and use ious methods to test eyesight. At present, the law only allows for eyesight checks in good daylight and the test involves reading a registration plate on a parked vehicle up to  metres away. The changes would apply to car, motorcycle, tractor, specialist vehicle and approved driving instructorand part driving tests.  The move would allow for more flexibility for driving test times offered, and to ensure drivers meet eyesight standards under a range of conditions. Additionally, it would prevent test cancellations when there is poor light. . Swapping paper pass certicates for digital pass certicates The DVSA has proposed paper pass certicates for driving and theory tests should be swapped for digital versions. If passed, this will apply to all driving tests and would be in-line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyefforts to create a digital driving licence.  The move would not only prevent people from losing physical copies, but it is also likely to help the environment with a lack of need for over two million sheets of paper printed annually. Why are the driving test changes being proposed by the DVSA and when would they be enforced  The DVSA has proposed these six driving test changes due to a a range of factors, but it is predominantly due to a vast increase in demand for driving tests. The website states additional reasoning for the change proposals, with the hopes that they will:encourage learner drivers to be better prepared for their driving test help to reduce the number of driving test appointments that are wasted give us more flexibility in how and when we can carry out driving testsWhen will the DVSA driving test changes be decided and how can I have my say The DVSA encourages people across the UK to have their say about the driving test changes on its website.The consultation vegan on January , , and will close at .pm on March , . Following the responses, the next steps will be decided and published within three months of the consultation closing, so by June , .

Kate joined families at the activity and wellbeing session run by PACTat MumSpace in Southwark today. Kate, a champion of research into early childhood, heard about the challenges faced as she joined in with a cooking workshop during the visit. She helped young children chop and eat fruit to the soundtrack of a catchy song about bananas.Have your say on the latest royal developments in the comment section She spoke to parents about the importance of a “holistic” system to ensure isolated new mothers and their babies do not “fall through the cracks”. Hearing how PACT runs “Parent University” courses for expectant parents and those with newborn babies, the duchess heard how mothers were learning about social and emotional development as well as the basics about labour and feeding. Josephine Namusisi-Riley, who leads PACT in Southwark, and health visitor Simonette Guerra described how the course dealt with the importance of the early years, including brain and language development and play. “As a new mum I would have liked that,” the Duchess said. “I think I would have learned a lot. The importance of play.”  She added: “What’s so fantastic is seeing the amazing work that’s going on here. That support you’re providing is amazing. The science backs it up.” Kate helped two-year-old Jonathan – who was wearing a smart shirt and celebrating his birthday – chop up his banana. His grandmother Grace told her that the sessions featured “a lot of children and many, many toys”. “Has it helped your relationship with him ” Kate asked, breaking off to say “Good job” to the youngster who was eating nicely.  Going to shake the hand of one mother, she laughed: “Sorry, now I’ve got a sticky hand,” before pulling a face of amazement at Zoe, a nearby one-year-old, who was busy eating strawberries. “I can see why everyone likes it here,” Kate added. Kate watched children climbing up a frame to go down a slide, and accepted a ‘cup of tea’, full of kinetic sand, from a boy called George – the same name as her eldest. Playing along, she took her mask off for a pretend sip before saying thank you and passing it back to him.The duchess spent time with Laura Barber, mother of two-year-old Rebecca, who talked about mental health and the challenges of parenting in isolation. Ms Barber said: “She saidshe had had something like this, she would have appreciated it too.” MumSpace playgroups are free weekly sessions organised by PACT to allow mothers to share the ups and downs of motherhood. Kate, has set up the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, is said to focus much of her charity work on early childhood and how it affects outcomes in later le.  Kate will also meet a health visitor who regularly provides the group with advice and signposting to other services, before joining a cooking workshop with parents and children. Through her work over the past decade The Duchess of Cambridge is understood to have seen first-hand how some of today’s hardest social challenges have their roots in the earliest years of a person’s le. The Duchess says she is committed to raising awareness of the importance of early childhood experiences and of collaborative action to improve outcomes across society.

Jack McDonough watched keenly when workers from Cadent Gas and BCH Civils were working outside his house in the Childwall area of Liverpool. Having brought out cups of tea and chatting to engineers Simon, Dave, Ian, Andy and James while he was on his way to and from nursery, the three-year old was rewarded with his own hard hat, high vis jacket and his first ever pay packet.Jackaposs mum Steph told Liverpool Echo : He just loves anything and everything to do with construction so, on the way to and from nursery every day, he went to say hello to them and they would say hello back.He was just in heaven and the fact that they were so kind to him - we stood on our wall and just watched them dig for about an hour - they were just talking to him every day. They would involve him and talk to him - they were just really kind, asking him about his day at nursery. We gave him some cups of tea and biscuits to take out when they were working outside ours because they were so kind to him.Jackaposs involvement and interest in their work paid idends. Steph added: One day as we were walking down to nursery, one of the engineers said that he would come and knock on later because they had a gt for him. It was a little hard hat, a gt bag, a little high vis jacket and a wage packet with £ in for him to say thank you for being so helpful. It was just lovely - it absolutely made his day. They had been so kind to him the whole time but that was above and beyond. Compensated for his labour and with his interest in construction bolstered further, Jack still keeps an eye out for his colleagues, who Steph said left a lasting impact on him. She added: Now whenever he sees anyone in an outfit that’s sort of similar, he’ll say ‘there’s my friends’. Though he has not yet started primary school, Steph says Jackaposs heart is set on a career in engineering. She added: Whenever we take him out and there are roadworks, he makes us drive the way of the roadworks so that he can watch them. He absolutely loves it. Our house is full of construction-related toys. He’s got a ride-on excavator that he goes out and ‘digs’ with, so to have them outside our house was amazing.Jenny Moten, North West Network Director, Cadent, said: “This all went a bit under the radar - the team didn’t go looking for any praise, they just wanted to make Jack’s day. So it was lovely to hear Jack’s parents speak so highly of them. Let’s hope we can maintain Jack’s interest and have him a fully-fledged member of the team in years to come.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HousingPeople\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A court heard they went for a countryside walkies in the village of Llanymynech, Powys, when they decided to go back to Dean’s home. Victim Miss Durie was alone in the room with the dog - when Freddie “pinned” his paws on her shoulders.  Magistrates heard Dean had been out of the room making a drink when his pooch sunk his teeth into Ms Durie’s hand and forearm. Miss Durie told the court the dog had been acting aggressively throughout the afternoon in September .

The young boy suffered fractures and was saved thanks to two blood transfusionsCharlie Golden pictured in hospital after the car collisionByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsThe family of an -year-old who miraculously survived a horror car collision have told how heroic blood donors saved his le. Charlie Golden was crossing the road outside his home when the massive blow to his head removed his scalp and fractured his pelvis in four places. Medics had to physically hold his head for five hours because they couldn’t stop the bleeding until two transfusions eventually saw him pull through. Trauma incidents happen every day in Britain and many patients will only survivethere is quick access to enough blood. Around a third of blood donated goes to patients undergoing emergency surgery. Mum Lauren explained Charlie, then aged eight, was leaving their house in Aylesham, Canterbury, and was about to show friends a shortcut to their local park. “His dad Paul called out to Charlie to be careful on the road, like he always did, and watched them cross from the bay window,” she told the Mirror.  “That’s when he saw the car hit our boy, right outside the front door. He just shouted ‘he’s been hit’ and ran out of the door. “Paul and a neighbour basically held his head together and started to stem the bleeding.” Charlie’s scalp had been “degloved” and the injury was so severe that he was put into a coma on the roadside before being airlted to Kings College Hospital in London. Charlie was in critical condition for  hours while two blood motorbikes arrived bringing extra blood to the hospital to keep him alive. Lauren said: “He would have diedthere had not been enough blood available in the area at that time. “I remember lying next to Charlie in his hospital bed and really wishing that I had donated.“A few days after the accident, I put an appeal out on Facebook to all my family and friends pleading with them to donate blood as I knew that the generosity of others had just saved my little boy’s le. “Blood is one of those things you just expect to be there when you need it, but I hadn’t stopped to consider where it comes from.” The NHS is , regular blood donors short of what it needs to recover from the Covid- pandemic. With stocks in England now supplied by the smallest pool of donors ever in the st century the Mirror is campaigning for readers to register to help make up the shortfall. Around three quarters of a million selfless donors kept hospitals in stock at the height of the Covid- crisis but this was , fewer regular donors than the year before. Charlie survived but lives with an acquired brain injury that means he has some learning dficulties. Lauren and husband Paul now regularly give blood. Lauren said: “The other day, I received a text message telling me which hospital my blood has been issued to. “All I could think of were those amazing people who received that same text when their donation saved my Charlie’s le. “A lot of people played a huge part in Charlie surviving this terrible accident. Without someone somewhere donating the blood that Charlie was given, he would have died.” How you can help Register as a blood donor today and play your part in the NHS recovery. Patients need blood all year around and the NHS needs to ensure a steady supply. In some areas of the country there are limited appointments for first time donors soyou cannot find a slot straight away please search a few weeks or months ahead.

Council worker Paula Allen had gone out looking for Marcus Simmons-Allen, , after being alerted about the impact near their family home. But she ended up being first on the accident scene and cradled the youngster in her arms as he lay fatally injured. Moments earlier Marcus, who was due to start his first day of college, had been run down at mph and left to die by Connor Matthews, , who was driving a stolen car. Despite the teenaposs mum and dadaposs efforts to revive him, Marcus succumbed to his injuries in hospital the following morning.At Manchester Crown Court, Mrs Allen who is in her s fought back tears as Matthews, from Stretford, was jailed for six years and eight months. The court heard how the motorist had no driving licence and had previously been issued with as ASBO. Mrs Allen said in a statement: aposFinding my son that night, like a bag of rubbish fly tipped at the side of the road, haunts me. aposaposI was the first person at Marcusaposs side, holding him, trying to find his pulse. His leless body, my son dying in my arms. Time stood still. My precious son was going, fading. I found myself running into the road, stopping the traffic and screaming, pleading for anyone to help, for anyone to save him. aposaposI knew he was in a bad way, really bad. As mothers we are there to love, mend, fix, provide and advise. I was now helpless trying to save my sons le.  Emergency services and strangers were fighting to keep Marcus alive. As the short hours passed, we had to accept that Marcus could not and would not ever survive. The tragedy occurred on October  last year after Marcus had popped out to buy a pint of milk with his friend Connor Kelly. Both checked for oncoming cars as they were about to cross a dual carriageway but as they set off, Matthews who was on his way to a party suddenly appeared in a VW Scirocco driving at high speed. Marcus attempted to jog across the road in an attempt to get to the other side but had barely got two paces when he was hit by the vehicle. Prosecutor David Lees said: aposaposHe was hit by the car and flung through the air landing some distance away. Matthews then slowed before driving off again.  Connor Kelly called out to a pedestrian to call the police then decided to run back to Marcusapos house to tell Ms Allen. He then ran back to the scene and stayed with his friend until the paramedics arrived. aposMs Allen recalled how she had just got into her car when she saw Connor in a state of panic, the court heard. He shouted aposcome quick, come quick it was Marcusapos and she drive off looking for her son, it was said. Mr Lees continued: aposaposShe could not see anything initially so turned the car around. It was then that she could see something that she initially thought was a bag of fly tipped rubbish on the road. To her horror she then realised that it was her son.aposapos  In her statement read to the court Mrs Allen told how she pulled up just before where Marcus was laying and put on her hazard lights. I think I shouted at Connor who had gone to the floor in horror upon arriving on foot to where Marcus lay, she said. aposaposHe was lying face down on the pavement approximately . metres from the lamp posts down from the crossing area where Marcus got hit by the car. I screamed at Connor to ring an ambulance and the police. The mum checked Marcusaposs body to seehe was responsive and noticed a gaping wound on his right eyebrow and his right eye was swollen, she said. She discovered a pulse and reassured her son including in the ambulance.  Marcus was described by his family as aposaposvery loving and joyousaposapos person who had been working towards his degree in engineering. aposUnfortunately the day he sadly passed away was supposed to be his first day at college, his mum added. His death has ripped our family apart. My son left the house to walk with his friend and never ed home. aposaposThe point of physical impact that caused Marcusaposs death is visible from my driveway, just a short  meters from our property. aposaposWe as a family are unable to leave our home to complete everyday tasks such as, buying bread and milk, leaving to attend work, doing the school run and other general errands without the reminder and the flashbacks of that horric night in which our lives changed forever.  aposaposSince the incident, Mrs Allen said the family have had to find another way around the estate because they cannot bear to drive past the site where flowers still lay at the roadside. The VW was found dumped a mile away and inquiries revealed it has been stolen from a house in Oldham the previous month. Matthews was arrested at a house in Liverpool five days later. He admitted knocking down Marcus before aposapospanickingaposapos and driving off. The court heard Matthews had  previous offences on his record including robbery, criminal damage and possessing cannabis and had been issued with an ASBO which he repeatedly ignored. He was banned from driving in  for driving without insurance or a license. In mitigation his lawyer Dominic Thomas said: aposaposThe defendant is profoundly sorry and he always will be for what he has done. It has been a deeply harrowing experience for Marcusapos family and there is no possibility of putting any of that right. He knows it will always be profoundly unfair he is here when Marcus is not.aposapos  Sentencing Matthews, Judge Hilary Manley told him: aposaposMarcus was just starting to find his feet in adult le and you took that le and all the promise and hope of his future from him. You have never held a driving licence, but that clearly hasn’t held you back from driving when you feel like it and it didn’t stop you from making the clear decision to get behind the wheel of a powerful, stolen vehicle and to casually treat it as your own, driving to a party, and thereafter, giving a lt to a friend. aposaposYou were travelling very rapidly and struck Marcus with force. I you had not been driving when you were not permitted to drive, and at such a grossly excessive speed, he would be alive today. aposaposMarcus’s mother had to find him where he had been flung, on the road, alone, looking like a discarded bag of garbage that had been fly-tipped. aposaposBy making yourself scarce, you have ensured that the police have not been able to establish whether or not you had been drinking or taking drugs at the party you attended before getting behind the wheel.aposapos aposaposMarcusapos brutal and untimely death has robbed him of his future. You have a young child but he will never know what it is to be a parent. You can look to a future that will start up again upon your release, when you are still only in your mid-twenties. He has no future and his family have nothing to look forward to which will not bring with it the searing ache of his absence.aposapos Matthews was also banned from driving for five years which will start when he is freed.

Joan Constantine, , had posted on a group called “We grew up in Salford” askinganybody knew of her father, Jim Harris, whom she had never met.Jean recognised the name and details, and quickly realised that Joan was her long lost half-sister that her father had in a previous marriage. The pair only knew rumours of each other’s existence.Have you got an incredible reunion story to tell  Email webnews@mirror Mother-of-two Jean had thought she was an only child after her older brother David, died when she was . Her dad, Jim Harris, was drove tanks during WW, and eventually became a bus driver in Salford until he passed away in  aged . While on a family holiday he told Jean, then , that he had been married before and had a daughter who was ten years older than her. Jean says that was all his father or mother Annie ever said about the situation, and she was hesitant to ask more after realising it was a contentious topic. Jean said: “He just came out with it one day and that was basically it, he wouldn’t really talk about it much, and I got more information off my mum that he wasn’t allowed to see his daughter. “I just became aware at the age of  that this woman existed, normally I’d be really happy to find out I had a sister, but there was something about this story that I knew I couldn’t go looking into. “Over the years I’d think about her, and they weren’t always friendly thoughts because I’d ask myself why she hasn’t tried to find us.” But older sister Joan, who also thought she was an only child, had been trying to find her dad for years.The -year-old mum-of-two now lives in Berkshire, and says she always wanted to know more about her dad but was unable to because of her ‘controlling’ mum who died in . She said: “I always felt a connection to my dad, he and my mother split up when I was very young, but I always felt that he loved me. “I knew he was there for my birth so I knew he would have held me and I think that connection always remained. “Me and Jean have lived two dferent lives, she comes from a very loving family and my mum was very controlling and I was never allowed to ask about my dad.” Joan spoke about a missed opportunity she had to meet her father, when she was  and rode the bus that Jim drove to work. Joan said: “I started working at , and I would take the number one from Langworthy Road to Pendleton Church and then the bus to Manchester. “Dad was a bus driver in Eccles and he drove the number one bus, he must have noticed me. “One morning I got on the bus and his we Annie was sat next to me, I didn’t know her at the time. “She tapped me on the knee and said ‘that bus driver is your dad, do you want to go and meet him  “I was in shock, I just panicked and didn’t say anything and just got off the next stop. “I was scared of my mum blowing upshe ever found out.” Joan eventually got married and moved out of Salford to set up her le down south with a husband and two children in her mid twenties. Cursing her missed opportunities but knowing her father’s name, she said she continued to look for him through registries, ancestry websites and even visited a mystic to askshe would ever find her father. She said: “I always felt like there was something inside me, I felt as though there was a thread connecting me and my dad.” She said she finally got the courage to put the post on the Facebook group after being encouraged by a friend. Jean added: “It was almost asit was fate. There’s this status from this lady and she started saying these things like her maiden name being Harris, like mine, where she lived, that her dad was a bus driver. “I’m reading this and I couldn’t believe it, I’m getting goosebumps now just thinking about it. “I had to read it several times, and the best thing about it for me was that she said she was so sad that she didn’t know my dad. “I couldn’t just do nothing, so I got in touch, I knew who she was, that was my sister.” Jean messaged Joan the next day sending photos of her dad and his driving licence. After a moment of ‘shock’, Joan called Jean the following day and the pair were beside themselves. Jean said: “She rang me and we were both as giddy as anything. “We spent six months talking on the phone and it was like we’d always known each other. “We just immediately got on, I was the one who had to prove myself, that I wasn’t just some random woman having a laugh.” Due to the pandemic the pair couldn’t meet as soon as possible and had to wait six months after making contact when restrictions were lted. The pair have been making up for all those years missed connecting the dots and introducing children and grandchildren to each other. Despite never meeting in person until now, both sisters inherited their father’s love for driving. Jean who now lives in Stockport was a driving instructor for  years and Joan, now retired, is an avid driver. So much so that Jean gted Joan their father’s driving gloves which she wears to feel close to him. Joan said: “Jean has been so generous. She’s let me into the family and given me things that belonged to my dad. “People search for years and they never find something they’re looking for. “Growing up I always thought I was an only child but my sister lived just  minutes away. “I’m so happy I feel like I could burst, it’s fabulous, just fabulous!” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveRelationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nicholas Hutchins, who admitted he had jealous tendencies, hatched a plan to stab his we to death before killing himself after she left him. At around am on July , , Hutchins waited in an alley outside the house she was staying in on Valley Row, Sutton, armed with a seven inch kne, My London reported. When she left for work he cornered her in the alley before repeatedly attempting to stab her in the chest, telling her she shouldnapost have left him and yelling “I love you”. Mrs Hutchins blocked the kne with her arm, leaving her bleeding heavily with four stab wounds, before a neighbour rushed out and pinned her husband to the ground. After his arrest Hutchins said: If I canapost have her, no one can have her. Hutchins, of Wellow Walk in Carshalton, appeared in Croydon Crown Court today after pleading guilty to attempted murder. The court was told that he had a history of violence towards his we and at the time of the attack he was on police bail for stalking her. The court heard that the couple had been married for more than three decades and had two children together, but Mrs Hutchins said he had been possessive throughout their relationship.  His violence towards her escalated in recent years, prosecutor Mark Mullins told the court. In  he became very jealous when she and her friends went to see the Dream Boys, an all male stripping group. When she ed from the show he was very drunk and he called her a slag before punching her in the face as she removed her makeup. As she blocked his punch he broke her knuckle. On that occasion she called the police and he was arrested, but was only convicted of harassment rather than assault and got off lightly with a suspended sentence. Judge Nicholas Ainley described this as the first warning sign of the violence that was to come. The couple were still together in March  when she went on a trip to Butlins with her sister. When she didnapost answer his calls he called her a slag, causing Mrs Hutchins to fear he might attack when she got home. A few days later she went back to the house they shared, accompanied by police. They found Hutchins in the garden with her clothes in a pile doused in white spirit. Hutchins was holding a lighter and threw spirit over the two officers who accompanied her. When he was arrested he admitted to officers: I get jealous about things, not silly jealous, maybe jealous isn’t the right word. I love her to death, she’s the only girl I’ve ever known. The only girl I’ve ever kissed.” On this occasion he was given a community order for assaulting emergency workers and attempted to destroy property. At this point Mrs Hutchins decided to leave her husband and moved in with her sister and her sisteraposs partner. But a few months later, in July, Hutchins began stalking his we. He chased the bus she was on and then he turned up at her sisteraposs home begging to see her. She reported these incidents to police, who charged him with stalking and released him on bail with the condition that he couldnapost contact her. On July , , just days after he was released on police bail, Hutchins decided he would try to kill his we. As she left to get a bus to Mitchim at am he was hiding in an alley. As she walked past she didnapost recognise him until he was around three metres away. He came towards her, raising a hand above his head and said: I love you, you shouldnapost have left me. She thought he was going to punch her so put her hand up to block but felt a sharp pain and realised she had been stabbed. While she managed to block his kne a neighbour ran out and tackled him to the ground. Her sisteraposs partner then joined the neighbour in pinning Hutchins to the ground until police arrived. As Mrs Hutchins was taken to an ambulance Hutchins called out: I love you. He was arrested before being taken to a doctor for injuries he sustained while he was pinned to the ground. While talking with a doctor Hutchins confessed his plan, saying he wanted to “kill her and then kill myself”. He was arrested for attempted murder. In a victim impact statement read in Court, Mrs Hutchins said she felt as though her husband had “stolen” her future. “I also feel like Iaposve lost my husband,” she said. “Although he wasnapost the best he was my husband. I also feel that my children and grandchildren have lost him. I also feel sorry for his family as they have lost their brother or son. His mother wonapost talk to me as she feels it was my fault. I never wanted this to happen. I just wanted him to get help. Defending him in court, Nasreen Shah said his behaviour could be explained by a brain injury he suffered in . A piece of scaffolding fell on him in his workplace, causing a build up of fluid on the brain. He had a shunt fitted and was on medication with strict instructions not to drink alcohol. However, he had fallen into a pattern of drinking resulting in violent outbursts and memory loss, Ms Shah told the court. However, Mrs Hutchins disputed that this injury changed him as a person, and said that he was possessive and controlling long before his injury. On the day of the attack he had drunk six cans of beer, telling police he had done it for Dutch courage. He initially pleaded not guilty to attempted murder but on the day of his trial he changed his plea to guilty. Sentencing Hutchins, Judge Ainley said: His attitude was thathe couldnapost live with her, no one  could. He tried to kill her that day. This man presents a real and very present danger to his we. He gave Hutchins an extended sentence of  years, made up of  years in prison and then a further three years on licence.

The ft-long beast was first spotted floating through the canal with the old motorcycle rubber tyre around its body just below its head in Palu City, in Indonesiaaposs Sulawesi province in .Experts feared that the saltwater crocodile would be strangled as its body continued to grow while the tyre refused to budge.

But this mildness is reportedly most noticeable in patients who have already been vaccinated. Most children have not been vaccinated, which experts believe has opened a route for Omicronaposs mutations to hit them harder.  Dr Andrew, who works at Primary Children’s Hospital in Utah, said: There is reason to think that acts dferently in younger children. We are seeing the sht towards more disease in younger children that probably has to do with changes in the virus.Dr Andrew says Omicron seems to attack the upper airways to a greater extent than the lungs, reports The Sun. And because younger children have smaller airways, it affects them dferently. The doctor said the children who became unwell enough with Omicron to need hospital care often presented with a specic cough - that sounds like a dogaposs bark, he said. This type of cough, described as croup-like by medics, is not thought to be harmful to the kids. But it is still unpleasant for parents hearing the harsh sound, which can naturally increase their concerns. The sinuses of children are smaller than adults, and can become blocked easily, and in turn cause inflammation that can spark a harsh cough. A common cold infection experienced as mild by an adult, could cause more problems for a child. When Omicron settles and causes inflammation in the upper airway, infected children will present a cough that seems more severe and may even need breathing assistance, Dr Andrew said.Omicron also infects patients in a dferent way to the previous strains - which ed deeper into the lungs where it could cause more le-threatening illness. At the end of last year, experts shared a list of the specic Omicron symptoms parents should watch out for in children.

And royal fans are convinced she did this last week and used her outfit to drop a major hint that the Duchess of Cornwall was about to be publicly backed by the Queen to be Queen Consort - days before she released her bombshell statement. It came last Thursday when Kate joined Prince Charles and Camilla for a rare joint day out in East London.She was invited by her father-in-law to join him and his we at Trinity Buoy Wharf, a centre in East London run by the Princeaposs Foundation, where traditional textile skills are taught. For the occasion, Kate recycled a chic grey coat dress by Catherine Walker that she teamed with black tights and black heels. And royal fans have pointed out that another time she wore the same ensemble was in  during an engagement at Kingaposs College, London - where she was invited to join the Queen.According to Hello! one royal fan commented on Instagram : Does this mean that Kate made the appearance and wore the grey dress again with Camilla that she last wore with the Queen to a very subtle hint at the announcement about Camilla being Queen Consort   Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. While another added: Itaposs not the first time sheaposs worn grey with Camilla and Charles. And the first time she wore this coat was when she accompanied the Queen on an engagement. I donapost think itaposs a coincidencethat makes sense. Meanwhile, others pointed out it was noticeable that Kate opted for an outfit in a muted grey colour, while Camilla wore green, in order not to outshine her.On Saturday night, just two days after the royal trioaposs outing, the Queen released an extraordinary message on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee expressing her sincere wish for Camilla to be Queen Consort when Charles is King.  When Camilla wed Charles in , a statement said she intended to use the title Princess Consort, rather than Queen Consort, when her husband becomes King.It followed low popularity ratings after she was thrust into the spotlight when it was revealed she had been having an affair with Charles during his marriage to Princess Diana.However, following rising public opinion, the Queen issued an extraordinary statement on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee on Saturday saying it was her sincere wish for Camilla to be Queen. The monarch said: I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me. And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.

Lesley Hill claims her top-up payments have been going directly to other companiesapos bank accounts for six years.It means Scottish Power hadnapost received a payment from Lesley since , despite her putting money into the pre-paid meter every week. The mum-of one was sent letters warning her of her debts before she took the matter to the Ombudsman. An investigation ordered Scottish Power to apologise and recommended the firm issue a aposgoodwill awardapos. Lesley, , from Knightswood, Glasgow, said the Ombudsman offered her £ but has criticised the gesture as aposlaughableapos.  She has called on the energy supplier to clear her debts and claimed it was their mistake. Lesley said: Iaposm still here, sitting with this debt until it is resolved. I donapost understand why they canapost just clear it and write it off for me, and fix it in the background  Scottish Power has admitted it was their mistake, so why am I still suffering from this debt  The Ombudsman said that they would give me £ as a goodwill gesture but I think that is pretty poor and laughable, really. I have had sleepless nights, heart palpitations and stomach pains due to this. I had to call my GP today to increase my anxiety medication because I just donapost see this nightmare ending any time soon. Lesley switched from a credit to a pay-as-you-go account in  after the breakdown of her marriage. At the time, she owed the energy firm £ - which she agreed to pay up in weekly instalments. She said the meter worked perfectly for one year before she started receiving warning letters from Scottish Power over arrears. Lesley said the energy giant is yet to accept the recommendations by the Ombudsman.  She said: The count number on the meter had been added with an extra digit and that is somehow why the money ended up going to three separate companies instead of Scottish Power. I have asked the Ombudsman how many extensions they are legally allowed to get because I fear this could go on for years. Two of these companies have gone bust and I just know that the matter wonapost be resolved in  days. It just feels as though I am fighting a losing battle and that it wonapost be fixed any time soon. It shows that no matter how hard you try to keep on top of payments, this could still inevitably happen at the end of the day and you could end up to your eyes in debt through no fault of your own. It just goes on and on. It has been a horrendous period, Iaposve been ill with stress and worry. I donapost understand how my meter worked fine for two years and then one day, it just tripped and started going to three dferent companies, I just canapost comprehend how that is possible. In a letter the watchdog has ordered Scottish Power to pursue a missing payment inquiry. This will ensure the firm allocates and applies all top-ups Lesley made to her electricity meter in the last six years to her current account. A Scottish Power spokesperson said: Weaposre very sorry for any stress this situation is causing Ms Hill. We are still working with Ms Hill and the Energy Ombudsman to fully resolve this case, including investigating where payments have been made to the other energy suppliers in order to help clear Ms Hillaposs debt.

Heather Prentice was giving evidence at a General Teaching Council for Scotland probe into the behaviour of Melissa Tweedie at the event in Glasgow. Itaposs claimed the former PE teacher partied with pupils at SWG nightclub before going back with them to a Premier Hotel.The then -year-old allegedly danced inappropriately with pupils before having sex with the pupil, who was , reports Glasgow Live. Deputy head Ms Prentice, , told the hearing yesterday: I had concerns about Melissa from the start of the dance regarding her outfit. Later in the evening I saw her up dancing with a glass of wine. She was up with a group of sixth year pupils. She claims she also saw: Pupil A and her taking shots at the bar.When it was time to leave the prom in June , Ms Prentice asked Tweedie how she was getting home. The Deputy Head recounted: She said she was getting a black hack. I told her I would arrange something for her. I told Melissa that there was a lt organised . When it was time for Tweedie - now  and working as a yoga teacher in Dubai - to leave Ms Prentice claimed she was unable to find her: I was told that she had left with sixth year pupils. I caught up to her on Kelvinhaugh Street. She was very reluctant to take advice and come with us. We couldnapost make her come with us, so we had to let her go. The Deputy said she was called by a colleague to a hotel across the river from SWG. She said: I got to the hotel across the river at about :am. Staff were checking CCTV to seeMelissa was there. Pupils had said that they had seen her in a room drinking alcohol. Mr Nicholls [Head Teacher] asked Melissa to send a ping to her location. She did not reply.  When replying to the presenting officeraposs cross examination from Gary Burton, she said in relation to the teacheraposs outfit: I do remember it was quite loose, short, low cut. I do remember that she looked like she was going on a night out. When asked about the nature of the dancing she said: It was all male pupils she was dancing with. I didnapost see any contact between her and any pupil. On her level of inebriation she said: She was not that drunk that she couldnapost walk. She was not that drunk that she was out of control. I told her she needed to be more careful here and the way she was seeing the situation was not the way the pupils were seeing it. I wanted her to recognise that the pupils were getting a bit titillated by it. Hearing convener, Arthur Stewart, then askedshe thought that she had actually spoken to her flatmate on the phone to get them to pick her up. Ms Prentice said: With hindsight, I wasnapost sure it was her flatmate on the phone. Iaposm trying to say I think she was on the phone to the sixth year pupil [Pupil A]. I havenapost got anything to back that up other than that she was blowing kisses and saying aposlove, love.apos Another pupil who was present at the prom was heard by the GTCS this afternoon. The pupil recounted: I was sitting at my table and I remember a chat between teachers that she needed to calm down. She then spoke about what she saw when she was staying at the Premier Inn after the night: I went back into the room as everyone was leaving to get a drink. Pupil A had his arms around the base of her back and she said to me aposCan we just pretend for a minute like Iaposm not your teacherapos. I left because it was quite weird. I went down the stairs for some food and I saw Mr Nicholls. He said aposwhere is she, where is she apos I think he meant Miss Tweedie. When being cross examined by Presenting Officer Gary Burton, she said: They were sitting on the edge of the double bed. She was competent enough to say aposcan we just pretend for a minute like Iaposm not your teacherapos to me. The pupil also recalled how Mr Nicholls looked quite startled.

Danny Walsh and Rick Webster were driving along the M last month when a lorry moved into their lane before continuing to drt across and crushing the front of the van. Their van was dragged against the central reservation of the motorway and left Danny and Rick fearing for their lives. They said the lorry then drove away without stopping to seethe two dads were hurt by the incident. Dashcam footage from the tradesmenaposs van showed Danny, the driver, moving to the outside lane to avoid a collision.  But they were soon trapped by the large vehicle, with the front of the van on the passenger side being crushed by the lorryaposs impact. The vehicle then slammed them against the central reservation, straightened up, before driving off. Danny and Rick were left stranded and exposed to the busy morning traffic on the motorway as a result, with Danny saying they were a few metres from death. Danny had luckily braked quickly in order to stop the entire van being crushed and thrown over to the other side of the motorway.  Danny said: We were a few metres and a split second away from being crushed. It could have been a whole lot dferent. Weaposre lucky. At first we just thought aposlook at this t***er, not indicating,apos and we thought he just wanted to come into that lane but then he just started coming out again and again. Before we knew it, there was nowhere  to go. People say you see your le flash before your eyes but we didnapost have time for that. We just thought aposOh s***.apos He explained thathe was in a hatchback rather than a van, they wouldnapost have stood a chance, with an HGV driver later telling them thathe hadnapost braked in time, they would have died.  Its a lucky escape. It was just natural instinct to slam on. He must have dragged us  yards along the central reservation then he just drove off. The lorry belongs to British distribution giants Bunzl, who have confirmed that the driver has been suspended while they investigate the accident. However, Danny said: Bunzl said he had a medical incident, buthe did have, he would have stopped, He straightened the wagon and drove off quite competently. Danny and Rick were terried that someone  would drive into them as they couldnapost look out the mirrors. They were luckily able to get across the motorway to safety. He added that he was really shaken up by the incident and that the van has been written off as a result.  He could kill someonehe did that again. I hope itaposs a wake up call for his driving. It could have been a family in that care and they wouldnapost have stood a chance, the dad-of-two said. His co-worker Rick, also a dad-of-two, said that the incident has left him with sleepless nights. If you think about it too much, it can keep you awake at night, but I want to know why he nearly made my kids fatherless. I feel unlucky that it happened but lucky we survived it.  He explained: I thought, aposThis could be it.apos It scared the le out of me. I thought of my family and I didnapost know I was going to get out alive.Since the incident, Rickaposs we Rachel posted the dashcam footage from the van onto Facebook to appeal for witnesses.West Yorkshire Police confirmed an incident involving four vehicles was reported on the morning of the incident, while Bunzl said they would be looking into the claims of a medical incident by the driver closely.A spokesperson for Bunzl said: We are aware of an incident involving a Bunzl vehicle.

Exposure to the poisons could spark a range of serious health conditions such as high cholestoral, type  diabetes and other conditions such as obesity which can lead to heart disease,. Those living in one particular county, south Cambridgeshire, are most at risk and the county is supplied by utility firm Cambridge Water. The company last June cut off a supply containing four times the aposlegal limitapos of perfluorooctane sulphonate . But the firm has not revealed how long people had been piped water before it was cut.  The contaminated water, it assures customers never reached taps and was instead blended with other sources.Those living in the area say they were never informed about the discovery last summer,reported.An estimated , people in the supply area are understood to have been affected.Residents of Stapleford and Great Shelford, where around , live, have heard “nothing at all” from Cambridge Water. And the title reports that while investigations happened, it “had not told the community”.  The Drinking Water Inspectorate limits PFOS to  nanograms per litre . Elinor Cordiner, head of drinking water quality and compliance at Cambridge Water, said sample surveys had happened to determinethere was any risk to customers after January . But it claomed all of the locations, apart from one, fell within tier , which the company says is the aposlowest riskapos category. A site at Duxford Airfield was in the tier  category, and tier  was the highest. Affected houses were supplied by an acquer which had PFOS levels at almost ng l - four times the legal limit.  Ms Cordiner said in a statement water supplies from this source have always been blended with other sources before reaching our customers. She added: This means that levels of PFAS at customer taps were at, or around, the tier level. The site was removed from supply as a precautionary measure and Cambridge Water is in the process of installing additional treatment at the site. It said: We confirm that we have not breeched any legal limit... We can assure customers that all drinking water in our supply region was, and remains to be, in line with expected safe levels.reports that Cambridge Water said it was “unable to guarantee a blend below ng l for our customers at all times”. But Tony Fletcher, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described levels in Duxford as “grossly exceeding recommended drinking water limits. PFOS, he said accumulate in the body and it takes a long time to remove them. The aquer sits close to Duxford airfield. and these sort of locations are known to be potentially signicant sources of PFOS according to the The Sun. Duxford airfield said no banned substances “are knowingly used anywhere across our estate” PFOS has gradually phased out since the early s after harm to the environment and human health. However, it is persistent in the environment. Due to its design, it never breaks down, dubbed a “forever chemical”.  Humans only come into contact with PFOS through contaminated food and water. A report from Public health England states:“studies with animals fed PFOS or PFOA for a long period showed effects on the stomach, liver and thyroid hormones”, but there is sparse information from human studies. At very high levels, animals exposed for prolonged periods were at risk of cancer. Jamie DeWitt, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at East Carolina University in the US, saiid people who had drank water over a sustained period have increased risk of certain types of diseases. These she said included cholestorol changes and lower vaccine antibody responses.

Mason James Cowgill was caught taking both hands off the wheel to crack open a bottle of Bollinger and chugging away at the alcoholic drink as he drove on the A in North Yorkshire.In the same footage, he is later seen rolling up a cigarette, which he puts behind his ear to smoke later, and using his mobile too. During both instances, heaposs distracted and takes his hands off the steering wheel. The terrying footage was captured on June , last year when he crashed into one car and nearly caused another crash. At one point in his journey, the van crashes into the back of a car which was stationary in traffic, police said.  The car was damaged in the collision but thankfully nobody was injured. Cowgill and the car driver exchanged details, but Cowgill left the scene before officers arrived. North Yorkshire Police said he was lucky he didnapost kill anyone as he continued his journey while making more phone calls to friends and almost caused another crash. Cowgill reported the collision to his boss, who owned the van, and he reviewed the in-cab footage. The boss sacked Cowgill, of Skipton, North Yorks., and sent the footage to the police. Cowgill pleaded guilty to dangerous driving in court, where he was disqualied for a period of  months including an extended retest. Speaking after his sentencing, PC Babs Parsons of North Yorkshire Police said: “Cowgill is lucky he did not kill or seriously injure someone that day.  “The manner in which he drove demonstrated a clear danger to other road users and I’m amazed he did not cause any more collisions. “This was not a momentary lapse in concentration, this is a sustained period in which Cowgill paid very little or no attention at all to the road and was clearly not in control of the van he was driving. “I thank the owner of the van for bringing this footage to our attention as it has enabled us to take a very dangerous driver off the road”.

A resident in Devon watched the incident unfold in the Alphington area around am today. The resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Devon Live that he was inside a nearby address when all of a sudden, he heard an unusually loud noise. The driver of the van was helping a friend or a family member move in,” they said. Suddenly I heard this noise. I canapost even describe it, as soon as I heard it I flew to the window. I saw the driver jump out of the van and he was screaming, effing and blinding. The roof ripped right off the entrance pillars and was on top of the van.The eye-witness adds that, although it was an unusual incident, he is surprised that it hasnapost happened before. He said: Usually that roof is sat up on pillars, and as he has gone to drive through he has made a bad judgement error - and at some speed i can imagine - and taken it off. I am surprised it hasnapost happened sooner because when I went outside to see what had happened, I saw that one of the pillars which was in the ground was soaking wet and looked rotten.” Around -minutes after the event took place, he said fire crews were on the scene, where they were “puzzled” about what had happened. “The AA also turned up but they have both gone now,” he said. The van has been moved and cordoned off, but it is blocking some spaces for other properties. It looks like it will be there for a while now. I spoke to the driver, he says they are trying to get hold of the car park owners to seethey can pull the roof off of the van, because obviouslythey do that it will smash into pieces. The resident was told by the driver that the van is a rental and that they may have to pay for a crane to remove the roof. The driver informed me that the van is a rental, and said the insurancerefused to help, the rental company refused to help, the firefighters said they didnapost know what to do and heaposd have to potentially pay privately for a crane, and AA then arrived as and they were baffled on what to do or how to help. A spokesperson for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they had been on the scene. A spokesperson said: Middlemore crew attended the incident from .am – .pm. They made sure the vehicle was safe. There was no major damage to the roof.

Sondra Theordore has spoken about the porn impresarioaposs alleged drug use in a new AE docuseries, Secrets for Playboy. She claimed Hefner, who she dated from  to , made her buy drugs for him asshe was picking up milk. How many times did I pick up drugs for Hef  I donapost know, countless. Countless times, Sondra claimed in the show. Iaposve never told anyone any of this before. I was too ashamed for a lot of reasons. But I was a drug mule for Hef. It was nothing to him. It was like sending me out for a quart of milk. ButI got caught, my le would be over.  Hefner died at the Playboy Mansion on September , , at the age of . Sondra has argued thatthe adult entertainment magnate was alive now, he would be behind bars. She has previously suggested that he groomed her from the age of  and thatshe had been caught with drugs, he would not have come to her aid. In the docuseries Sondra said Hefner would continuously sleep with other women during their relationship, and that he had a habit of turning the issue around on her. He said, aposDo you think that they can just stay in my house and not sleep with me apos she explained. Would you have dinner guests and expect that of them  No. It was just so cold and callous and not the man that Iaposve fallen in love with. I didnapost know who this man was. The -part docuseries has just released its fourth episode and delves into the hidden truths behind the fable and philosophy of the Playboy empire through a modern-day lens.  The shows creators promise that it will unravel the glamorous mythology created by the brand over several decades, the series features archival footage and exclusive interviews with insiders from all facets of the Playboy world. Sondra said she tried to leave him many times but was reeled back in with his charm. Decades later she considers him a aposvampireapos and that he sucked the le out of girls for decades. You couldnapost satisfy him. He wanted more and more and more, she recalled. The group sex was at least five nights a week. They had a protocol. He liked to direct and you didnapost segue away from it because you could tell it irritated him.It just got ugly, I felt like I was a ringmaster, I had to put the same show on every night. In a previous episode Lisa Loving Barrett, his executive assistant during the late s and aposs, said cocaine was a aposbig dealapos in the Playboy Mansion. She claimed there was a powder room off the great hall and that a pile of cocaine was hidden under a toilet roll holder. Sondra said one of Hefneraposs dogs got addicted to the drug by licking it off the floor.Former Playboy Bunnies Karissa and Kristina Shannon recently revealed grim details of Hefneraposs bedtime ritual.The blonde twins stayed in the Playboy mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, for two years, after being recruited to live with the tycoon when he saw pictures of a glamour shoot they had done. Karissa and Kristina were flown from Florida to LA, moving in with Hefner and his girlfriends - including Kendra Wilkinson - and being given , a week to star on the hit reality show Girls Next Door, which documented the lives of the women living in the  million mansion.  They told the Daily Mirror it was worlds away from what they originally thought they would be signing up to. Kristina said they were regularly given drugs as part of Hefner’s bizarre bedtime routine, before they were forced into having group sex with the pensioner and a gaggle of other women. Karissa said they were told the drugs - including weed and quaaludes - would help them feel more comfortable. “He pulled out silk pyjamas from Italy and we put them on. He pulled out this big pill like the type a horse would take. It was quaalude, which we found out he used all the time,” Kristina said of their first experience in the tycoon’s bedroom. “He told us the drugs would help with our anxiety. We smoked some pot. We felt frozen at first but after a while the pill made us loose and fuzzy,” Karissa said, as she confessed he would touch them while they were under the influence. “He kept saying, ‘My babies, my babies,’ and cradling us as we lay either side of him. He told us to call him ‘Papa’,” she added, calling him “the devil” for what he had done to them.

The mum, from Long Island, was targeted after visiting Walt Whitman Shops in South Huntington, New York, on January .She recalled how a woman was filming her as she left the US store and then made her way home where she parked on the drive at Deer Park. But as she helped her child inside, she spotted a man get out of a gold Honda Odyssey, smash her car window and steal the designer bag. He then got back in the Honda and fled the scene, she added. Police said the force has surveillance images of the suspects. Officers have asked anyone with more information to get in touch.  During the pandemic, shop and auto thefts have risen by around  per cent throughout the US, according to the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail President Ben Dugan. The increase in crime is thought to be a knock-on effect after businesses were forced to close and people lost their jobs. Michael Lipetri, chief of NYPD crime patrol strategies, told CBS he has seen “a sharp uptick in shoplts that then turn into robberies”.  He added: “A lot of people were out of work and a lot of people were trying to make ends meet, obviously the wrong way.” Shoplting incidents in New York have reached levels not seen in almost three decades, the police department has reported. More than , such crimes were reported in New York between January and September  following more than , during the same period the pervious year. Ulta Beauty stores in Suffolk County were impacted more than  times by organised retail thieves in the first half of . “It’s brazen, and it’s a trend nationally, and certainly a trend out here,” said Mathew Lewis, chief of detectives at Suffolk County Police.

Diego, a black and white Great Dane, is taller than his six-foot owner when standing on hind legs.Almost everyone knows him near his east London home and taking the tube can be a nightmare with large crowds of doggy fans, reports MyLondon.Diego is so popular that even the police have even stopped him in the street to take photographs. Owner Carlos takes Diego with him everywhere, and the pair love riding through central London in a two-wheeled motorbike together. The Great Dane even has a pair of dog goggles that fit his head - so he can ride in style. to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Carlos, who is originally from Brazil, bought Diego in . His we, Ellie, was terried of dogs, and had taken some persuading . On Christmas Day, they got the call: a breeder had one Great Dane left. And so, at am, Carlos set off for Peterborough to collect Diego. Ellie may have had her reservations, but Diego has won her round. Now,I asked her to choose [between] me or Diego, Diego would stay, says Carlos. She does everything for them - they control the house. At kgs, Diego is taller than six-foot Carlos when standing on his hind legs.  Diego has been known to steal food from strangers. He steals food everywhere - heaposs not very well-behaved with food. If some guys are having lunch and they blink, Diego will grab it, Carlos said. Carlos has tried to put Diego on a diet, but itaposs tricky - strangers in the park will readily dispense treats to their favourite Great Dane, and thereaposs also the issue of pizza. If he sees pizza, his favourite food, he gets crazy - heaposs a dferent dog. Heaposll do anything for pizza, he explains. Six years after getting Diego, he and Carlos are inseparable. Everywhere I go, I take Diego, says Carlos, explaining that when he sits down - on the sofa, on the Tube, to put his shoes on - Diego will always sit on his lap. Docile Diego will happily accompany Carlos to the pub, on the Tube, or join him at a restaurant. At The Bike Shed, a motorcycle club in Shoreditch, Diego is the first dog in the venueaposs history to have become a Gold Member.When we go there, it says on the table: aposThis table is reserved for Diego and his human, Carlos says. Diego is well-liked. In Victoria Park, where he takes his morning walk, he has doting fans whoaposll slip him treats at work at Bravos Motorcycles, people will regularly drop by to see him or take him for a walk. Because of his size and black and white colouring, some children even mistake him for a cow. In East London, almost everyone knows him, says Carlos. If you have a Great Dane, everyone wants to come and talk and take pictures. This can be a liability. The Tube is a nightmare sometimes...one [person] wants to take a photo, and then another one, and then thereaposs a crowd, Carlos said.  Driving together on the motorbike, theyaposve also been stopped by the police. Carlos thought they were in trouble - but it turned out that they too just wanted a photo of the pair together. Sometimes when we stop, people donapost want to pass - they want to see him, and it makes a traffic jam, says Carlos, who has taken to wearing a balaclava to keep a low profile. That said, Carlos is pleased to have Diego by his side, and I sense that he enjoys some of the popularity that Diego and Nelson bring. He says: If you want to meet people and make friends, walk a Great Dane in London. Six year-old Diego has an adopted brother, Nelson, aged two. Currently, itaposs just Diego who travels in the sidecar, but Carlos is keen to teach Nelson to ride with him too. Nelson is a completely dferent dog, says Carlos, explaining that where Diego is calm, Nelson is jittery, afraid of smaller dogs. As a Great Dane, heaposs more active. Heaposs crazy - heaposs the opposite of Diego. In spite of their dferences, the two dogs are best friends, says Carlos - although Nelson, despite being around kgs lighter than Diego, is the alpha.Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsGreat DaneChristmasVehiclesAdoptionPizza\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Looking for advice, she wrote: “I’ll genuinely get this uneasy, unsettled feeling sometimes because I’ll look up and realise she’s just been staring me down. “I’ve had dogs my entire le. I’ve also worked as a kennel attendant. I’ve never had a dog make me feel so uneasy. I feel awful saying all of this, but it’s true. She’s always watching me.” In a desperate attempt to get a momentaposs peace, she admits to sending her dog to its crate a lot more than she normally does.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  “I don’t want her around me. I genuinely feel smothered by her. It’s stressing me out,” she said. The woman adopted the three-year-old dog with her boyfriend about nine months ago - but she is the primary caregiver. She added: “Being that I’m the one home most of the time, I’ve put in a lot of work with her. She very clearly has an attachment to me because of this. “She gets really anxious when I leave her. My boyfriend will try to console her when it’s just him at home with her, but she’ll just pace around the house and sit by the door waiting for me to get back. “She has such an anxious attachment to me specically that it actually makes me anxious.  “I know she looks to me for protection and safety, and I’m honoured she sees me this way. I’m proud of how far she’s come since bringing her home. “But, constantly being watched and followed is wearing on my nerves. I’m constantly having to say “Back up” or “Go get in your bed” or “Excuse me” just to get basic tasks done around my house.” The woman asked her vet to put the dog on anxiety medication - but they advised against this, instead telling her to seethe dogaposs symptoms ease in the coming months. Despite ensuring all her dog’s needs are met, and providing her with the love and attention she deserves, some have questioned the womanaposs level of care. One user said: Your dog is from two worker dog breeds that need hours of exercise a day ideally. I know it is a lot but it is what those dogs are bred to do - herd for hours and hours.

Owner Lisa Kite, , began teaching her nine-year-old dog, Ivy, how to paint when she was just aged two. After noticing how quickly she picked it up, Lisa started trying her out with dferent types of paint, starting with watercolours before moving on to acrylics. Lisa, from North Carolina, US, said: It didnapost take long to teach her how to paint she was painting within a week. Initially, I trained her to get a beer from the fridge to impress my adult children when they came to visit and from there, I taught her lots of dferent tricks.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Sheaposll do the basic commands like sit, roll over and shake but sheaposs learned how to sort the washing, take my jacket off, wipe her feet, and put coins in the bank. We have a two-page spreadsheet of dferent tricks now. The Australian shepherd’s paintings have a range of names, from aposMeringueapos to aposJungle Catapos, and prices y, with her most expensive work of art selling for £.  Lisa added: Iaposve given so many paintings away but we sell them all over the world Iaposm blown away by how many people want one of her paintings. Despite not being an artist herself, Lisa loves seeing the art her pup creates and sets Monday as their day of the week to paint, with Ivy having five paintings on the go at once. Lisa donates the profits from Ivyaposs artwork to local charities and food banks in their area. She said: This is fun for Ivy she is trained using positive reinforcement and is putting good into the world. Iaposm not an artist but I love art and have learned a lot from Ivy. She only adds one colour to each painting per week to make sure weaposre not diluting the colours. As long as sheaposs busy, sheaposs happy and we make sure to walk her five miles a day on top of that. We give the profits away to charity itaposs usually animal welfare charities but also food banks. I love the idea that there is a dog working to help other dogs and pets in the world.Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As the Daily Star reports, the photo was taken in the s when three crew members were sent to orbit to perform an engineering test of the first crewed lunar module.During the mission, they took photos of the crew member doing a spacewalk, and in the background of the image is what Tyler believes to be a UFO. What do you think of Tyleraposs sighting  Let us know in the comments...On his YouTube channel, Tyler said: This is a photo snapped by one of the astronauts doing space walks before coming safely back down to Earth. In one of the photos, they took thousands and thousands of miles away from Earth, a dark triangular craft seen above Earth in shuttle missions that happened many decades later. This was discovered to be lurking among these clouds – all the way back in the s when this photo was taken. He zooms into the picture, showing a black dot among the clouds lurking in the background. He continued: Itaposs still hard to see but when we go all the way in, we get yet another dark triangle UFO, seems to be at an angle asitaposs flying right above the clouds, right at the line where the Earth atmosphere meets space.Almost like itaposs orbiting the Earth along with the astronauts whoaposs likely when snapping this photo had no idea that this mysterious black, triangular was. His fans were convinced that the photo was a solid proof of the existence of UFOs. One said: Incredible! That photo taken from space all those years back catching that triangle is solid proof for me. Another shared: I saw a triangle flying a few months ago, but it was going flat side first not the point. Is there a chance that the astronaut photo could be space debris or something  This stuff fascinates me beyond belief! a third asked.The image bears a similarity to the infamous Black Knight UFO. Believers in the conspiracy claim the ominous dark shape of an alien origin is orbiting Earth. Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

We can be better than this week, and we believe Wales will be better than they showed this week.“Being tough to beat is really important.

estimated, new night-time surveying suggests.Initial results of a count using a methodology developed in Scotland indicate the population densities of the hares are between two and five times higher than recent data drawn from other sites in the national park.The Game and Wildle Conservation Trustwhich led the research, said the findings are “welcome news” for the species – though they still face many threats including climate change.Mountain hares are native to Scotland and died out in England during the last Ice Age.But they were introduced into the English uplands in the mid-s by shooting estates, surviving now only in the Peak District.The counting method, developed in Scotland by GWCT with the James Hutton Institute and NatureScot as a more reliable technique for counting hare numbers than previously used, involves recording numbers of hares seen along regular transects through the landscape at night.It was undertaken by the Peak District Moorland Group, part of the Moorland Association, with gamekeepers counting hares across  grouse moor estates in the Dark Peak area of the national park.Lead author of the study Dr Nick Hesford, from the GWCT, said: “Preliminary results suggest that the numbers of hares recorded by gamekeepers may be equivalent to a population density of around - mountain hares per square kilometre.“This is similar to the densities recently recorded in their core range in Scotland and between two to five times higher than the most recent estimates at other sites in the national park.”And he said: “The threats of traffic accidents, the isolation of the Peak District population, disease and climate change remain, but this survey is welcome news for the species.“Although we only have data from one year of surveys so far, the adoption of this new methodology in the Peak District is a breakthrough for the population, and it is our hope this survey continues to help conservation efforts in the future.”.removeDr Hesford said the first year of surveying had delivered “very much preliminary results”, but it will inform long-term monitoring that will help with their conservation.There was previously limited data on the population in the Peak District, drawn from other areas which are not managed as grouse moors.Dr Hesford suggested the higher population density found in the latest survey is likely to be partly due to the more effective method of counting and partly due to the way in which the sites being analysed are managed.The GWCT said mountain hares benefit from the conditions grouse moor keepers maintain for boosting numbers of red grouse, such as heather burning that produces new young shoots which they eat, and control of predators such as foxes and stoats.\" data-title\"Snow in the Peak District, home to

in the Peak District, home to England’s only population of mountain hares In Scotland, unlicensed killing of mountain hares has been banned, while in England the species can be managed through shooting but the population must be maintained in a favourable conservation status.Climate change threatens the mountain hares by creating a mismatch between the periods when they have their white winter coat camouflage and when there is snow cover on the ground.A shorter snowy period in winter means the white hares stand out on the brown and green ground, making them easy prey for predators.“Because of the way in which grouse moors are managed, even in the face of climate change it’s likely these areas – provided they are managed in the same way – will provide habitat for mountain hares,” Dr Hesford said.Richard Bailey, Peak District Moorland Group co-ordinator who helped arrange the surveys, said: “Mountain hares are predominantly nocturnal animals, so it makes sense that the night-time counts are providing more successful and reliable population estimates than daytime counting.“This population of mountain hares has survived thanks to the habitat management and predator control undertaken by gamekeepers in the Dark Peak area.“This research confirms that the hard work is still benefiting the species.”Wildle groups have criticised grouse moor estates for heather burning which, they say, damages the habitat and carbon storage, and amid concerns over the illegal killing of hen harriers which prey on grouse chicks.But estate owners say they are undertaking action for wildle conservation and preventing wildfires, have zero tolerance to illegal persecution of birds of prey, and the shoots provide rural jobs and economic benefits..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Mountain hare populations in Peak District higher than thought, count

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

Good Friday is on  April and Easter Monday on  April.This means payments should be made on Thursday  April.Even though the payment will be given slightly earlier, the amount that is paid will remain the same.The only time the amount will be dferent isyour circumstances change, such as changes to living arrangements, bank details, immigration status, or finding a job.As Universal Credit is calculated based on your specic circumstances, claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensions anything changes that could affect your payments.A change in circumstance could mean you are claiming benefits you are no longer entitled to.This is illegal andthe DWP suspects benefit fraud, claimants could be visited by a Fraud Investigation officer and payments may be stopped.Claimants who do not receive their payment on time should contact the Universal Credit helpline.This can be done online via your account, or by calling   .The next bank holiday after April falls on  May, which is a Monday.As such, claimants who normally get paid on this day of the month should expect to receive their payment earlier on Friday  April.Other benefit payments are also likely to be paid on a dferent date due to bank holidays as well.This could affect those who receive Employment support allowance, Jobseekers allowance, Carers allowance, Pension credit, Personal Independence Payments and Attendance allowance."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-covid-update-today-time-watch","story":"Final restrictions put in place in response to the Omicron iant sweeping across Scotland have been removed since Monday, January .In last week’s update the First Minister has confirmed that following the cabinets three-week review, the current Covid measures will not change.Changes were however announced for international travel.

We called on both the UK and Scottish governments to appropriately fund the citys cultural collections through A Fair Deal for Glasgow.An Arabesque Carpet being reinstalled at the Burrell Collection The funding for the Burrell revamp is an example of groups coming together and last October the UK Governmnet announced a £million package for the museum.Nearly half of the funding for the £. million project was committed by Glasgow City Council with more than a quarter coming from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and signicant donations from the Scottish Government, the UK Government, and from many generous trusts and private donors.Caroline Clark, Director for Scotland, The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said the revitalised building now showcases this extraordinary collection in a modern and open space that is accessible to everyone.\"Thanks to National Lottery players, our £. million in funding has secured strong outcomes for The Burrell Collection and the many people who will enjoy visiting in the future, helping to drive tourism to the area and ensure that this wonderful Collection can be enjoyed for many generations to come,\" Ms Clark said:Culture Minister Neil Gray said he was delighted it would reopen to the public again adding: \"The Scottish Government has contributed £. million in funding to the project which includes £, to support cost increases due to the pandemic. This ambitious project will ensure the building, with its greatly expanded exhibition space, will be more accessible to the public for years to come.\"Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: “It will be a proud moment for Glasgow – and for all of Scotland – to see the iconic Burrell Collection open its doors again on March . The £million UK Government investment, on top of another £million already spent on refurbishment, recognises the Burrell’s rich cultural contribution nationally and internationally. The improvements made will future-proof this stunning space, attract world-class exhibitions and entice visitors totime and time again, boosting the economy.”New displays will give visitors a better understanding of the international signicance of The Burrell Collection’s artworks, as well as the people who made them and some of the people who have owned them. The displays include innovative digital elements such as video walls, interactives and hybrid systems created to help people engage with the stories behind the collection.Since The Burrell Collection closed to the public in October , a comprehensive consulation programme has engaged with more than , local people who have given their ideas, insights and opinions. This input has shaped every aspect of the redesign of the building, access to it and the development of the new displays, galleries and spaces within and around the museum.The Scottish Parliament passed a bill in  which would allow international loans of objects from and to The Burrell Collection. While it was closed, objects from the Collection were seen by more than a million people on loan to museums in New York, Paris, Japan and London. "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stop-causing-needless-alarm-elderly-pensions","story":"I don’t doubt the complexity, but have the authors overstated the uncertainty The UK Government’s own document “State Pensionyou retire abroad” states in its first sentence “You can claim State Pension abroadyou’ve paid enough UK National Insurance contributions to qualy”, making clear that following payment of contributions there is a liability to pay a state pension, consistent with the terms of the scheme at the time.Of course, these terms can change, “reduce, or even, in principle, eliminate”. Certainly, the state pension has ied in real value over the years, but it is no less clear that, in any post-Yes vote negotiation, pension liability could not be valued on the basis of something that might or might not happen several years later.As for elimination of pensions, the politics of telling the UK’s grey vote, and the expats all over the world, that they are not getting their pension any more is, in terms of political disaster, much worse even than Downing Street parties.Likewise, it is possible that the UK Government might challenge its liability on the basis that “the tax and NICs made by Scottish residents were used to pay for public services that they previously enjoyed”, but this is not what its own website says. Moreover, would this argument be applied to pensioners in the continuing UK Lastly, as the authors point out, “the UK Government can change the qualying rights for state pensions as it sees fit”. However, how can this be done to exclude only Scots. What would a requirement, for instance, to live in the continuing UK mean for British expats living in Spain Many of the uncertainties in the report are therefore just too horrible politically to contemplate, or involve so many dficulties that their complications would surely triumph. The logical solution is surely to negotiate an agreement about ision of assets and liabilities, and secure reciprocal agreements. I don’t doubt the complexity or that certainty is imperfect, but with goodwill on both sides, rather than weaponising the issue to cause fear among the elderly, I am sure a solution agreeable to both sides can be forthcoming.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SNPS WISHFUL THINKINGI NOTE the debate on the SNP’s assertions that the UK would fund Scottish pensions after independence. This is an extreme case of wishful thinking, as today’s taxes pay pensions, because there is no pension pot to draw on.At present the workers in the  million population pay the pensions of that population. If Scotland were to be independent, surely the workers in the  million population of rUK would pay the pensions of that population and the workers in the six million population of Scotland would pay our pensions Why would the UK Government agree to fund, out of current taxation, the pensions liability of a dferent country, when that country is receiving the tax from their own workers at the same time Scotland has a demographic handicap with fewer working people supporting all forms of benefit. The SNP solution to this is large immigration of young people, which kicks the can down the road as they will all be old and entitled to a pension one day. Pension planning in the UK and Scotland is broadly similar to a Ponzi scheme, where increasing the population gives more workers to pay pensions and benefits. This lets politicians pass the problems associated with us all living longer down to the next generation.Nicola Sturgeon says that people will notice no dference or get a bigger pension this is extremely unlikely, given that it would need the UK politicians to completely capitulate to the SNP viewpoint.The experts writing in your paper on Saturday, David Bell of the University of Stirling and David Eiser of the Fraser of Allander Institute, seemed to suggest that a fudge agreement would be most likely .Certainly more of a drawback to, than an advantage of, independence.John Leonard, Falkirk.HAVE A PLAN BEFORE THE SPLITTHE dissolution of the United Kingdom brought on by Scottish independence means that the two newly-independent entities would have no claim to UK Treasury funding as the UK would have ceased to exist. In other words pensions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland would not be paid by the UK nor would Scotland’s pensions.Arrangements would have to be made prior to the split ensuring that the qualying conditions for pension payments to former UK pensioners apply equally to both new states perhaps continuing to be based on the qualying conditions of the former UK pension scheme.Payments up to the date of the split could be overseen by a joint board of the two new states and financed by the same mechanism as before. In effect all previous UK pensions would continue to be paid as normal and from the same revenue base. This revenue stream would be the same as before but now burcated. Both new states could then review the amount of pension paid within their jurisdictions.Don Ferguson, Kirkintilloch.WE NEED ALL THE ANSWERS EARLYI WOULD sincerely hope that all negotiations regarding finance, pensions, taxation, border controls and so on are satisfactorily settled before any independence vote. Otherwise the Scottish electorate will have no understanding of the effects of voting Yes.No intelligent person votes for something without knowing what they will get as a result.Previous voters were not told of the chaos which would ensue when voting to leave. We need the truth of the outcomes before there is a vote.Barbara Jarvie, Milton of Campsie.NORWAY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICESI ALMOST choked on my Corn Flakes this morning while reading Michael Sheridans letteron the subject of Norway.Norway, in his view it seems, is only a thriving economy thanks \"disproportionately\" to the might of Great Britain and the United States, who apparently have kept the \"free world\" open and alive to capitalist endeavour. That world order, it would appear, has provided infinite pathways, both physical and financial, for Norway to expand and flourish.No mention of the mighty \"free world\" heroes having invaded or plundered other nations, stolen their resources or having killed their indigenous populations throughout history, in pursuit of the great capitalist utopia. Mr Sheridan goes on to deride Norway for pursuing \"a long-standing policy of military neutrality and exclusion of nuclear weapons\". How very dare they!We are urged by Mr Sheridan to believe that the rest of the \"free world\" is to be grateful to the might of Great Britain and the United States for the free flow of capitalism, and that Norway is a political passenger and a fortunate beneficiary of our unparalleled might.Hilarious.Kevin Orr, Bishopbriggs.* I AGREE with Michael Sheridan that Norway is not a legitimate comparator for Scotland but disagree with his reasons for saying so. The crucial dference, which appears to have escaped Mr Sheridans notice, is that Norway is an independent nation and Scotland is not. He employs the blatant oxymoron of explaining thatall the nations of the free world shared Norways aversion to militarism and nuclear weapons there would be no free world.Norway, as a free and independent nation in the s, was able to make its own choices regarding North Sea oil and gas our Scottish nation was in a very dferent situation and it is now clear that great efforts were made by the UK Government at that time to conceal the full potential economic benefits of North Sea resources from the people of Scotland.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WILL THE SPIN DOC SURVIVE BORIS Johnson’s new Director of Communications, Guto Harri, told the press that our beloved and boisterous PM sang \"I Will Survive\" when they met on Friday. I presume then that Thursday evening’s party was still in full swing.The PM clearly impressed his new flunky, who described him as \"not a complete clown\". I’m not sure that statement would have earned Mr Harri another day in the job, or another day on Earth, had he said it of Henry VIII.John McArthur, Glasgow.Read more: Why Norway can never be a comparator for ScotlandSubscribe now for the latest opinion articles and letters from just £ for one month by clicking here"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-decision-queen-adopt-regnal-title-elizabeth-ii-reawakened-independence-movement","story":"The choiceto adopt the title Elizabeth the Second was controversial and seen as a signicant slight, not to say insult, to her northern kingdom, which had never before had an Elizabeth and could thus hardly have a Second. This helped to fuel republican sentiment and reawaken the independence movement – in the words of the Coronation Coronach, “Nae Liz the yin, nae Lillibet the twa, nae Liz will ever dae, and we’ll mak oor land republican in the Scottish breakaway”. Pillar boxes with the offending EIIR insignia were blown up by “Sky-high Joe” and the use of EIIR was dropped. As far as I am aware, this policy continues to the present day. Salt was rubbed into the wound in  when the name of the Clyde-built Q was revealed to be Queen Elizabeth the Second.

For example, why have a full catering facility on vessels with passage time of under one hour with all the attendant costs and requirement for crew accommodation  Why build a ferry for £ million when a suitable equivalent may be built in one-third of the cost in one-third of the time  Time for radical change and more careful husbandry of taxpayers money.J Patrick Maclean, Oban.DONT KNOCK SCOTTISH ACCENTI EMPATHISE totally with Amy Kinnairdand we should remember that the Scottish pronunciation of \"Standard English\" has a much closer relationship between spelling and sounds than most English speakers of English. I may get pelters for this, but for example the \"er\" sound at the end of words is often an \"a\" as in \"finga\", \"computa\", and so on. I taught English as a foreign language in three dferent areas in Spain and never encountered any problems with my Scottish accent – Ooviously modied and at a slower pace. The Scottish \"ch\" and our clear use of \"r\" helped their understanding. It also helped with my Spanish communication.So please, do not knock the Scottish language or any other non-Standard English accent. They all have a place to play in our increasingly erse nation. Language is about communication, as we are now seeing with increased interest in British Sign Language. We should also never forget that around  per cent of our communication is by body language. Just watch a Glaswegian giving directions to a stranger.Ian Smith, Symington.BEWARE OF STORM FRAUDSTERSMANY of us have suffered long power cuts, in my case  hours, and costs in the thousands of pounds to remove fallen trees and repairs to fencing not covered by insurance as a result of Storm Arwen.Many have, like me, welcomed the compensation from SSEN.

That is what the updated Strategic Framework will be aiming to support.\"Cases based on PCR and LFD combined have plateaued since mid-January Daily cases - based on PCR tests and self-reported positive lateral flow results - are now \"broadly stable\" at around - per day, while the number of patients in ICU with a recent positive Covid test has fallen to  - on a par with numbers seen last June.Infections in the under- age group - which were previously rising despite an overall decline - have fallen by more than a quarter in the past week. Ms Sturgeon added: \"The situation now remains much more positive than it was at the turn of the year - and thanks to a combination of vaccinations, targeted protective measures and the responsible reaction of the public, it is much more positive than we feared it might be at this stage.\"It seems reasonable based on the data to conclude that we are now through the worst of this wave of Omicron.\"ICU admissions and occupancy for Covid patients has fallen It comes as Scottish Conservatives set out their own agenda today in a Back to Normality policy paper, calling for an end to face masks in schools, further cuts to the self-isolation period, and the scrapping of mass contact tracing in favour of random sampling. : Blood pressure risk for patients taking paracetamol regularlyMs Sturgeon also confirmed that a total of  cases of the faster-spreading BA. Omicron subtype have now been detected in Scotland - up from  a week ago - although she cautioned that this will be a \"signicant underestimate\" since only a minority of cases are sequenced. The BA. strain can be distinguished from the main Omicron BA. iant currently in circulation in Scotland based on the presence of a marker known as the S-gene dropout: this shows up positive in BA. cases, but not in BA..In countries including Denmark and India, BA. has become the dominant form of Covid, and it is increasing in prevalence here too.: How worried should we be about the BA. Omicron iant \"In the past week there has been a further increase in the number of PCR test results showing positive for the S gene and a corresponding fall in the number which don’t have the S Gene,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\"This is likely to reflect an increase in BA. cases which, like Delta, are S Gene positive. In cases of the main Omicron iant, the S Gene is absent.\"Encouragingly, there remains no evidence at this stage that the disease caused by the BA. subtype is any more severe than that caused by the main Omicron iant.\"Nor does it appear to be any more capable of evading the immunity conferred by vaccination or prior infection.\"However there is evidence, from more than one country now, of a growth advantage for BA. compared to the main Omicron iant, which may mean it is more transmissible.\"All in all, however, there are no grounds at this stage for any signicant concern about BA. - and no reason to change our approach in response to it.

So, even them saying, ‘look, you can be dficult to manage’ I’ll take that on board.“I put them under a lot of pressure and I think the intensity and the physicality of the Scottish Premiership makes it a dficult league to referee in. With the pace of the game and the tackles flying in, it’s not an easy league to be an official.“So, I think just having a dialogue with one another, evenwe get one per cent out of it then we’re going to be better off.“The biggest one for me is your gestures. They say, ‘stop gesturing’, but how can you do that “Unless I’m doing an insulting gesture, throwing your hands in the air at a refereeing decision, how can I stop myself doing that “I’m not saying you do it for the fans but do you really want to be watching games of football where there’s no emotion and no gestures “I’ve seen fans questioning managers and saying, ‘he stands there with his hands in his pockets’. That’s definitely not me.“Opening dialogue with one another can’t make the situation any worse. I’m not saying it’s a terrible situation but it’s got to help the situation, surely.”Meanwhile, Jason Holt reckons Livingston are one of seven teams battling for the remaining top-six spots ahead of tonight’s trip to face Ross County in Dingwall.Martindale insists his side should still be concerned by the prospect of getting dragged into a relegation battle, but Holt reckons Saturday’s victory over Aberdeen is proof they are on the up.The Lions are just a point off Dundee United in sixth and four points shy of Motherwell in fourth after just three defeats from their last nine league games.The former Rangers and Hearts midfielder said: “The league is so tight right now and everyone can beat everyone . This season it’s so competitive.“There’s seven teams in there battling for the top-six and consistency will be the key going forward.“It was frustrating to lose to St Johnstone after beating Hibs at Easter Road.“We were high in confidence but we lost. But we managed to bounce back against Aberdeen and we showed a good reaction on Saturday.“It shows how far we have come when we are disappointed to take six points from nine in the last three games.“Since I have been here the squad has always been so strong and we have a good togetherness.“Those characteristics can take you a long way and we have to look to continue that for the rest of the season, and hopefully we can stay at the top end of the table.\""},{"url":null,"title":"glassford-street-first-buses-announce-diversions-glasgow-street-shut-8-days-filming","story":"Glasgow has been the scene of a superhero makeover in recent weeks with the set of Batgirl filming in ious locations across the city.Filming for other films such as Indiana Jones and The Batman have also occurred over the past year with the city raking in a record figure of £. million in film revenue.There is no sign of major movie productions stopping in Glasgow and the latest set will now see Glassford street shut for a period of eight days.The busy city centre road will be closed from Friday February  until Saturday February .First Buses have announced all of their timetable changes in the area on their website ahead of the closure.Information taken from Glasgow City Council’s website also suggests that more closures will take place in the city centre during the end of February and into the beginning of March on Hanover Street and George Square South.: Glasgow film festival is back with a bang - pick of the films⚠️ SERVICE UPDATE ⚠️Glassford StreetCity CentreTo allow for filming, on Friday th February : until Saturday th February : Glassford Street will be closed.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Butyou can play in this league you can play in all the leagues in the world.“The problem is when you stay in another league, you have to askyou can play in the Premier League. But when you play here, you can play in any league in the world.“Because the intensity, the quality, the physicality that you have here is not present in other leagues. For sure Romero is able to play in this league. This league is a perfect suit for him.“He’s an important player for me. He’s a new signing for me because he played the first game with me, only one game in the league. vw,vw,px, px\"Cristian Romero joined the club from Atalanta in the summer “He’s strong physically, he has the timing to anticipate, good personality to play with the ball. Despite being a young player he has good experience, he’s strong. And I like him. For sure, he has a lot of space for improvement.”With Romero at the back and Harry Kane spearheading the attack, Spurs have a decent spine that could propel them towards their goals in the second half of the season.Kane’s season has come to le under Conte and the Italian has vowed to make him even better.The England captain was ineffective under Nuno Espirito Santo as he had to come and find the ball and his attacking threat vanished as a result.But Conte says playing Kane as a number nine is the key.“For sure, for sure it is not simple. It is not easy to improve a player of this level,” Conte said.“At the same time I think that Harry is improving a lot in his position because I think in this moment with us he is playing much more like number nine.“In the past I have seen him a lot, often to go outside and I think that Harry into the box… he is very good outside because he’s also a number  and he has this quality to pass the ball and to make an assist but at the same time to kickand to score.“But I think that he has improved a lot in his position to be also a number nine, a strong number nine and I think he is improving a lot in the duels with his opponent, to defend the ball and in my opinion he is becoming a complete player,  per cent.“He is a player that in this moment he can play in every team of the world and to be the striker.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

mountain hares per square kilometre.“This is similar to the densities recently recorded in their core range in Scotland and between two to five times higher than the most recent estimates at other sites in the national park.”And he said: “The threats of traffic accidents, the isolation of the Peak District population, disease and climate change remain, but this survey is welcome news for the species.“Although we only have data from one year of surveys so far, the adoption of this new methodology in the Peak District is a breakthrough for the population, and it is our hope this survey continues to help conservation efforts in the future.”Dr Hesford said the first year of surveying had delivered “very much preliminary results”, but it will inform long-term monitoring that will help with their conservation.There was previously limited data on the population in the Peak District, drawn from other areas which are not managed as grouse moors.Dr Hesford suggested the higher population density found in the latest survey is likely to be partly due to the more effective method of counting and partly due to the way in which the sites being analysed are managed.The GWCT said mountain hares benefit from the conditions grouse moor keepers maintain for boosting numbers of red grouse, such as heather burning that produces new young shoots which they eat, and control of predators such as foxes and stoats.\" data-title\"Snow in the Peak District, home to Englands only population of mountain hares \" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"Danny Lawson\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production baabdfeabfebfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNDAxMTI ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production baabdfeabfebfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNDAxMTI ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production baabdfeabfebfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNDAxMTI ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Snow in the Peak District, home to England’s only population of mountain hares In Scotland, unlicensed killing of mountain hares has been banned, while in England the species can be managed through shooting but the population must be maintained in a favourable conservation status.Climate change threatens the mountain hares by creating a mismatch between the periods when they have their white winter coat camouflage and when there is snow cover on the ground.A shorter snowy period in winter means the white hares stand out on the brown and green ground, making them easy prey for predators.“Because of the way in which grouse moors are managed, even in the face of climate change it’s likely these areas – provided they are managed in the same way – will provide habitat for mountain hares,” Dr Hesford said.Richard Bailey, Peak District Moorland Group co-ordinator who helped arrange the surveys, said: “Mountain hares are predominantly nocturnal animals, so it makes sense that the night-time counts are providing more successful and reliable population estimates than daytime counting.“This population of mountain hares has survived thanks to the habitat management and predator control undertaken by gamekeepers in the Dark Peak area.“This research confirms that the hard work is still benefiting the species.”Wildle groups have criticised grouse moor estates for heather burning which, they say, damages the habitat and carbon storage, and amid concerns over the illegal killing of hen harriers which prey on grouse chicks.But estate owners say they are undertaking action for wildle conservation and preventing wildfires, have zero tolerance to illegal persecution of birds of prey, and the shoots provide rural jobs and economic benefits.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times.Here in Norway toll roads is common to finance such projects#get the funding from the Scottish Gov and get on with it.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

I would simply urge to the court that it is already causing a huge amount of anxiety, for reasons previously stated, and the sooner this process can be completed the better for all concerned.Ms Campbell said the quality of the material she has received from the PSNI is a constant source of concern, with some information illegible and not photocopied properly.I would press to the court again thatwe could have material in a legible format it would take a lot of heat out of the disclosure process, she said.Ms Campbell added: So far as we#re concerned, in terms of identying a date, from Noah#s mother#s perspective it is much more important to have everything completed, and comprehensively completed, in advance of the inquest.We are in no rush towards a date, from that perspective, but equally, knowing the pressures on the system, and indeed on all parties, to find a date - really the sooner the better.

Now, how many planes, how many trucks, how many cars are coming in from Great Britain to Northern Ireland every day “And the EU are demanding that we go in and ask people to open their suitcases, to open their bags, andthere’s a few mandarin oranges that they bought for the children on the way home on the ferry, that’s an at-risk item.”Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson won’t be visiting Northern Ireland imminently, following calls from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to do so amid the political crisis.Downing Street said Mr Johnson was monitoring the situation at Stormont closely, but there were no plans for the PM to travel over.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinNorthern Ireland AssemblySDLPNI ProtocolPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillTraditional Unionist VoiceEdwin PootsBoris JohnsonMore On Ulster Unionist PartyBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleStormont crisis: We must salvage what we can from the chaos caused by reckless DUP, says Michelle O#Neill PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumGrassroots unionists back my calls: DonaldsonMost ReadEight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police OmbudsmanLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Loyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’ under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsLatest Northern IrelandPolice launch murder investigation following death of man after assaultSnow Patrol’s Johnny McDaid presents Brit award alongside Courtney CoxNewry man lured to scene and shot in the legs is known to policeLaw to close ‘bedroom tax loopholes’ passes final hurdle in AssemblyBird flu confirmed in backyard Fermanagh flockLatestMurder investigation opened after death in Greenwich under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backAdele hails female artists as she accepts gender-neutral gong at BritsEddie Howe warns players to stay grounded as Newcastle climb out of drop zonePolice launch murder investigation following death of man after assault,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press EyeFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailJust a few weeks ago, the Executive announced the relaxation of a raft of Covid- safety measures and promised more were on the way.Describing his delight at the development, former First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped the Executive would be in a position to review remaining restrictions this Thursday.Read MoreRobin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reform“The February  date will be an important meeting now for those outstanding measures that are still in place,” he said. In particular, he said he wanted to see the removal of the controversial Covid certicate scheme: “The DUP has been opposed to its introduction, today we’ve made big progress in reducing its application and I want to see further progress.”Throughout the pandemic, a number of DUP members have been high-profile opponents to many of the Covid restrictions — think Sammy Wilson describing face coverings as muzzles and Paul Frew leading the charge against offering vaccinations to children and mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers.DUP politicians have increasingly raised concerns about the effects of restrictions on the economy, apparently keen to lt the measures as soon as possible.However, following Mr Givan’s resignation, it has been left to Robin Swann to find a way to lt remaining restrictions as hospitalisations and deaths linked to the virus begin to drop.Despite all its previous posturing about the damage being caused by the Covid restrictions, it appears the fight to rid Northern Ireland of the Protocol is the priority for the DUP.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result, Mr Swann, like all remaining ministers, is having to navigate a unique environment at Stormont. Firstly, he has to ascertain whether he can remove restrictions without the collective support of the Executive.Then,he gets the green light, it has to be established how this can be achieved. But the headache doesn’t stop there — as Mr Swann pointed out on Monday, Northern Ireland is finally moving out of the latest Covid- surge. With fewer people requiring hospital treatment for a Covid infection, it seemed like NI was inching closer to the point where it could begin the long and onerous task of rebuilding our decimated health service.So, last week’s decision by the DUP to remove Mr Givan from his post has been a hammer blow to the thousands of NHS staff crippled by the ravages of the pandemic and the hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hospital treatment.When Mr Swann on Monday said “our health service urgently needs an end to political point scoring”, he was absolutely right.An inclination to put votes before support for much-needed reform has already caused untold damage to the health service, while waiting lists spiralled after the Assembly collapsed in .Mr Swann had the unenviable task of tackling the issue and he admitted on Monday that it was going to be a signicant challenge. Yet now he is not only in a position where he will be solely responsible for bringing to an end Covid restrictions so detested by many, but, as hundreds of thousands of people languish on hospital waiting lists, he will be able to blame the current political instability for their suffering too.Related topicsRobin SwannThe Executive OfficePaul GivanUlster Unionist PartyPaul FrewMore On Robin SwannRobin Swann speaks of own child’s heart condition while declaring organ donation bill ‘Daithi’s Law’Signicant danger from Covid- over ‘to a degree’, claims senior Northern Ireland medic PremiumViewpointOpinionNorthern Ireland’s health at risk after broken vowsCovid-: what are the remaining restrictions in Northern Ireland Robin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reformMost ReadEight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police OmbudsmanLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Loyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’ under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsLatest Northern IrelandPolice launch murder investigation following death of man after assaultSnow Patrol’s Johnny McDaid presents Brit award alongside Courtney CoxNewry man lured to scene and shot in the legs is known to policeLaw to close ‘bedroom tax loopholes’ passes final hurdle in AssemblyBird flu confirmed in backyard Fermanagh flockLatestMurder investigation opened after death in Greenwich under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backAdele hails female artists as she accepts gender-neutral gong at BritsEddie Howe warns players to stay grounded as Newcastle climb out of drop zonePolice launch murder investigation following death of man after assault,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help.

Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday. His son, Neville, still has horses in training.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityInitial results of a count using a methodology developed in Scotland indicate the population densities of the hares are between two and five times higher than recent data drawn from other sites in the national park.The Game and Wildle Conservation Trustwhich led the research, said the findings are “welcome news” for the species – though they still face many threats including climate change.Mountain hares are native to Scotland and died out in England during the last Ice Age.But they were introduced into the English uplands in the mid-s by shooting estates, surviving now only in the Peak District.The counting method, developed in Scotland by GWCT with the James Hutton Institute and NatureScot as a more reliable technique for counting hare numbers than previously used, involves recording numbers of hares seen along regular transects through the landscape at night.It was undertaken by the Peak District Moorland Group, part of the Moorland Association, with gamekeepers counting hares across  grouse moor estates in the Dark Peak area of the national park.Lead author of the study Dr Nick Hesford, from the GWCT, said: “Preliminary results suggest that the numbers of hares recorded by gamekeepers may be equivalent to a population density of around - mountain hares per square kilometre.“This is similar to the densities recently recorded in their core range in Scotland and between two to five times higher than the most recent estimates at other sites in the national park.”And he said: “The threats of traffic accidents, the isolation of the Peak District population, disease and climate change remain, but this survey is welcome news for the species.“Although we only have data from one year of surveys so far, the adoption of this new methodology in the Peak District is a breakthrough for the population, and it is our hope this survey continues to help conservation efforts in the future.”.removeDr Hesford said the first year of surveying had delivered “very much preliminary results”, but it will inform long-term monitoring that will help with their conservation.There was previously limited data on the population in the Peak District, drawn from other areas which are not managed as grouse moors.Dr Hesford suggested the higher population density found in the latest survey is likely to be partly due to the more effective method of counting and partly due to the way in which the sites being analysed are managed.The GWCT said mountain hares benefit from the conditions grouse moor keepers maintain for boosting numbers of red grouse, such as heather burning that produces new young shoots which they eat, and control of predators such as foxes and stoats.\" data-title\"Snow in the Peak District, home to Englands only population of mountain hares \" data--holder\"PA Archive\" data--notice\"PA Archive PA Images\" data-credit\"Danny Lawson\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production baabdfeabfebfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNDAxMTI ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production baabdfeabfebfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNDAxMTI ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production baabdfeabfebfYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQNDAxMTI ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Snow in the Peak District, home to England’s only population of mountain hares In Scotland, unlicensed killing of mountain hares has been banned, while in England the species can be managed through shooting but the population must be maintained in a favourable conservation status.Climate change threatens the mountain hares by creating a mismatch between the periods when they have their white winter coat camouflage and when there is snow cover on the ground.A shorter snowy period in winter means the white hares stand out on the brown and green ground, making them easy prey for predators.“Because of the way in which grouse moors are managed, even in the face of climate change it’s likely these areas – provided they are managed in the same way – will provide habitat for mountain hares,” Dr Hesford said.Richard Bailey, Peak District Moorland Group co-ordinator who helped arrange the surveys, said: “Mountain hares are predominantly nocturnal animals, so it makes sense that the night-time counts are providing more successful and reliable population estimates than daytime counting.“This population of mountain hares has survived thanks to the habitat management and predator control undertaken by gamekeepers in the Dark Peak area.“This research confirms that the hard work is still benefiting the species.”Wildle groups have criticised grouse moor estates for heather burning which, they say, damages the habitat and carbon storage, and amid concerns over the illegal killing of hen harriers which prey on grouse chicks.But estate owners say they are undertaking action for wildle conservation and preventing wildfires, have zero tolerance to illegal persecution of birds of prey, and the shoots provide rural jobs and economic benefits..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Mountain hare populations in Peak District higher than thought, count suggests article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

Alan MIllarBasically, He was telling them that they were the means whereby the world would be flavoured by God’s love, grace, mercy, compassion, kindness, and forgiveness. In other words, they were to be just like Him. That is how they would add flavour to the lives of people with whom they shared the gospel. The fruits of the spirit, according to the apostle Paul, emanates from God’s love, which we read about in  Corinthians :-b, where he explains how the love of God affects us, and others. First, he tells us that love ‘is patient, love is kind’. Then he tells us what it is not – ‘it is not proud, boastful, doesn’t lie’, and much, much more. What Paul is describing is God’s pure love and it is that kind of love we are to show to the world, to add flavour to the lives of others, to be the salt of the earth. But its preserving qualities are perhaps what the church is all about, because the soul of mankind is rotting through sin and depravity. The quality of salt, spiritually speaking, can ensure that the corruption of the world does not contaminate the church, and the church, while it remains, ensures that society will not decay until Christ comes again. Christians, as the salt of the earth, are vitally important in God’s plans for mankind’s redemption. May all who follow Christ be salt in our homes, communities, places of work, wherever we meet others, and let others taste and see that the Lord is good.Jesus  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...NewsDual language street sign request fails...NewsWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsMost PopularHow to choose a dining table, and our favourite dining table...RecommendedSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...Recommended Valentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...RecommendedBuying a Nintendo Switch for your household  Our guide on ho...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In addition, I learnt on my very first business conference I attended in London over  years ago when I speak I am doing so through the filters of my understanding, and you hear it through the filters of your understanding. Adam Harbinson.Maybe not a great example, but I heard a very funny story the other day, which demonstrates. Old Jimmy overheard a conversation between a young couple as they dined in a restaurant. The man gazed lovingly into the young lady and said, ‘Darling, when I look into your eyes, time stands still’. Well, Jimmy thought that would really impress his Maggie, so later that evening as they feasted on a hastily purchased fish supper, he decided to repeat what he had heard the young man say, and so he looked into Maggie’s bloodshot eyes and whispered:‘Maggie, your face would stop a clock’.Like me, Jimmy knew exactly what he meant, but in the words of the Jim Croce song, ‘Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong...’There’s a much misunderstood quotation in the New Testament where Jesus gave his disciples a ‘new commandment’. It was not another commandment, but properly understood it was to replace all the other  that had morphed out of Moses’ . He said, ‘I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other, just as I have loved you.’So how do we love each other  Is it just by words that can be so easily misunderstood  I don’t think so, I like to think of the word ‘love’ as a verb and not a noun, it’s an action word, reminiscent of the words attributed to Francis of Assisi. ‘Preach at all times, andyou have to, use words’.Actions always speak louder.Read More Read MoreRead more newsJesusLondon  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...NewsDual language street sign request fails...NewsWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsMost PopularHow to choose a dining table, and our favourite dining table...RecommendedSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...Recommended Valentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...RecommendedBuying a Nintendo Switch for your household  Our guide on ho...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back.
