One top forecasting firm projects that revenue from the creative industries will drop by an astonishing £74billion in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus lockdown. More than 400,000 jobs will be lost by year\u0027s end - simply a human tragedy - and the damage doesn\u0027t stop there. Countless more millions in revenue will be lost to the bars and restaurants that complement theatres and concert halls around the country. At the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, we earn 91 per cent of our annual turnover and take only a 9 per cent government subsidy. At a stroke, all our income except that small subsidy has been lost. Many regional theatres have a reputation for developing acting and writing talent. In Plymouth, I gave Michael Sheen his first directing job at our Drum theatre, while David Suchet and Ben Whishaw have also performed there and James Corden, Michael Ball - a Plymouth lad - and Sir Ian McKellen have played our Lyric stage.  It is a virtuous circle of British creative talent that now circulates around Hollywood and the globe. Now all of that is threatened. South Korea shows us what can be done. It may surprise some to learn that Phantom of the Opera is currently playing in Seoul to packed houses. Cast and patrons have their temperatures taken and apply sanitising gel. Masks are worn. But people sit side by side, with no social distancing. At the beginning of the reopening, only half those Koreans with booked seats were prepared to attend. But after a dozen or so performances, the figure shot up to above 90 per cent. This is the sort of bold thinking that will be necessary to save our industry. Large-scale theatres require attendances of 70 to 80 per cent to break even, so social distancing, even at one metre, is a non-starter. In the immediate term, we need a financial support scheme for the whole sector. But equally important is political leadership. The Prime Minister and his scientific advisers must get behind a new regime that will allow theatres to open again. We need to get back to the business of safely delighting people. Adrian Vinken is chief executive of the Theatre Royal, PlymouthTimes letters: Arts still in peril after the lockdown lifts | Comment | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard called Elon Musk Rocketman texts","story":"Share this articleShare this articleAmber Heard called Elon Musk her \u0027Rocketman\u0027 in texts while married to Johnny Depp - Mirror OnlineElon Musk denies threesome with Amber Heard and Cara Delevingne"},{"url":null,"title":"Massive cargo ship runs aground trying enter mouth Aberdeen harbour","story":"Share this articleVIDEO: Joint investigation launched after cargo ship runs aground entering Aberdeen Harbour | Press and Journal"},{"url":null,"title":"Romanian widower 27 British vicar 81 says ready collect 150 000 life insurance","story":"Share this articleRomanian toyboy, 27, says he wants to find \u0027new love\u0027 as he bars family of his Brit ex-vicar husband, 81, from cremation"},{"url":null,"title":"Black Lives Matter leader Hawk Newsome says change doesnt happen burn system","story":"Share this articleBlack Lives Matter leader states if US \u0027doesn\u0027t give us what we want, then we will burn down this system\u0027 | Fox News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54ed507203aabe0b98e339d917da33deed420fe/43_81_2915_1749/master/2915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb19a41fc94e32a182f340d362d7234","title":"prince parade cherry moon jeff katz best photograph","story":"‘I took this on the Cote d’Azur where he was filming Under the Cherry Moon surrounded by megastars. He put some music on and said he was good to go. I didn’t have time to be nervous’Early in the autumn of 1985, Prince’s assistant called me and said: “Prince would like you to come to France to be his personal photographer for the new film he’s making.” I packed my bags and jumped on a plane the next day to Studio La Victorine on the French Riviera, to document the filming of Under the Cherry Moon, Prince’s directorial debut. I was only 25 at the time. To this day, I think it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever done.It wasn’t my first time working with Prince. A few months earlier, Warner Brothers asked me to help him put together the album artwork for some of the smaller bands he was working with. I was mostly shooting his proteges – not Prince himself – but we got to know each other and I learned what he liked.I had shot a few concerts, some bands, but no real celebrities. Then there I was, in the Cote d’Azur, surrounded by megastars. Warner Brothers had assembled the most star-studded crew you could think of: Academy award winners, the best cinematographers in the world, the best set designers – everybody you could imagine was there.I arrived a week before filming got under way and I was in awe. Being in this place where Truffaut had made a number of his films with some of the leading lights of cinema felt like I was witnessing something legendary.There were some technical things like locations and lighting and sets that were still being worked out, so I thought I’d have time to soak it in. I soon learned that Prince didn’t like his time to be idle. He was constantly at work, whether it was playing, recording, shooting a music video or a photo session. In the first week, his assistant announced that the formal photo shoot would take place that day. Two hours later, I was shooting Prince.I didn’t have time to be nervous. The focus that kicked in was what I imagine people who do extreme sports feel. You know if you falter for even a second you will fail. So I focused, intently, and made sure I got what I needed.He led me towards a huge soundstage and we decided to keep things simple: I set up a white background with some unfussy lighting. I was fascinated by stripped-back portraiture at the time so I knew I wanted an image with nothing getting in the way. Prince let hair and makeup fuss over him, and then sent them all out of the room when he was ready. He put some music on a small boombox, and told me he was good to go. Within three rolls of film, I knew I had the shot.I captured exactly what I set out to achieve: something simple, dramatic and iconic. The way the delicacy of his face offsets the muscularity of his stomach and the drama of his hand gestures makes this photo special for me. It ended up on the cover of his album Parade.It was the start of more than a decade photographing Prince. I’ve worked with people of immense talent throughout my career, but nobody compares to him. Prince was Prince from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to sleep: he was meticulous in his art at every moment. Not once did I see him lose his temper or cause a scene, and working with him over such a long time frame allowed me to witness him in so many different iterations. Every year would herald a whole new reinvention, both in his aesthetic and his sound.We parted ways in 1996. It was an amicable split. I didn’t hear from him for years, but we caught up in the early 2010s about making new work. Then, inevitably, he got swept on to a different project, and we never had chance to reconnect after that.When I heard the news of his passing, I didn’t believe it. It sounds absurd, but I just didn’t believe he would die. The man was so endlessly creative that it was impossible to imagine his death. I spent 11 years of my life photographing him. Now, I hope my archive captures something of his inimitable creativity.• Limited-edition prints from Jeff Katz’s archive of Prince are available from his website, princebyjeffkatz.Trained: BA in film and cinema, Ithaca College, New York State.High point: “Being able to do what I love every day.”Low point: “The death of film.”Top tip: “Slow down, think more about your shot, and make something that makes people stop scrolling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ca6b3b594fdbca56109b923a9e4e5954ca1c8a/0_320_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ec5fc8cee6d27981a043504c67df9d","title":"splendid isolation in search of scotlands hermits","story":"Many isolated people have struggled in lockdown, but others enjoy solitude and choose it as a way of life. Here, Elliot Caunce portrays four modern hermits who live off the grid in ScotlandWilliams, 70, moved into his off-grid farmhouse in the 70s, with his then wife and his daughter, Ceilidh, after falling out with his landlord in Aberdeen. When the marriage ended, he stayed on alone, but he is philosophically optimistic about a future relationship: “I was once married and I may well be married again. It’s a big house to be rattling around in by myself.”Down a remote forestry track in Aberdeenshire, his house has no mains electricity, water or conventional sewage system. For a hermit, he is not averse to fame: he featured in the cinema documentary Two Years At Sea by Ben Rivers, appeared on a Frankie Boyle television show and plays folk music at open mic nights.Maitland, 70, is a successful author who writes books about religious fantasy and solitude, informed by her Roman Catholic faith. She spent increasing amounts of time alone when her marriage broke down in 1993. “I went to live in the country. It was here I started to practise solitude and it grew from there. I found I loved it.” She has lived in the remote moorlands of Galloway since 2006.She recognises that living alone in remote countryside could become difficult as she gets older, especially if she becomes unable to drive. She needs a car to fetch supplies and to remove rubbish, as there is no bin collection.McDonald, 65, moved into a tent in 2007, after he was diagnosed with a critical heart condition and told he needed a transplant. He decided to self-isolate on the edge of a loch, to the east of Fort William. “I thought: if I’ve only got a short life expectancy, I’m just going to come out and live in the wild, which is what I was going to do when I retired.” Living in an area without a phone signal or roads, and few hikers, he has become resilient and self-sufficient. Shopping for supplies involves a round trip of 10 miles walking and 50 miles by train.Smith, 74, is known as the Hermit of Loch Treig. He has lived alone in an isolated log cabin, lacking all modern amenities, since 1984. Once a month, he hikes along an active train track to his nearest station, then takes an hour’s ride to Fort William for food and medical supplies. His one concession to modern life is an emergency locator beacon, which he activated in February 2019 after becoming ill – the distress signal was routed via Houston, Texas, to the coastguard and then Lochaber Mountain Rescue he was airlifted to hospital by helicopter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/782f474623b6dcc280562e0b6a7da5adca3e315f/0_14_4680_2808/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b1c49ef46a2a05b4dd7cccb56014502","title":"david levenes glastonbury highlights buy a guardian print","story":"From Bono to a bare stage...  photographer David Levene talks through his favourite Glastonbury shots"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79327102799f75902687dd77d4d65db4c4f2cce/0_0_2953_2914/master/2953.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=819034f8baf03825b2f6b3b8af2338cb 700w","title":"center parcs to reopen on 13 july in uk and ireland but pools stay closed","story":"Fewer holidaymakers allowed and activities changed because of physical distancingCenter Parcs is to reopen its UK and Irish holiday “villages” on 13 July – but its pools and spas will stay closed.The company, which shut its five UK centres on 20 March ahead of the coronavirus lockdown, said it would allow visitors to cancel new and existing bookings up to six days before arrival and receive a full refund, as it recognised some would want to reschedule because of changes to its facilities.As well as the closure of pools and spas, Center Parcs said there would be a reduced number of holidaymakers at each venue, changes to some activities to ensure physical distancing in line with government guidelines, extra cleaning and a new takeaway service.Martin Dalby, the chief executive, said: “We know how disappointing it will be for some families that the subtropical swimming paradise isn’t open during their break. We have been planning the changes needed to maintain social distancing and we look forward to reopening these facilities as soon as we are able. However, we know that so many families have been looking forward to their breaks and we are so pleased to be open for the summer.”The company said it was beginning to bring back its 8,500 employees from furlough and train them in new ways of working and safety procedures ahead of reopening.Center Parcs will reopen more than a week after hospitality venues were given the green light to get back to business. Hotels, bed and breakfasts, holiday homes, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be able to open in England from 4 July. Campsites will be given guidance on shared areas such as shower, toilet and washing-up facilities.British businesses are expected to enjoy a boom in trade from staycations over the remains of the summer, as fears about flying abroad as well as quarantine rules put a dampener on overseas trips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226ba1c41caf79e5c89007ef55bc6f57207aafd1/0_467_2492_1495/master/2492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46847a4e0974d7fa62d215b405cb9bde","title":"arctic heatwave 38c siberia science","story":"It’s 38C in Siberia. The science may be complicated – but the need for action now couldn’t be clearerThere’s an Arctic heatwave: it’s 38C in Siberia. Arctic sea ice is the second lowest on record, and 2020 may be on course to be the hottest year since records began.For many people, such news induces a lurch of fear, or avoidance – closing the webpage because they don’t want to hear yet more bad news. A few might think “It’s just weather,” and roll their eyes.How can we make sense of such an event? Climate is subtle and shifting, with many drivers and timescales. But we can use this northern heatwave to illuminate the complexity of our planet. We can break this question into parts, from fast to slow.Fast: the immediate effect is to increase wildfires. Siberia has seen “zombie fires” reignited from deep smouldering embers in peatland. This is bad news, releasing particulate air pollution and more carbon in 18 months than in the past 16 years. The immediate cause? Here in the mid-high northern latitudes, we live in unstable weather under the influence of the polar jet stream. This rapid current of air high above our heads drags weather in a conveyor belt from west to east, with alternating patches of cold and warm air, low and high pressure. Sometimes the weather patterns get stuck, creating a stable period of weather, like a heatwave. This is one long, severe example.Does climate breakdown make this “blocking” more likely? Maybe. The jet stream is created by the contrast between cold polar air and the warmer south. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average: that means less north-south contrast, so the jet stream can become more wobbly and meandering. Loops break off like the oxbow lakes of school geography lessons, stranding particular weather patterns in one place.And why is the Arctic warming faster? Because sea ice and snow are so bright. When they melt with global warming, the ocean and land beneath are darker, so they absorb more of the sun’s heat. Their loss amplifies our warming.The current low in Arctic sea ice is itself partly the result of the Siberian heatwave, amplifying the usual year-to-year fluctuations. But the trend is down: the more CO2 we emit, the more the planet’s temperature rises, and the more sea ice we lose. Scientists predict the Arctic will start seeing summers without sea ice by 2050.But it’s not irreversible. It’s not a tipping point. The sea ice would return if we could cool the climate again. Unfortunately we know only three ways to do that: extract vast amounts of CO2 from the air with trees or technology reflect the sun’s rays at a planetary scale or wait, for many generations.This Arctic heatwave is a sharp spike on top of the global warming trend. That’s what makes it more intense, more likely and more of a warning: it’s a taste of the future predicted for Russia, if we burn quickly through our fossil fuels.The real fear around the Arctic for the longer term, I find when talking to people, comes from the idea of “runaway” warming from methane release. Warming could release stores of methane – a strong greenhouse gas – from permafrost or frozen sediments at the bottom of the ocean, which would add to the warming from our own activities. There is more than twice the amount of carbon in the permafrost as in the atmosphere, and thawing has already begun.There are big local impacts – damage to roads and buildings, because the ground can no longer bear so much weight, and an appalling story involving what appears to be anthrax release from thawing burial grounds. Permafrost thaw was even blamed by a Russian mining company for the recent collapse of a fuel reservoir, contaminating the river with 20,000 tonnes of diesel, though other factors were probably also involved.So could this Siberian heatwave, or ones like it, trigger catastrophic warming? I see much fear about amplifying methane feedbacks, including the false idea that climate scientists don’t consider them (we do, just separately to the main global climate models). Yet for several years there has been growing evidence that this risk is less than originally thought. Carbon stored in permafrost and wetlands is predicted to contribute around 100bn tonnes of CO2 this century. That’s a lot, but we add around 40bn tonnes ourselves every year. The methane at the bottom of the ocean would take centuries to release, so as long as we limit global warming we should keep those stores mostly locked up. There are uncertainties, of course, but the stores’ impact on warming is likely to be tenths of a degree, not several degrees.Yet every tonne of CO2 released from permafrost means one tonne fewer we can emit if we are to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Every year’s equivalent of our emissions brings our deadline closer. Every tenth of a degree of warming brings us closer to our target of 1.5°C and makes more permafrost thaw, and the impacts of climate breakdown worse for the most vulnerable people and species of the world.The Arctic heatwave shows us that there are few simple stories in climate change. There is always a mix of natural and human influence, bad news and slightly-less-bad news, and occasionally even hopeful news. So, more than ever, we need to avoid over-simplifying or slipping into easy tropes like “We’re all doomed” or “It’s all weather,” but to try to understand the details. Perhaps there is one simple story though: every bit of warming we avoid will help keep our planet a more familiar and an easier place to live on.• Dr Tamsin Edwards is a senior lecturer in physical geography at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fed2f726fc05096ebe176c186145f6ee8bbb9fa/0_353_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=01229469369e60826b9446f863847414","title":"the guardian view on covid 19 and climate leadership required","story":"Government advisers have set a course through the pandemic to net zero. Is Boris Johnson capable of following it?The colossal challenge facing human civilisation, of ending our reliance on fossil fuels in short order, has almost certainly been made harder by the pandemic. Ever since scientists discovered that the Earth was warming as a result of human activity, it has been a struggle to get people, governments and businesses to do anything about it. Even in those countries least resistant to the evidence of rapidly approaching danger, something else was usually seen as more important. In the past few months, once again, the climate emergency has been knocked off the top of world leaders’ to-do list by the more immediate threat of the virus.Recognising this, the environmental movement came up with the excellent idea of a green recovery. The annual report published on Thursday by the Committee on Climate Change, which provides official advice to the UK government, is a crucial, national component of that global effort. It sets out to tell Boris Johnson, his ministers and the British public how we can embed the lessons of Covid-19 in the next phase of carbon cuts.To what extent the overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be sustained, either domestically or internationally, will depend on the policies pursued. The committee identifies post-pandemic stimulus spending on high-carbon infrastructure as a threat. Changing attitudes to public transport due to the risk of infection is another. On the other hand, the kind of transformation that will be required if we are to become a zero-carbon world has arguably been made easier by the pandemic. Once people see how fragile and interconnected we really are, pressure for rapid decarbonisation could be expected to grow.Beyond such practical indications of where action is needed, and highlighting of inconsistencies in areas from agriculture to aviation, the report makes a case for “fairness as a core principle”. This applies domestically, and requires ministers to think about the differential impact of any changes – for example to energy taxes. But it also has global implications, and entails a new way of counting emissions that includes consumption as well as production.Sound advice is one thing. The capacity to take it is another. Boris Johnson has only chaired one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change set up last October. This fact on its own is dismal. But the opportunity remains. Next week he is expected to set out how the UK government will approach the recovery. Preparations for the postponed Cop26 climate talks are the ideal way to make this a global discussion. Can Mr Johnson show more effective leadership in the climate crisis than he has during the pandemic? For the UK in 2020 there are few more important questions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c206d4e3b22f67cea766fd63ea822d2f65121dd8/0_256_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=852dfa01fd4cfe57a875d4260e730ff4","title":"the guardian view on polands election pride versus prejudice","story":"A disgracefully homophobic campaign may have backfired on President Andrzej DudaLast week, in Poland’s presidential palace, the incumbent head of state, Andrzej Duda, was presented with a set of grim photographic portraits. The images were of Polish LGBT teenagers who had recently taken their own lives. The activist who presented President Duda with the images said after the meeting: “I told him I hope he will see these kids in his nightmares.”The tone of bitter exasperation was understandable. In the lead-up to Poland’s delayed presidential election this Sunday, the disgraceful drumbeat of homophobia in Mr Duda’s bid for re-election has been unrelenting and shameful. During a televised debate on LGBT issues, an MP from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) and member of the president’s campaign team told viewers: “Let’s stop listening to these idiocies about human rights. These people are not equal with normal people.” The president himself has pledged to “defend children from LGBT ideology”, an alleged worldview that he compared to communism in its power to destroy Polish values.With wearying predictability, Poland’s populist right tends to ramp up its culture wars when election time comes around. Muslim migrants have previously found themselves depicted by PiS as the enemy within. The rhetoric is cynical and manipulative, intended to mobilise a deeply conservative, mostly rural base. But the licence given in recent years to extreme prejudice has steadily changed the reality of LGBT lives on the ground. Around eighty municipal and local governments, covering great swaths of Polish territory, have declared themselves “free from LGBT ideology”. Pride marches have been attacked and banned. The 48-year-old Mr Duda, a devout Catholic, has promised to ban LGBT education in schools and refused to allow same-sex marriage.As election day nears, however, there are heartening signs that the old polarising playbook may be misfiring. During the country’s Covid-19 lockdown, when Mr Duda was well ahead in the polls, the government unsuccessfully tried to rush the poll through by postal vote. But the subsequent entry into the race of Warsaw’s liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, has spooked the president’s team. Despite relentless attacks from state media, it seems that Mr Trzaskowski may do well enough to force a second round run-off on 12 July. At that point, polls suggest, opposition supporters would unite and all bets would be off.Unexpectedly then, Europe’s first major election since the Covid-19 pandemic struck could prove a turning point. Poland has become a civil rights outlier in the EU, but a defeat for Mr Duda would be the most serious reverse for the populist right since he became president in 2015. The presidency’s veto powers would allow Mr Trzaskowski to block PiS’s legislative agenda, including controversial judicial reforms.Mr Duda will hope that praise and support from Donald Trump, during a visit to Washington this week, will consolidate mainstream support in a fiercely pro-American country. But eyeing the narrowing polls, some of Mr Duda’s supporters fear that, for once, aggressive and isive rhetoric against minorities may have backfired. For Poland’s shamefully ostracised LGBT community, that would be a cause for celebration and relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

It has been in the museum collection since 1802 and is regularly named as the number one object people want to see.But the museum argues another character deserves his place in the story too: William John Bankes, a charming, adventurous and rich Egyptologist who was forced to flee Britain after he was caught having sex in Green Park with a soldier.Because of Bankes, the Rosetta Stone is being added to LGBTQ+ themed tours of the British Museum which began last year and have become hugely popular, said Stuart Frost, the museum’s head of interpretation and volunteers.“The first run of tours was booked out within an hour or two, demand was really high, volunteers enjoy doing them and we’ve had great feedback from the public,” he said.Frost sees them as a good vehicle for sharing new research with the public. “Sometimes it is new stories, sometimes it is highlighting stories which are just not very well known because historically they have been overlooked.”For that reason about 20 objects are being added to the tours, including the Rosetta Stone.The tours have stemmed from a gay history book written by Richard Parkinson, a former British Museum curator who was in charge of the stone for many years. He argues that “every object is potentially queer” and that it just takes some scratching of the surface to find connections.Frost said most people would not know “that a gay man was instrumental in making the Rosetta Stone one of the most famous historical objects in the world”.The actual text on the Rosetta Stone is strikingly dry: priests asking for a tax break. But its importance is immeasurable because it says the same thing in three different scripts, which allowed the early scholars to crack the code of hieroglyphics.Champollion and Young are rightly famous because of it. But the museum says it was Bankes who discussed the possibility that the texts on the stone might all say the same thing, and he correctly supposed that a recurring cartouche represented a royal name. An obelisk collected by Bankes and which stands in the grounds of Kingston Lacy, his lavish Dorset home, was used in deciphering the stone.Bankes remains a fascinating character. Described by his friend Lord Byron as the “father of all mischief”, he was forced to flee Britain in 1841 when, in his mid-50s, he was charged with “unnatural offences”. Because it was the second time he had been caught, execution was a real possibility.Other new objects on the tours will include an ancient Greek coin depicting the poet Sappho and a Roman lamp showing two women having oral sex, probably representing a male fantasy.There is also a 1777 medal of the Chevalier d’Eon, an 18th-century soldier, diplomat and spy who lived alternately as a man and a woman in France and England.The most recent is a “Bank of Duckie” nine-bob note, a fake banknote made for a 2008 club event called Gay Shame Goes Macho, featuring the gangster Ronnie Kray instead of the Queen.They join busts of the Roman emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous, a gender-fluid depiction of a Babylonian deity dating from 1800BC, and arguably the museum’s most famous gay object, the Warren Cup, a Roman drinking vessel showing two scenes of men making love.The museum is planning for reopening after the government gave the all clear for museums and galleries to open their doors from 4 July. A formal date has yet to be announced but the LGBT+ tours will be among the first tours to restart, said Frost. In the meantime the possibility of having them online is being explored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfcca9d879b974c4c42738f490bd5c247014c03/0_118_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7134c71435c93fb72575b55cff6e806d","title":"england class sizes largest in nearly 20 years","story":"Official data shows average class has 22 pupils, adding to union concerns over distancingClass sizes in England’s state secondary schools have ballooned to their largest size for nearly 20 years as a result of last decade’s baby boom, which teaching unions say underlines the difficulty of containing potential Covid-19 outbreaks.Overall, the number of state school pupils in England rose to nearly 8.9 million, with the numbers set to increase again in September. The government is preparing to ditch a string of physical distancing restrictions to meet Boris Johnson’s pledge that all pupils will be able to return to the classroom.The government is to announce next week that the use of smaller “bubbles” in primary schools – comprised of 15 pupils kept together with one teacher – will be dropped in favour of larger bubbles comprising an entire class.In secondary schools, the advice is likely to see entire year groups treated as one bubble, as suggestions that older pupils be kept apart within schools are dropped, according to a report in the Daily .But teaching unions said the new data from the school census underlined the difficulties for schools with crowded classrooms. The National Education Union (NEU) said that nearly a million schoolchildren were being taught in crowded classes with 31 or more pupils, which it described as “shocking”.“The prime minister knew this when he stated last week, and again in the Commons on Tuesday, that schools must open fully to all pupils every day from September,” said Mary Bousted, the NEU’s joint general secretary.Headteachers are adamant that any forms of physical distancing for pupils and staff can create logistical issues. One noted that while secondary school year groups of pupils could be contained, in many cases teachers regularly taught across different year groups, exposing them to greater risk.James Bowen, director of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “These figures should be ringing serious alarm bells for the government. They point to a system that was already under huge strain before the coronavirus pandemic put schools and colleges under enormous extra pressure.“Parents too will be concerned by the number of pupils being educated in class sizes of 31-plus. The government needs to address this problem urgently and make sure that all schools have the resources they need to keep class sizes at a manageable level.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said questions remained about how sixth-form and further education colleges would operate.“We will want to understand the public health guidance which underpins the approach to full reopening,” Barton said. “This is important for the confidence of parents, pupils, and staff. And, as none of us know what the coronavirus situation will look like in September, we think it would be sensible to have a plan B if the conditions do not allow for a full reopening.“We would also caution that a full return in September will not be school or college as normal. There will be a raft of safety measures in place, and we all need to prepare ourselves for the likelihood that there may be localised full or partial closures if there are outbreaks of the coronavirus, and this may be the reality for some time to come.”The assessment, which aims to gauge the abilities of children at their entry into formal schooling, has been delayed until 2021 “due to the challenging circumstances faced by schools in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic”, the DfE said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2da0f196d363461bfa37adbd87e155c78963104/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20189f29b378ebdb82a4eb8eab2d9160","title":"black in fashion council industry racism lindsay peoples wagner","story":"Council supported by 400 models, executives and editors is latest in a wave of US initiatives launched to create meaningful changeAfter the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, and in the wake of the ensuing Black Lives Matter protests, fashion has been having a long-overdue reckoning with racism. The Black in Fashion Council, which was announced on Wednesday, is just one of the organisations founded to hold the industry to account and create change.Started up by Teen Vogue editor Lindsay Peoples Wagner and publicist Sandrine Charles, the initiative’s mission is “to represent and secure the advancement of black iniduals in the fashion and beauty industry”.Wagner told industry site the Business of Fashion how the group would move beyond “cancel culture” to “accountability culture”. She continued: “We want to allow people to rise to the occasion of changing.”The organisation is teaming up with LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign to set up an equality index score and will work with brands, media companies, corporations and trade organisations, such as the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America), over at least the next three years to create index scores.As Peoples Wagner explains in Vogue: “The Human Rights Campaign already has a corporate equality index for people with disabilities and the LGBTQ community that companies like Kering are already a part of. This would be a way to continue to give companies a report card of accountability without them feeling like they’re being shamed into it, and giving them the actual resources of what people are saying they want to see changed.”Backed by a coalition of more than 400 black models, stylists, executives and editors, and an executive board that includes GQ deputy fashion editor Nikki Ogunnaike, Shiona Turini, the costume designer responsible for the outfits on the TV series Insecure and the film Queen and Slim, as well as the founder of Harlem’s Fashion Row, Brandice Daniel, it is due to launch in July.The Black in Fashion Council announcement comes in the wake of a number of other initiatives being set up to address racism in the industry. Earlier this week, Law Roach, stylist of Zendaya and Celine Dion, designer Jason Rembert and hair stylist Lacy Redway announced a new not-for profit organisation, the Black Fashion and Beauty Collective. Its website describes it as “a community of fashion and beauty creatives committed to directly influencing progression within the fashion and beauty industries and the black community”.These initiatives led by black professionals come after criticism of the CFDA’s announcement of plans to “create systemic change” in fashion.Kerby Jean-Raymond, Pyer Moss designer and CFDA board member, called it a “watered-down, bubblegum-ass statement that didn’t address the issues”, speaking to Highsnobiety. And a group of about 250 black industry professionals responded with the Kelly Initiative, named after Patrick Kelly, the Grace Jones and Princes Diana-approved black couture designer who became the first American member of the Chambre Syndicale du Prêt-à-Porter in 1988.The Kelly Initiative established a petition criticising the CFDA for not going far enough, saying it had “allowed exploitative cultures of prejudice, tokenism and employment discrimination to thrive” and calling on it to provide “data on the racial makeup of employees at all levels”.Meanwhile, it has been announced that Paris fashion week will go ahead in September, one of the few events not to go digital because of the pandemic. It will be a moment to see if the industry has begun to make some urgent changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0a53a5eabd44b4f662b2966839007efed38fd5/0_0_4561_2739/master/4561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f51266c1dcb4c0139caf4613327672","title":"glastonbury is 50 the best style moments in pictures","story":"From Kate Moss’s mini-minidress in 2004 to Lizzo in lilac sequins and Dennis Brown’s 80s double denim, here are 35 great looks seen at Worthy Farm over the years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c16a1488ae3c1bceee698c37ab185f10d694789/849_0_2143_1286/master/2143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=650534dcd528f1152508677236d29d91","title":"julie walters best film performances ranked","story":"With her latest film, The Secret Garden, arriving in August, here’s a look at Walters’ greatest big-screen roles – from Educating Rita to PaddingtonLewis Gilbert directed Walters in her seminal movie debut, Educating Rita, and although this stagey and subdued film (Gilbert’s last) doesn’t have anything like the fizz of that, Walters gives it her considerable best. She is the eldest of three sisters uneasily reunited for their mother’s funeral (the other two are Joanne Whalley and Victoria Hamilton). Walters is Teresa, a housewife devoted to her mother’s memory and very domineering when it comes to her husband, played by Tom Wilkinson. A strong character performance.It’s a tearjerker and a heartwarmer these things can be a bit formulaic, but Walters puts some heat under this. She is Jackie, the funny, lippy mate of Dawn, played by Brenda Blethyn, who is a lot quieter and devoted to her family. When Dawn gets cancer, Jackie decides the best thing is for the two of them to go on a massive girls-night-out trip to Las Vegas, using Dawn’s recent winnings from the bingo. In many ways, the emotional dynamic is similar to Calendar Girls, but this is likable stuff.This film and its 2017 sequel were tremendous treats, and there was surely never any doubt as to who was going to play Mrs Bird, who in Michael Bond’s original books was the Brown family’s no-nonsense housekeeper, keeping a keen eye on Paddington’s misdemeanours. Walters plays the role very nicely, and in fact Mrs Bird’s existence has been updated a bit – she is now a sort of vaguely defined family friend or distant cousin – although there isn’t much for her to do.This was Richard E Grant’s bittersweet movie memoir of his boyhood in Swaziland in southern Africa in the late 60s, just before independence. The grownups were the sun-dried white colonialists, bored, alcoholic, adulterous, casually racist. Nicholas Hoult plays the lonely teen Ralph (a version of Grant) and Walters pinches every scene as “Auntie” Gwen, who enjoys jokes about liking drinks “stiff” and whose husband is having an affair with Ralph’s mother.Walters has a very brief role in this superlative film, but she makes it count. She plays Elsie Orton, the mother of the dramatist Joe Orton (Gary Oldman), who is flustered when a council official comes round to congratulate Joe on his theatrical talent. She gestures at Joe’s father, saying: “That’s my husband, ignore him.” Walters continues to take a bite out of this film even after her character is dead. Elsie wore a complete set of false teeth and after her demise, Joe gives these teeth as a prop to the female actor playing a fictional version of her in his new play.Another “mum” role for Walters, but with a seriousness and tenderness that movie screenwriters don’t often let her show. She is Marion, the mother of Rose, played by Jessie Buckley, a young woman with two kids who has been in trouble with the law and now lives with her mum under house arrest, wearing an ankle bracelet. But Rose has got a brilliant singing voice and a passion for country music, so it seems that it’s Marion’s job to look after her children while Rose chases the showbiz dream. Walters conveys Marion’s complex mix of frustration and love.Walters plays June, the poignantly disaffected wife of Buster Edwards, one of Britain’s “Great Train Robbery” gang who stole millions in 1963 and – although unarmed – brutally coshed the train driver, who never fully recovered. Walters has a nice rapport with Phil Collins playing Buster and with Sheila Hancock as her mother. When she and Buster have to be extradition exiles in Brazil, she is stricken with homesickness and returns to Blighty before, finally, Buster comes back to be with her. Not a masterpiece, perhaps, but Walters is very good at selling a motherlywifely role with wit.In this true-life drama, Walters offers another of the quietly modulated supporting-character turns that have lent substance to so many movies. This one has a subtle complexity – and she was reunited with Jamie Bell, with whom she had a glorious performance in Billy Elliot. She plays Bella, the Liverpool-dwelling mother of Peter Turner (Bell), the young actor who in the late 70s was having an age-gap love-affair with the famed Hollywood star Gloria Grahame, played by Annette Bening. Long after their relationship has come to a painful end, the ageing and deeply unwell movie star poignantly asks to stay with Peter’s mum and dad. Walters shows how Bella, initially a kind of rival to the quasi-maternal Gloria, in effect becomes a caring mum for her.Walters plays the mother of Jane Austen in a speculative biopic that, with pastiche-Austen protocol, imagines the possibility that Austen had a real-life romance with a young Irish lawyer, played by James McAvoy. Walters’s Mrs Austen says things such as: “Affection is desirable money is absolutely indispensable.” But Walters’s most startling moment comes when Jane’s father, Rev George Austen (James Cromwell) snuggles down in the marital bed to perform an act of oral love on Jane’s mother. With the cares of so many children, it was perhaps the only intimacy he considered prudent.This is a juicy, nasty role for Walters in an interesting film scripted by Emma Thompson: the overbearing and malevolent figure Mrs Ruskin, mother of the great Victorian art critic John Ruskin (played by Greg Wise). She icily disapproves of his marriage to an impudent young woman, Effie Gray (Dakota Fanning) – a marriage that was famously to founder on the wedding night, due to Ruskin’s apparent fastidious horror that a real woman’s body was different from the classical nude. Walters is ferociously hostile to Effie and brings an effortless air of malign contempt.The real-life murder case from France that inspired Jean Genet’s The Maids was also the source of Wendy Kesselman’s 1988 play My Sister in This House, which she adapted for the screen with Nancy Meckler directing. The result is a strange, stylised, claustrophobically dark satirical drama. Walters plays the unspeakable Mme Danzard – smug, wealthy, entitled – who lives with her pampered daughter, Isabelle (Sophie Thursfield). Their relationship is bizarre, dysfunctional and unfolds in tandem with that of their sensuous, mutinous maids (played by Jodhi May and Joely Richardson). The power dynamic explodes in violence. Walters provides a discreet, potent spark.Walters gave what some believe was one of her most underrated performances in this bizarre blackly comic crime drama based on the macabre real-life case of Albert Goozee, who in 1956 murdered his landlady and her teenage daughter. (Having been freed from Broadmoor in 1971, he was convicted of another sexual assault case in 1996, the year of this film’s release, which could account for its muted reception.) Walters gives a powerhouse serio-comic turn as Marjorie, a bustling and sexually repressed landlady having an oedipal affair with her young lodger (Rupert Graves) while involving her teenaged daughter in this unwholesome ménage-à-trois. Walters has a fierce, driven presence.Walters has an enormous amount of fun with her role here – as do the audience. She plays “Dame” Evie Walton, a terribly grand retired star of stage and screen (although her damehood seems to exist only in her head) who towards the end of her career only appeared in Acorn-Antiques-type telly, and now spends her time declaiming Shakespeare in her back garden. She hires a nervy young assistant (played by Rupert Grint) and insists that he drive her everywhere in Miss Daisy style, despite the fact that he is only a learner himself. This shy and lonely young man finds an unexpected friend and ally in Dame Evie.There may not be a very big role for Walters here, but if ever an actor was utterly in tune with the feel, the tone and the audience of a big movie franchise it is Walters in Mamma Mia! and the distinctively weirder Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018), the colossally corny yet lucrative and widely adored jukebox musicals based on the songs of Abba. Walters radiates fun and humour, playing Rosie – who along with Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the best friend and former bandmate of Donna (Meryl Streep) who was in a group called Donna and the Dynamos. Walters is an important dilithium crystal powering the film.A cracking performance from Walters in a movie that was to become a feelgood pop culture phenomenon, both in the cinema and on the London stage. It is based on the true story of the Rylstone and District branch of the WI in Yorkshire, which becomes a media sensation after bringing out a cheeky semi-nude calendar to raise money for a local hospital. Walters plays Annie, the tough widow behind everything, her gutsy humour and fierce common sense concealing her hurt and vulnerability. Helen Mirren plays Chris, her fearless mate, with whom she has an awful row when the Calendar Girls become an international and over-commercialised hit.Harry Potter is famously a hero all alone in the world an orphan. And so there could hardly be a more important or quasi-maternal figure to the youthful Harry, at least at first, than the mum of his mate Ron Weasley – that is, Molly Weasley, played by Walters, who is crucially to introduce Harry to the mystery of Platform 9¾. Walters was in seven out of the eight Potter films and her apotheosis came in the final movie, in which Molly takes on the death eater Lieutenant Bellatrix Lestrange (played by Helena Bonham Carter) when Bellatrix nearly kills her daughter, Ginny. “Not my daughter, you bitch!” snarls Walters and there is an epic wand duel between the two of them.Walters delivered a glorious blast of focused comedy in this heartfelt drama, based on the Colm Toibin novel, with Saoirse Ronan as Eilis, a shy young woman who emigrates from 50s Ireland and finds herself in New York, where she finds love with an Italian boy. Her landlady is the sharp-tongued Mrs Kehoe, sumptuously played by Walters, who presides over a nightly dinner that all her young tenant ladies are expected to attend. She is on the lookout for any sign of giggly flightiness. “I’ll tell you this much,” Kehoe snaps. “I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness. I now see that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin. A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse!”This was the one of the great performances from Walters in this subversively unsexy sex comedy, all about the joyless hypocrisy of the British approach to sex. She plays Christine Painter, based on the real-life suburban “madam” and brothel keeper Cynthia Payne. Her Christine is an essentially placid soul who rises from being a waitress to hosting regular “parties” that are bizarrely ordinary in their outlook, offering tea and cooked breakfasts to follow whatever pervy shenanigans are demanded by her clients, who include high court judges. Walters plays a woman who presides over a world, not of exciting erotica, but absurdly tacky and dull kitchen-sink drear.This was the sensational and Oscar-nominated performance, in a movie adapted from Willy Russell’s stage hit, that launched the 33-year-old Walters towards becoming a national treasure, although not to the international stardom that appeared at first to be possible. Walters (wise and sane as always) decided that Hollywood was not for her. It was perhaps the only movie role in which she was a young and quasi-romantic female lead – playing a tough working-class autodidact called Susan, who has rechristened herself after the feminist author Rita Mae Brown. She attends night-school tutorials run by a boozy and disillusioned old humanities professor, wonderfully played by Michael Caine, and demands instruction in English literature. Her heartbreaking trust and naivety in his abilities and the power of literature itself causes Caine’s raddled old don to question himself and fall in love with her. Walters delivered a spiky megavolt jolt to the movie, and perhaps to the stagnant world of Brit cinema generally with her fierce and passionate performance.“Miss, you don’t fancy me, do you?” “No, Billy. Funnily enough, I don’t. Now piss off!” Walters’s delivery of her line, holding on the pause with masterly skill, and then rebuking Billy for his presumption while keeping it light, showed her control of this great role. She plays Mrs Wilkinson, the dance teacher into whose class young Billy (Jamie Bell) accidentally strays while supposedly taking boxing lessons next door and in which he shows precious talent. The exchange comes when Mrs Wilkinson tells Billy: “For some time now I’ve been thinking about the Royal Ballet school.” – “Aren’t you a bit old, miss?” “No, not me, YOU! I’m the BLOODY TEACHER!”Walters and Bell had a wonderful rapport in this film, and were, apart from everything else, a great comedy double act. She takes it upon herself to teach him and in some ways she is a redeemed, hopeful version of Caine’s professor in Educating Rita. And her relationship with Billy reaches its high point in the outstanding dance scene they have together to the accompaniment of T Rex’s I Love to Boogie. It’s a modern Brit cinema classic – an irresistibly funny, lovable sequence, perhaps because Walters is not, in fact, a natural dancer. But she gives it everything she’s got and the result is genuinely joyful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b0a32068157d67249b571dd9ba27182b4f4532/0_69_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6b94c13e79080bcc557b80c97353e37","title":"share your best and worst lockdown baking experiences","story":"Have you been baking up a storm during the pandemic?

The vote was not as close as anticipated, with the combined bid of Australia and New Zealand receiving 22 votes to Colombia’s 13.Australia and New Zealand had received public backing from the Asian Football Confederation, which has seven votes, and won support from all members of the council from the Confederation of African Football and Concacaf, which represents North and Central America and the Caribbean.The president of New Zealand Football, Johanna Wood, said: “We believe we have been given a treasure and we will look after that treasure. We will work towards putting women’s football even more front and centre on the world stage.”On the eve of the vote a meeting of Uefa delegates to the Fifa council appeared to have swung the odds in favour of Colombia after two members criticised the Fifa technical reports into the bids and argued that because the Women’s World Cup was a “development tournament” representatives should back Colombia.Falling in line, all nine Uefa members did so, alongside the South American delegates, despite, according to a source, the French representative, Noël Le Graët, and the Football Association’s Greg Clarke feeling frustrated at the difficult position they found themselves in following a perceived steamrollering of the decision in the meeting.Clarke is up for re-election as a Uefa representative on the council next year, and the FA will also likely be conscious of which confederations it upsets before a likely bid to host the 2030 men’s World Cup.It is understood Clarke turned down a call this week from New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who took part in last-ditch phone calls urge delegates to back the joint bid.Fifa’s technical reports gave the Australia and New Zealand bid a score of 4.1 out of five and Colombia a score of 2.8. The neighbouring nations ran a slick campaign that involved recruiting more than 800,000 public backers to its #AsOne team and a joint letter to the Fifa council from Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Ardern two days before the vote that promised to create “a profound and enduring legacy for the future of women’s football within the region and beyond”.Uefa explained its decision to back Colombia by saying: “Even though the Colombian bid was not the one rated highest technically by Fifa, European members of the Fifa council felt it represented a strategic opportunity for the development of women’s football in South America thanks to the legacy and increase of attention for the women’s game that the tournament would bring to the continent.“It was a choice between two countries – Australia and New Zealand – where women’s football is already strongly established, and a continent where it still has to be firmly implanted and has a huge development potential. It’s important to add that European members of the Fifa council agreed to vote together on major issues as a matter of solidarity.”Brazil withdrew its bid on 8 June, unifying the South American vote behind Colombia, which Japan cited as a factor when it pulled out of the race on the 22 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d32d8f7a18fc60c51a6ce5c76fc573b14f61c057/21_0_2945_1767/master/2945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07b1686ed08a6726f04f667d62b125a","title":"burnley v watford premier league live","story":"74 min: And no doubt that Rodriguez goal will be greatly welcomed across Bournemouth, West Ham and Aston Villa.

The ball bounced to another ex-West Brom striker whose shot was cleared off the line by an ex-West Brom defender after the ex West Brom keeper crazily came out of his goal again. Up the Baggies!”20 min: Vydra rattles a post! The Burnley striker races on to a through ball, Ben Foster comes flying out of goal and Vydra loops the ball over the Watford goalkeeper and towards goal. Rodriguez smacks the rebound goalwards but Craig Dawson hacks it off the line and then Brownhill skews wide. Watford get off the hook.17 min: Rodriguez stings the palms of Foster! Burnley work an opening down the left, with Vydra supplying his strike-partner to his right. Rodriguez opts to shoot from 20 yards but, further to his right and arriving late into the box was an unmarked Josh Brownhill. In hindsight, he will maybe feel that shooting was not the best decision there.16 min: Watford spurn another half-chance! McNeil is guilty of squandering possession and Sarr rampages down the right flank before picking out a cross. Danny Welbeck does the hard part, stealing the ball away from James Tarkowski but his touch is heavy and that enables Nick Pope to gather. The Burnley left-back, Charlie Taylor, was caught upfield because of the poor blind pass by McNeil and Sarr drove into acres of space before Welbeck fluffed his lines. Welbeck does look a little rusty here.14 min: Jay Rodriguez heads home ... but the flag is up! Brownhill plays a delicious cross into the box but the Burnley striker had strayed offside before powering a header beyond Ben Foster. Both teams have worked a couple of openings.11 min: A communication mishap by Welbeck and Deeney, with the former taking the ball away from the Watford skipper, sees a promising move break down. Deeney did brilliantly in the first place, nodding a cross down for Welbeck. Tarkowski gets a toe to it but cannot trap the ball and Deeney looks to wind up for a shot but Welbeck ends up doing Burnley’s defending for them.9 min: Rodriguez is flagged offside after latching on to Matt Lowton’s cross but Burnley are certainly beginning to gather some momentum.7 min: Another Burnley chance – and Josh Brownhill should do better! The Burnley midfielder heads off target after meeting a wonderful cross by Dwight McNeil. It zoomed across to the back post where Brownhill had ghosted beyond full-back Adam Masina but his effort was poor and bobbled out for a goal-kick.6 min: Rodriguez goes close! He forces Ben Foster into a smart save low down to his right after galloping on to a floated ball by Ashley Wood over the top of the Watford defence and smacks an effort goalwards. Craig Dawson, in particular, was caught cold. But Watford manage to hack it clear after the ball springs up in the air.4 min: ... Hughes picks out an unmarked Craig Dawson at the back post but the Watford defender goes for goal from an acute angle and heads it straight at Nick Pope, who comfortably gathers. Dawson was totally unmarked and would have been better off trying to nod it across in search of a team-mate or two.3 min: Cork cuts across Deeney and Watford win a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Cleverley and Will Hughes are stood over it. Kabasele and co come up for it ...2 min: A typically low-key start. Watford wallop the ball back downfield after Burnley enjoy some early possession.Watford kick-off after both sets of players take a knee.Kick-off is almost upon us. It is absolutely sizzling at Turf Moor, circa 31 degrees. Burnley trudge out of the tunnel, Watford, led by Troy Deeney, seemingly via the back door from another crevice.Team news news: a combination of Burnley’s skeleton squad and injuries to top scorers Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes means Sean Dyche again names two goalkeepers on the substitute bench. Burnley are unchanged despite a humbling 5-0 defeat to Manchester City, with Josh Brownhill, a January signing from Bristol City, again favoured in right midfield. As for Watford, Welbeck and Cleverley make their first starts under Nigel Pearson, with Doucouré and Pererya dropping to the bench.A reminder you can, if you really want, join Paul Doyle for Arsenal’s trip to Southampton:If you haven’t already spotted the glorious news: “The channel that shows Premier League games here in the US has decided to broadcast this game over the game involving Arsenal which they have put behind their paywall,” emails J.R. in Illinois. “I was surprised when I found that out but I’m no longer surprised now that I see Mike Dean (and his beard) will be reffing this game. Of the two noon kick-offs (6pm for you) I actually wanted to watch this one anyway. With David Luiz suspended and therefore unable to provide entertainment there’s no real reason to watch Arsenal ...”Watford’s final warm-up game ahead of the restart was against Brentford, for whom the Algerian winger Saïd Benrahma dazzled, notably fooling full-back Kiko Femenía: Be it with back-heels, rainbow flicks or making the opposition look silly, few players outside the Premier League have made a bigger impression than Saïd Benrahma in the past couple of seasons. The Brentford winger boasts an endless box of tricks but he is more than just easy on the eye – he is approaching double figures in assists after equalling last season’s goal tally of 11 with eight Championship games to play. His speciality is sliding the ball through the legs of dazed defenders. “He could nutmeg a mermaid,” said Sam Saunders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/788c092b648feaa8201a03e57a78f3a97348b534/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df0a399810f46547de581e1b1c03c748","title":"chelsea v manchester city premier league live","story":"The in-form Phil Foden has picked up an injury and is not in the City squad.

Chelsea and Manchester City have been the champions in five of the last six Premier League seasons, and tonight they are involved in another potential title decider. But it has the square root of bugger all to do with them. This is all about Liverpool, who will become champions of England for the first time since 1990 should City fail to win at Stamford Bridge.City are going to finish second in the league whatever happens, and have a theoretically more important game at Newcastle in the FA Cup on Sunday. But they would love to land the first punch of the 2020-21 title race by delaying Liverpool’s coronation tonight and then beating them at the Etihad next week.Chelsea need cold, hard league points rather than statements of intent. They still don’t know whether they must finish fourth or fifth to qualify for the Champions League. Either way, they are only two points ahead of Manchester United and Wolves in fifth and sixth, and this is the start a tough run-in.Six of Chelsea’s last nine games are against teams in the top ten, most of them away from home.

Ceballos’ attempted clearance is pap, as the ball skims of the top of his head and on to Redmond, who controls it nicely and fires a snapshot into the sidenetting. If that had been on target it would have been a proper test for Martinez, who has not had much to deal with it so far.70 min: During a break in play, the camera picks up Ozil in a seat in the stands, sitting with his feet up and holding a dainty parasol. Now what words does that picture paint?68 min: Arsenal are beginning to sink very deep. Armstrong is allowed to pick up the ball wide on the right and bustle his way in-field before walloping a shot just ove the bar from 20 yards.66 min: After a spell of Saints pressure that Arsenal absorb competently, the visitors launch a counter-attack through Nketiah and Aubameyang. They combined nicely right up until the last pass, when their attack fizzled out.64 min: Arsenal go to sleep as Saints take a throw-on the left . Long pokes the ball on to Ings, who can’t keep down his shot from 10 yards.62 min: Ward-Prowse flicks on a corner at the near post. Bednarek fetches it beyond the far one and sends it back across the face of goal. But arsenal bundle it to safety.59 min: Walker-Peters whips over a useful cross. Holding is in the way, as he has been for most of the evening so far.56 min: Saka is a delight. He leads a flowing Arsenal counter-attack which looks like yielding a goal until the backtracking Ward-Prowse makes a vital block.54 min: Whatever about the lack of fans, a Premier League in which Arsenal are disciplined, diligent and smart is going to take some getting used to after all these years of drift. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves: there’s more than half an hour left....52 min: Martinez picks out Aubemeyang with a fine long kick out of his hands. The Gabonese hurtles down the left and into the box. He could shoot. But he selflessly tries to feed Nketiah, who running into the centre of the box. Bednarek slides in to poke the ball back to the keeper! A goal-saving intervention for sure. 50 min: A sweeping move down the left by Southampton, who’ve found a bit of urgency. When the ball is pulled back to the edge of the area, via a deflection, Ward-Prowse tonks his shot a couple of yards over the bar.47 min: Walker-Peters collects a long diagonal pass and scampers towards the Arsenal box. But Saka keeps pace with him and puts the ball out for a corner, which come to nowt.46 min: Walker-Peters has replaced Valery for the second half. That can be taken as a tribute to Saka, who clearly had the better of Southampton’s first-choice right-back. Also, Long has come on for his compatriot, Obafemi.The goal presented to Nketiah by McCarthy is the difference between the two teams. Arsenal have managed their lead pretty well since then, not that Saints have seemed hellbent on equalising. It’s a low-key game in the sun. Hasenhüttel should get a-hollerin’ at half-time.45 min: Stephens rolls a pass back to McCarthy. Remembering what happened last time, Nketiah chases after it. McCarthy seems unflustered and calmly passes back to Stephens. Nketiah is inches away from intercepting. 42 min: Ward-Prowse sends a corner towards the edge of the six-yard box. Holding makes it is and heads emphatically clear.41 min: Good tackle by Bellerin to tip the ball away from Bertrand after Southampton mounted a decent attack, with Armstrong and Obafemi instrumental in it. “VAR exists to overturn clear and obvious errors,” notes CP Pricey. “So can we take another look at David Luiz contract extension?”39 min: Arsenal pop passes around with something close to a swagger. Southampton’s early vim has faded and now they are standing off the visitors. That suits Arsenal fine. It’s doesn’t make for great TV, though.37 min: Arsenal are looking comfortable. That, of course, is when they are their most dangerous to themselves.35 min: Saka has looked dangerous every time he’s got the ball, gliding past Valery on a regular basis. 32 min: Tierney ks a long diagonal cross from halfway towards Bellerin, roving forward down the opposite flank. Bertrand does well to halt the Spaniard’s progress and then relieve him of the ball.29 min: Kevin Towl writes in to note that Nketiah deserves credit for putting pressure on McCarthy, which is a fair point. “Credit for chasing lost causes,” writes Kevin of a quality that Arsenal have seldom shown lately.28 min: With an exquisite piece of control Ings takes down a pass into the box and then flips the ball to Redmond, who smashes it across the face of goal. Armstrong lunges at it but can’t get a telling touch.23 min: After Bellerin gives the ball away in the opposing half, Southampton attack the space behind him. Armstrong ultimately gets off his team’s first shot on target. All it does is give Martinez a nice easy taste of the action.A bizarre mistake by McCarthy gifts a goal to Arsenal. The goalkeeper ambled out of his box to receive a passback, then took a touch to control it before sidefooting a pass ... straight to Nketiah! The striker, closing on in from about six yards away, accepts the present and lopes past the goofing keeper to roll the ball into the empty net. Did the heat get to the keeper? That was a real brain-melting moment. Is Arteta’s luck beginning to turn?18 min: Ceballos flashes over a dangerous corner. Ward-Prowse, of all people, leaps high to head clear.15 min: A reply of Aubemeyang’s shot shows that McCarthy got a tiny but possibly critical touch on it. If he had not done so, the shot might have gone into the net via the underside of the bar. Meanwhile, Mary Waltz is not dancing around the issue of David Luiz’s new contract. “Arteta is a good man, he will be a fine coach,” mails Mary. “But signing David Luiz to a new contract was a massive error. Yes he shows signs of brilliance in moments but he always has that moment where his brain shuts off. Arteta could have let him go and no one would have blamed him.” Arteta values David Luiz’s character and, also, if he let him go, what kind of replacement would Arsenal sign?14 min: Ceballos dithers on the ball just inside his own half. Ings pinches it off him and scurries towards the Arsenal box, weaving his way into a shooting position. But Holding keeps track off him and blocks his shot.12 min: A Southampton freekick from the left is cleared as far as Armstrong, who has a bang from nearly 30 yards. He strikes it powerfully but nowhere near the target.10 min: A long, curling pass from Tierney in the left-back position gives Aubameyang something to chase. Of course he wins the race, leaving Saints’ defenders in the dust as he collects the ball and dashes into the box from the left. He shapes to curl towards the far corner with his right foot ... McCarthy goes down ... and the striker sidefoots a powerful shots over him ... and onto the crossbar! 9 min: Good from Arsenal! A crisp passing move concludes with Xhaka sliding a pass through to Saka, who lays the ball across the face of goal from the left, leaving Pepe with a tap-in. But Saka was offside when he received the pass so there’s no score. Encouraging precision and movement from Arsenal, though. Apart from the offside, obviously.7 min: Ceballos pounces on a mistake by McCarthy and feeds Aubameyang, who lashes off a shot from 20 yards ... and an offside position. It wouldn’t have counted, but the keeper felt the need to atone for his error anyway and made the save.6 min: Southampton have had most of the ball so far but Arsenal have kept a good shape and not ceded any openings. It’s all happening at a fairly sedate pace, which is probably to be expected with the heat.4 min: Aubameyang works back diligently to nick the ball off Valery at the left-hand corner of the Arsenal box.3 min: The home side have made the brighter start, without threatening. Arsenal haven’t pieced together any kind of passing sequence yet.1 min: Southampton kick off. That means knocking the ball backwards for someone to boom a long diagonal pass towards the left-hand touchline. It’s what nearly everyone does.Arsenal, dressed in a sunny all yellow kit, are full of smiles as they await kickoff. Certainly no sign of angst in their demeanour. Either they are confident or they’re not much bothered about the kick-around. We’ll soon find out which it is.Weather check: It’s 30C at St Mary’s. The forecast says rain is due at some point in the coming hours but right now the sky is like postcard from the Caribbean. Would you like to listen to the Football Weekly podcast? If so, have this:Southampton’s manager notes the intense heat on the south coast and declares: “the fitter team will win today.” If that’s true, a home win seems the smart bet (note: betting is not smart).Asked why the feisty young Frenchman is not included today, Arteta says “It’s squad management. Squad management.” And then adds intriguingly: “Whatever internal issue we have, we deal with it privately. As you can see from the lineups below, Arteta has made four alterations to the side that started the defeat to Brighton. Leno’s injury means Martinez gets the goes, while Xhaka’s recovery means Guendouzi can ... have the evening off: he’s not even on the bench. But Kolasinac and Lacazette are, as they are replaced by Tierney and Nketiah. Ozil is back in the squad but only as an onlooker for the moment. Southampton, meanwhile, stick with the same side who thumped Norwich six days ago.A post-lockdown mid-table skirmish in oppressive heat does not sound like a must-watch, but this has the makings of a fascinating match. Southampton begin three points lower in the table but seems to be in a slightly better place than Arsenal insofar as they are edging their way to brighter days under a manager who knows what’s what. Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, is still trying to make sense of the puzzle that is Arsenal. That might not even be possible, but we can sure look for clues today.Southampton resumed the season impressively by trouncing Norwich at Carrow Road last weekend, and they will be aiming to reproduce that form at St Mary’s, where they have struggled this season, which is why they have the worst home record in the Premier League. But Arsenal do not look like fearsome visitors – they have won only twice away all season and, of course, flopped on the south coast last weekend by losing in the last minute Brighton.That defeat confirmed that Arteta is still far from knowing how to move forward with Arsenal, a team with lots of skill but a shortage of balance, creativity, gumption and a midfield, amongst other things. They’ve also been out of luck recently, with Bernd Leno’s injury against Brighton deprived him of another key player. It’s not always easy to know who is a key player for Arsenal these days: is Alexandre Lacazette? Is Nicolas Pépé? Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang? Mesut Ozil? How about Dani Ceballos, whose loan was extended this week? Or David Luiz, who signed a new contract on Wednesday? There are lots of questions about this Arsenal team. This is their latest chance to begin fleshing out convincing answers.Let’s be having you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6ceece18933c660b02dab90d54540038067d43/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=756526cd71d324bd286fd73b1133d608","title":"trauma and triumph my father his dementia and surviving segregation","story":"For my father, marooned in the Emmett-Tamir loop he could not stop, 1955 was 2017I had just entered my father’s nursing-home room when he swung his head around and pronounced, “They killed that boy in Mississippi.”Not the greeting I expected. I was startled by how swiftly he turned and pinned his gaze on me. Confined to a wheelchair and the world of dementia, my father rarely moved that quickly anymore. He often would talk to me, full-out lucid conversations, without opening his eyes. But that day he looked at me intently, eyes wet and runny. Tears or discharge from an ongoing eye issue, I didn’t know.Neither did I know what he was talking about, and I felt ambushed by the simple declarative sentence about another black death at the hands of a “they” that I assumed to be police. I wracked my brain to recall the day’s headlines. Had I missed a shooting, an unexplained hanging, a suspicious suicide? There have been so many – too many to remember.Then, he said, insistently: “They killed that boy in Money, Mississippi,” and gestured to the television. Sound muted, it flashed new developments in the case of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Cleveland boy killed by police in late November 2014 as he played with snowballs and a pellet gun in a park. With the “Money” reference, I realized that my father was conflating Rice with Emmett Till. Another black boy, big for his 14 years, considered a threat and accused of “provoking” his own lynching in 1955 when a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, lied that he’d approached her sexually.It would do no good to correct my father the brain on dementia doesn’t always respond to reason. My father had vascular dementia. Different from the more common Alzheimer’s disease, it’s a form of cognitive and physical decline often caused by multiple strokes. Those strokes might be virtually undetectable until, cumulatively, they result in brain damage, confusion, and impaired mobility. When my father was diagnosed, a kind doctor told us that his brain was functioning like a camera shutter that’s constantly misfiring – sometimes fast, sometimes slow, collecting thousands of impressions that it couldn’t process or organize. But that didn’t mean that all memory was lost.This was the case with my father, who died this spring at the age of 86. His historical memory was remarkably intact. He could remember a football game from decades ago, the shebeen called Hell’s Half Acre that he frequented as a young, wild-oats-sowing man (the same place he tried to take my mother, who said, “I’m not that kind of girl” and demanded to be taken elsewhere). But he sometimes got stuck in a time machine.I realized, as my father spoke with a firm voice and brimming eyes, that he was of an age with Emmett Till. Could have been an older brother. I mulled turning off the TV or turning it to a sports channel. Distraction and ersion are your friends when a loved one has dementia. I wanted to dislodge this memory that defined his generation in the way that the killings of Trayvon Martin and George Floyd have and will define later ones.For my father, marooned in the Emmett-Tamir loop he could not stop, 1955 was 2017.I trotted out all the techniques I’d been taught by “memory care” experts. I changed the subject gently and agreed pleasantly when he seemed agitated, an old conflict-resolution trick called “fogging”.I left, thinking it had worked, until I heard that my father refused to have a white certified nursing assistant (CNA) bathe him.“She might say I’d try to rape her,” he said.My father became irate when a CNA said things like white women’s unfounded rape allegations against black men “didn’t happen”. He knew it did, from both the impersonal arc of history and family experience. Soon after, when my father had a bad reaction to steroids, he lashed out at his caregivers, shouting about the mistreatment he’d suffered as a black man born during the 1930s in rural Appalachia.I think of this moment often now, as I see and hear black elders talk about this latest racial spasm in our society and their lives. I worry for African American seniors like my father, who are living with dementia and struggle to make sense of eating breakfast. Or those who live in nursing homes where they are one of the few black residents (for years, my father was the only black man in his). I wonder if they see modern-day uprisings and are mentally catapulted into the fires that burned cities in 1968, if they see police brutality and marches, and think of the daily indignities of Jim Crow.I know that my 74-year-old mother does. Since George Floyd’s death, she’s commented multiple times about white children spitting on her from school buses she could not ride, how the state of South Carolina was so fixed on ridding the state of future “problems” that it paid the difference between in-state tuition and her out-of-state fees (better if educated Negroes went out of state and stayed there).A friend told me that her senior mother abruptly packed her bags and fled the city she lived in, going to the country town of her upbringing and resettling among her people. Maybe to flee Covid-19, maybe to find succor in open spaces and familiar faces. And these women, my mother included, don’t have dementia.My mother can talk about her feelings and sort through them consciously in a way my father couldn’t. I got to better understand his racial wounds as a survivor of segregation – and maybe we should think of black people of my parent’s generation just this way: as survivors. I heard more about the things that made him through the loss of inhibition that made him both irritable and so affectionate. My father told me that he loved me more as he declined. I heard about his adventures hunting, running bootleg liquor across state borders to earn money for graduate school, the fast pitch that almost took him to the Negro Leagues, the difficult horse he broke and trained.Dementia gave me my father in a new way. It also took him away.I cherish the times I have with my mother and listen to her stories of trauma and triumph. She has the Southern gifts of well-rehearsed public politeness and meaningless, cordial chitchat. Recently shopping in a grocery store, she had a brief encounter with a white woman customer, around her age, that gave her pause.“We were just saying hi to each other, in the aisle. We both had our masks on, and we were saying ‘How are you?” And I said, ‘These are trying times.’ She said, ‘Are things THAT bad for black people?”’ – a sign of both white oblivion and a pandemic-driven thirst for conversation.There’s little precedent for the multiple hits that everyone is taking now — with Covid-19 and police violence taking many black lives. Many black elders of the civil rights generation are aware that they are extremely vulnerable to coronavirus, but they may be hard to reach with the latest and best information.Boddie said: “The main thing is socialization. We have people who live in our housing and want to go in common areas together, who go to the grocery store as a group. We can’t do our chair exercises in a group. It’s hard to say to a grandmother that her grandson can’t come in and visit.”Boddie’s own grandmother, formerly a South Carolina native, celebrated her recent birthday, thanking God for seeing 90 years and not having coronavirus.In the past, she had her own domestic ritual to support civil rights activists – and it’s one she’s replicating now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3eab4723d10ba78b826c1611af7cb1b0b5aaadf/0_89_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a1c736e5d530c3d229fb24faa448de36","title":"coronavirus lockdown eased 4 july england pub hairdresser gym","story":"People in England will able to visit a pub, restaurant or hairdresser, but not a gymThe government has announced an easing of lockdown rules in England from 4 July. Hospitality and leisure businesses will be allowed to reopen, and there will be more freedom to see other people.From 4 July you will able to go to a pub, cafe or restaurant, visit a museum, library or theme park, watch a film at a cinema, or stay in a hotel or on campsite – as long as the venue can open safely. You can also be part of a group meeting at a place of worship. If you need to sort out your lockdown hair, you will be able to go to a hairdresser or barber.You can’t go to the gym or do any type of exercise class – the risk is still too great to allow people to breathe heavily while in close proximity. The risk level also means that you can’t watch a play, except on a screen, or live music. Soft play areas will still be closed, as will activities that involve sharing or borrowing equipment – for example bowling or ice-skating. In more bad news for anyone trying to shake off any lockdown pounds, swimming pools will remain closed. Beauty salons, casinos and nightclubs won’t reopen yet, nor will cricket clubs. If you are a church goer, you will not be allowed to sing at services.Yes – and friends. But it is complicated. You will be able to spend time indoors or outside with another household, either at home or at a pub or restaurant. If you are outside at a pub, you can meet up to five people from more than two households, but if you are inside the two household rule applies. Social distancing of 1-metre-plus will apply in all cases.If you are already in a support bubble, that will count as one household so you can all visit another set of friends or family. You can stay overnight at someone’s home and there are no restrictions on how far you can travel to see people. But again the 1- metre-plus social distancing rule applies.Yes, over-70s can meet others under the easing, but they have been advised to remain especially cautious as their risk of complications if they do get Covid-19 is higher than for younger people.The government says the fall in the number of infections and the fact that the R rate – the number of people each virus-positive person infects – has remained below 1 means it can reduce the social distancing guidance for England. Instead of insisting that businesses cater for people to stay 2 metres apart, the guidance has been reduced to 1-metre-plus. This means that people can be closer as long as there are other safety measures in place – such as more handwashing facilities and screens at venues, or you could be asked to wear a face mask or sit so you are not facing other people.It’s a yes to staycations – you can stay overnight at holiday homes and second homes, book hotels, caravan parks and campsites, and tourist attractions can reopen. You can visit one other household, as long as you maintain social distancing.As for trips abroad, the government is in discussion to create “air bridges” with other countries, which would allow people to travel without quarantining, and an announcement is expected in the next few days. The countries being considered include holiday favourites such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece.At the weekend Tui said it would resume trips to Spain and Greece on 11 July, suggesting that the ban on travel could end by then.In Wales there is no date set for pubs and other leisure outlets to reopen but tourism businesses have been told they can open on 6 July and take bookings from 13 July. It’s a similar situation in Scotland, although tourism could reopen in the middle of the month. In Northern Ireland pubs, cafes and restaurants can reopen from 3 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba717e2110b933f74be68ed146053d3415ae81d/0_87_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3c275b8f6622b10de4443a6818093f6f","title":"a new normal how has working from home been for you","story":"We’d like to hear from  readers for a video series about what’s next in the world of work In our video series, A new normal, we ask  readers what they want a future shaped by Covid-19 to look like.

If programmes have generally been a bit too conservative, no one could blame Hewitt for devoting hers entirely to Bach, whose music has been the thread through so many of her Wigmore appearances over the last 35 years.At first sight the programme she had devised seemed rather bitty, without a single really substantial work there was no partita or complete suite, either English or French. But the sequence – played seamlessly, without any interventions from the Radio 3 announcer, or any encore – was anchored by two hefty enough pieces: the C minor Toccata, BWV 911, and the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor, BWV 903.These days, Hewitt usually gives her recitals on a Fazioli piano, but here she stuck to the Wigmore’s own Steinway, which perhaps gave her performances a bit more muscularity and distinctive character than usual. There was a sinewy power to the fugue that ends the C minor Toccata and sinuous insistence about the one that follows the Chromatic Fantasy, while the explosion of crisply articulated energy in the Prelude from the sixth English Suite was as joyous as the Sarabande from the fifth French Suite was intimate and introspective. And Hewitt chose to end not with a flourish, but with her own transcription of the chorale prelude Alle Menschen müssen sterben, another moment of quiet reflection.• Available on BBC Sounds and the Wigmore Hall YouTube channel.

Its lyrics make reference to demonstrations: “Tell the ol’ boys in the white bread lobby  What they can and can’t do with their bodies  Temperatures risin’ cities are sinkin’”.The word Dixie is derived from Jeremiah Dixon, who in the 1760s gave his name to the Mason-Dixon, which came to demarcate the northern and southern states in the eastern US. There is no strict definition of the Dixie region, but it is usually used to describe the 11 slave-holding states that seceded in 1861 to form the Confederacy and were later defeated in the American civil war.There has been no announcement from the group explaining the change, beyond an unattributed quote in a press release: “If your voice held no power, they wouldn’t try to silence you.”The group originally took their name from Dixie Chicken, an album by US rock band Little Feat, when they formed in 1989.Their decision comes amid a reckoning about outdated or racist terminology and imagery in the US, as civil rights movements intensify efforts in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and others.Earlier in June another country group, Lady Antebellum, changed their name to Lady A, as “antebellum” is used to describe the slave-holding southern US before the civil war. In a statement, the group said they were “regretful and embarrassed to say that we did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word”.March March also makes reference to US school shootings, and the anti-gun demonstrations of Emma González and other young activists: “Brenda’s packin’ heat cuz she don’t like Mondays  Underpaid teacher policing the hallways … Standing with Emma and our sons and daughters  Watchin’ our youth have to solve our problems  I’ll follow them so who’s comin’ with me.”The Chicks are gearing up to release Gaslighter, their first studio album since 2006, on 17 July. Their three most recent albums have all topped the US charts. The group received widespread opprobrium in the country music scene for criticising George W Bush in 2003 over the invasion of Iraq, including death threats, and being blacklisted by many country music radio stations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36d76bffc41862e82c9758c1f75960ee771baf74/0_219_3795_2277/master/3795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f57f03ab821d2b382b27f5d361d4f12d","title":"mick jagger 50 years glastonbury festival triumph eccentric english culture","story":"I call Glastonbury ‘the alternate Ascot’ – a cultural event that embodies the odd side of Englishness and has an exuberant crowd unlike any otherThe truth of the matter is that Glastonbury never really asked the Rolling Stones to play before – I heard they had thought about it, but no official invitation was ever made. So as soon as we were asked, we did it.I remember Glastonbury in the old, ancient days, when it was originally a battle between people who wanted to go and do this sort of festival, and the police who didn’t want them to. My brother lives in Glastonbury, he used to go to the festival in its very early days, and it was always part of my family’s festival outings – my children Jade, Lizzy, Georgia and Jimmy had always gone for years, and they told me about their experiences. I always watched it on telly, and was pretty aware of what was going on.For the 2013 festival, I went the night before we were to play to get the feeling of the weekend, and I watched the Arctic Monkeys to get the vibe of the crowd. Then I went around the site with my children and hung out with them. I was like a punter, a bit – went to the dance area, Joe Strummer’s area, a few other places. I was slightly less punterish in that I didn’t have to walk all of it – I did manage to get a ride.The next day was a perfect English summer day, and I was very thankful for that. I spoke to Bono when he had his Glastonbury experience, which he said was one of the most difficult days he’s ever done a concert – it was mindblowingly difficult because of the weather. I was afraid it was going to be the same for us, but it didn’t turn out like that.I was a bit wary of it, if people were really going to get it – but they got it.Going on was this amazing sight. I’ve done a lot of big crowds, but normally when you do these big crowds you can’t often see them. In this case, though, the crowd goes up the hill and was illuminated by flares. You could actually see 100,000 people, which was amazing. The crowd was amazingly supportive, vibrant, enthusiastic, exuberant – even though you’re a long way away from them, you can still feel the wave of feeling coming from them.Glastonbury has had a long, involving history, as almost a protest, and then evolving into this anything-goes, very different, multi-generational event, with every kind of music represented and lots of other things besides. I used to joke that it’s the alternate Ascot, which is maybe a bit of a misnomer, but it’s an amazing English cultural event that embodies some kind of Englishness – some odd Englishness. Glastonbury is a great tradition, and the way it’s evolved, it sort of represents this rather eccentric English culture, in a really good way. Everyone reveres it because of that, and because of its longevity – it’s been passed down through generations. People have got this special affection for it.• Mick Jagger was talking to Laura Snapes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3095f6032b55f9daaf9696f8475070ece49cf2e/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d9553ac39e2b3cab196b439f7eab50cb 1290w","title":"britain beyond lockdown can we become cleaner coronavirus","story":"As Covid-19 accelerates the shift towards renewable energy, Jonathan Watts hears how this change risks causing intergenerational injustice in AberdeenLike many young people in Aberdeen, Mike Scotland dreamed of a well-paid job on a rig in the North Sea, in the oil and gas field that has made his home town a boom town for most of the past 40 years.In February the 28-year-old landed the position he had wanted with Shell, and he was due to take a helicopter to the Shearwater platform in July once he had completed training.“I don’t think I have ever been as excited about anything in my life,” he recalled. “All I ever wanted was to land a health and safety role on a rig. I really wanted to make a difference.”Then Covid-19 struck, oil prices crashed, new projects were cancelled and Scotland was laid off. He is now working as a team member at the KFC restaurant in the Haudagain retail park, where he earns the minimum wage.“I earn in a week what I would have made in a day on the rig, but I can support my family and that is the main thing,” said Scotland, whose fiancee is expecting their second child in July. “I appreciate I have a job. Many don’t.”Since the start of the crisis, thousands of workers have been laid off in Aberdeen, which is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Europe. The town was already struggling to recover from a sharp fall in crude prices five years ago, as well as increasing social pressure to rein back on fossil fuels that are destabilising the climate.The pandemic looks likely to accelerate the shift towards renewable energy, but while this raises hopes for a greener future, it also throws up huge concerns about intergenerational injustice. Without government intervention, the young look set to take a double hit from the post-lockdown economic downturn and the energy transition.No age group is immune to the shift, but those closer to retirement are more likely to have a nest egg saved up from the golden era of North Sea oil.Timothy Robinson, 62, a petroleum geologist, has decided to retire early as a result of the coronavirus downturn, which he believes is likely to choke the revival of the oil industry in AberdeenIn terms of the economic fallout from Covid-19, Aberdeen is likely to be among the worst-affected cities in Britain. This is partly because it has so much to lose. The city has grown affluent thanks to its offshore expertise, which is in demand around the world. The population here are highly globalised, and many technicians and consultants fly off for several months of the year to do lucrative contract work on oil fields in Africa, South America or Asia.But a  callout to readers about the impact of coronavirus revealed a huge number of job losses that some say are barely covered in the media.Nicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, explained how her once-prosperous home city had been affected. Chatting on wicker chairs in the spacious garden outside her traditional granite house, she said house prices had slumped, people were stuck in negative equity and there were no jobs. Efforts to ersify the local economy by attracting more tourists have been hit by delays to the £350m harbour development. Restaurants and hotels are empty.“It’s a domino effect here as ‘Aber-dream’ turns to ‘Aber-nightmare’,” she said. “There are bleak times ahead. That’s what happens when an industry is dying and a pandemic arrives.”On the seafront, seagulls circle noisily over roads and beaches that are considerably emptier than those along the coastline south of the border. A helicopter buzzes overhead, taking workers out to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea, but the number of such flights is far lower than six months ago. Andrew Duncan (not his real name) used to be a frequent passenger because he specialises in maintenance of drilling equipment. Last week he was laid off after more than five years’ employment at a major oil service company.He believes the Covid-19 crisis is being used by some firms as an excuse to accelerate restructuring plans. “I’m absolutely gutted. They went about it in an underhand, sneaky way,” he said. “I was treated as if I was just another asset, like a piece of equipment.”He asked for his name to be changed because a public complaint could undermine his chances of getting a new job in the close-knit oil town, but he is seething at his experience.He is worried about how he can provide for his wife and child. “This is just the beginning. The oil industry faces a perfect storm of lockdown, low prices and climate change,” he said. Now he is applying for jobs in the wind turbine industry and oil rig decommissioning. “That is the future,” he said. He is encouraged by the Scottish government’s plans to support workers left adrift in the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. “If they could help me with training as a wind turbine technician, that would give me an extra chance.”The Scottish government has gone further than the rest of the UK in preparing its economy and workforce for a shift to renewables. Rachel McEwen is part of the Just Transition commission, which has been advising the Scottish government on ways to shift from high-carbon to low-carbon industry with minimum social disruption. “The opportunities for injustice are endless. We must think where bad things will happen and get ahead of them,” she said.She is also chief sustainability officer in one of Scotland’s leading companies, SSE, which last month announced a £3bn investment in a new windfarm off the Angus coast, just south of Aberdeen. The 1,075MW facility will be the country’s biggest ever privately funded project. McEwen said the numbers would mean little unless there was a positive social impact. “Companies like us have pinned our whole being on finding profitable solutions to climate change. If that transition is unfair, you delegitimise it. So we have an interest in ensuring it is done in a thoughtful and just way.”The potential for wind energy is evident at the Balmedie sand dunes, a short drive outside town. Gusts off the North Sea billow through the marram grass, allow kite-surfers to soar above the breakers and spin the giant turbine blades of a windfarm that sits a short distance away from the coastline. Locals joke that these giant structures were built as close as possible to the Trump golf course to infuriate the US president. But they are part of a broader trend. Aberdeenshire is said to be the largest windfarm in Europe in terms of the number of on- and offshore turbines. This is a major reason why wind is now the cheapest form of energy in the UK and has provided a substantial portion of our electricity during lockdown.Colette Cohen, the chief executiveof the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, is optimistic there will be more support for energy transition in Scotland.“From industry perspective and from government connections, I would say the only recovery is a green recovery. A lot of people have seen a better world and want a change,” she said. “It’s very exciting. It’s an amazing time to be involved in energy and technology.”Among the likely future developments are more offshore wind in the West Shetlands and the UK’s first hydrogen plant, which is expected within two years.But she warned there was likely to be a dip for between 18 months to three years, as the investment shifted direction. “That is the difficult time. That’s the worry. It is hard to see how we will navigate that effectively.”One element will be managing a generational shift: as boom-era oil workers retire and old rigs are decommissioned, opportunities for the young may be hard to find. Coronavirus has made that challenge even harder because it has shut down the service sector.This week Scotland’s advisory group of economic recovery recommended that the government provide a two-year job lifeline and training scheme for young people as part of £6bn in stimulus spending. “If we don’t intervene radically to transform our economy, inequalities will drastically widen, with long-term scarring for communities across the country and for our young people in particular,” said the chair of the group, Benny Higgins.It is a sensible step in keeping with Scotland’s more cautious – and successful – approach to dealing with the virus itself. The country, which continues with tighter lockdown restrictions than England, has fewer cases relative to its population and a faster falling rate of infections.This prudent approach of acknowledging risk and alleviating adversity may explain why even the worst-affected workers find reasons for hope. Mike Scotland said he was throwing himself full-hearted into his new job at KFC, as well as continuing work on the mental health and environmental charities he founded.“I get it when people say they are having a bad time, but that is not an excuse to give up. I am looking at this as a life lesson, a step outside my comfort zone,” he said. In the long run, he said, he believed his generation would get more opportunities because they were more familiar with technology and more open to new ideas than those who had come before them.“I think there are a lot of people who want to change and are ready to change. But others who are not ready. I guess Covid could speed it up. People have had more time to be at home and to think,” he said. “We have to expect the worst and hope for the best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f395586547da441e4671d1f8081585df77940f/196_299_1869_1122/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d967c7071d7e435751de35073a362884","title":"bluetooth or wifi a jargon free guide to connecting your audio to your smart devices","story":"Technology writer Holly Brockwell explains how to make the most of headphone-free listeningIn the streaming age, it’s easier than ever to connect up your tech so you can listen to all the best music and podcasts wherever you want, without wires trailing everywhere. If you’re one of Spotify’s 286 million monthly users, you’ve probably noticed an icon on your mobile app that looks like a computer monitor behind a speaker – that’s your portal to Spotify Connect, a super-simple way to play music on all your home tech devices, from your smart fridge to your laptop. But how does it work – and how does it stack up against other wireless streaming methods?Since 2018, Spotify Connect has been available for all users, however to be able to connect to every compatible device out there, you’ll need a Spotify Premium subscription. You can use it on your tablet, phone or computer as a kind of remote control to play what you want, where you want it – Spotify offers podcasts in addition to its extensive library of music. And unlike using a Bluetooth speaker, the music won’t stop if you receive a call.Using Spotify Connect is really easy. From the mobile app, choose something to play, then tap “devices available” underneath the song name. Next, tap the icon of a screen and a speaker, and you’ll get a list of all the Connect-compatible smart devices on your home network. You don’t have to add them, they appear automatically if they’re connected to wifi.The process on a computer is pretty similar: play something, then click the icon of a screen and a speaker in the bottom right of the app and choose your preferred device.There’s a vast range of compatible gadgets, so chances are that the device you want to play music on is on the list, but you can check here just in case.Once you’re streaming, you can use your phone or computer as normal: the audio comes directly from Spotify, not your device, so you can take calls and keep the music going. It doesn’t run your battery down, either.Moving the sound around is really straightforward: just tap a different device on the list and the music instantly continues there. This is especially handy when you’re moving rooms, or you need to switch away from the soundbar because someone wants to watch TV, for instance.And when it’s party time (after the pandemic, we might add!), use Spotify Connect to start a group session so that everyone can contribute to the playlist – another feature you can’t get with just Bluetooth or wifi. You’ll see the option to “Start a group session” at the bottom of your Spotify Connect device list, which gives you a code to share with friends so they can add their favourites.Bluetooth is an easy, near-universal wireless method of connecting one smart thing to another. That connection is called “pairing” and is usually simple to do – for instance, on many speakers, there’s a little button with the Bluetooth symbol (a stylised B that looks like a sideways pair of scissors) that you press to start sending out signals. Then, turn on Bluetooth via your phone, or whichever device you’re trying to connect to, scan for nearby Bluetooth gadgets and select your speaker from the list. The instructions vary slightly by device, so check the help files for yours if you’re stuck.Pairing is usually straightforward and only has to be done once – from then on it should work automatically. But Bluetooth does have its downsides too, the more distance there is between the music device and the speaker, the more chance there is for interference and sound drop out – something you don’t need to worry about with Spotify Connect. Thick walls can really mess up the connection too, as you’ll notice if you wander around the house with wireless headphones on.Bluetooth is the best choice for listening to music outside your home, because you can use it for portable speakers, car stereos and so on without needing to be close to a power socket or wifi router. However, it’s a real drain on the battery life of whatever device you’re streaming from.The connection can also be temperamental, varying on some devices more than others. If one of the gadgets you like to listen on often drops out, it’s worth trying a different method.Most devices that can play music, such as speakers, TVs, games consoles and even smartwatches have an app that helps you connect them to your home wifi network, and from there you can link up your streaming source.For instance, a smart speaker such as Google Home gets connected to wifi during setup, using its app. Once it’s ready, you just open the app settings and choose your preferred service for streaming music and podcasts, then start issuing voice commands – such as “OK Google, play Spotify”.The benefit of using wifi rather than Bluetooth is that you don’t have to worry about keeping your devices close together. As long as whatever’s playing the music is connected to wifi, you’re good – and you can use your phone for calls without cutting off the tunes.Spotify Connect runs on wifi, so you’ll see all these benefits, plus the added bonus that it will automatically seek out and connect with compatible devices. So if you are going to connect over wifi, it makes sense to do it via Spotify Connect.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Beck said detailed scrutiny of the fossils had only been completed now.Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Beck and colleagues from the US and Australia report how the analysis allowed them to draw up a new evolutionary family tree of vombatiforms, with Mukupirna representing a whole new family of the animals.The results reveal that Mukupirna is the closest fossil relative of the wombat family as a whole, suggesting wombats and Mukupirna evolved from a common ancestor.“Mukupirna is not the direct ancestor of wombats, but it does give us an idea of what the ancestor of wombats probably looked like in terms of its teeth and skeleton,” said Beck. One conclusion, he said, was that this common ancestor was probably a digger, since Mukupirna – and wombats – show adaptations for the task.Beck said the molars of Mukupirna were not capable of growing throughout life as seen in modern wombats. However, its teeth show features that fall between those of wombats and another, previously known, group of early vombatiforms called wynyardiids, shedding further light on the common ancestor of Mukupirna and wombats.“Mukupirna probably evolved from a wynyardiid-like common ancestor that it shares with wombats,” said Beck.The evolutionary family tree also revealed very large body sizes, more than 100kg, evolved independently at least six times among vombatiforms. However, the common ancestor of all such creatures was probably only the size of today’s koalas. “From this small ancestor we have had multiple origins of large body size,” said Beck.“This will have quite a bit of impact on how we consider the evolution of the group, past ecosystems, and the ecology of these species that led to such significant changes in their body size over time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02486dc5728f45cf799c293af31a4c6c21da341b/0_192_7195_4319/master/7195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49894a92a1502c27e2042b7a35b2e068","title":"my online art classes helped people switch off how creativity became a lifeline in lockdown","story":"Art-shop owner Barry Whitehouse tells how he went from having no website to running virtual art classes for his local students – now, they’re joined by people from all over the worldIt may be packed into a small space, but The Artery is full of everything you would ever need to get creative. The Banbury shop is an art lover’s paradise, full of watercolour brushes, lino sets, calligraphy pens and more. Upstairs there is a classroom where owner Barry Whitehouse delivers art classes for up to eight students.“My customers range from complete beginners to professional artists and my passion is to make art accessible and affordable to everyone,” says Whitehouse. “I know all my customers by name and many are retired or ‘recycled teenagers’ as I like to call them. It is wonderful to see the positive effects learning art has, such as mindfulness, confidence building and creating communities.”In January this year, The Artery celebrated its 10th year of trading and had been going from strength to strength. Forty different classes were available in the studio space at £12 each, plus there were strong sales from the shop. Whitehouse was also heavily involved in organising community events such as the Banbury art festival.But then Covid-19 hit and by late February he was seeing the effects.“Revenue dropped and so did footfall. My older students started cancelling classes due to health concerns. I needed a new business plan and fast because at that stage I didn’t even have an online shop,” he says.In March, he was forced to close his beloved shop and put his two part-time staff on furlough. Stuck at home like everyone else, Whitehouse started experimenting with streaming his classes online direct from his dining room via closed Facebook groups. The camera was trained on his easel and he offered step-by-step instructions just as he did in the real-life classes.“Those first few weeks were about getting my older students used to new technology,” he says. “For some, my classes were the only outside contact they got all week. It became a special time where they could connect and switch off from the stress of Covid-19 for a couple of hours.”Whitehouse charged a flat rate of £5 a class and by April had seven weekly classes available, covering watercolour, acrylics, drawing, and calligraphy. Initially the clientele were mostly current students but then he started to up his social media presence.He began by offering the occasional free paint-along sessions on the Artery Facebook page. To date those six sessions have now had more than 12,000 views, with his class on painting a bluebell wood in watercolour proving particularly popular. This resulted in new students signing up to his online classes from all across the UK as well as the US, South Africa, Australia and Canada.“I have gone from around 50 students pre-lockdown to several hundred now,” he says. “Some classes have 40-plus people in them. The students have created their own community by sharing their work and words of encouragement.”Whitehouse has also brought his shop online for the first time via a ShopAppy account. You can buy both art supplies and classes here. He is now sending parcels across the UK and sales are especially strong for products such as the watercolour brushes that students need for classes.“I personally deliver all local orders either on foot or in my car and often have a socially distanced chat,” says Whitehouse. “My customers love buying from a small local shop. Support from brands like Visa has been invaluable in raising awareness on shopping local and falling in love with our town centres again.”But now it’s all change again with government news that shops can reopen from 15 June. For Whitehouse though, while he will open up the shutters, it will be far from business as usual.“As the shop is so small, you can only safely have one person in there at a time. We’re opening for click and collect to begin with to keep everyone safe.”And as for the classes, Whitehouse says he will offer them face-to-face again once he is allowed, but they will also always be streamed online too.“The students see the same image and get the same instructions. It has made the classes so much more accessible, plus the recordings can be watched whenever and as many times as needed.”So an unexpected bonus of Covid-19 is that The Artery is actually busier than ever.“I always thought I’d need a bigger bricks and mortar classroom to grow my business.

Willi Richards’s script does contain secrets, infidelities and lies, along with some witty one-liners, but it makes these well-worn generic tropes feel edgy and profound.At its centre is a gay love triangle featuring characters who are given epithets for names. Rupert Everett is Man, an older, urbane type who is in an unconventional relationship with Lad (Daniel Boyd), while Boy (Omari Douglas) is a millennial hairdresser who Lad meets on Grindr and finds immediately entrancing.The play, directed by Joseph Winters, had a brief run two years ago and was due to be staged at London’s Trafalgar Studios in June. Produced by Roger James Elsgood and Stephen Daldry, this is, unusually, a Zoom rehearsal with actors reading their parts for the first time from a script. It is remarkable that the performances gel so well, however static the setup. Each actor is convincing in his part, although Douglas – who was cast in the same role two years ago – is narrowly the strongest of the three.Points of tension in the men’s three-way romance are used to explore generational clash and the value of open relationships in comparison to monogamy, not unlike Sally Rooney’s Conversation With Friends, except this is a more head-on inquisition of partnerships in the context of queer identities.Man regards Boy’s fervent belief in monogamy as a yearning for heterosexual, nuclear family norms. “Your version of queer is surprisingly straight to me,” he says.A probing analysis of these issues is metabolised into the drama, which is full of intrigue and understated emotion alongside the social critique. We are kept guessing about which lover Lad will ultimately choose his 30-year open relationship with Man appears tender and true yet the ardour that Boy offers is beguiling, and we feel moments of pathos for both men.“What everyone wants now is monogamous bliss,” Lad says about the younger generation of gay men. The question that fires this piquant comedy is whether he does too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807fe7fbe81ad77545e9a9e6554887782bacab0b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aa7f50683726eeaae71aa7293efed7d","title":"qanon facebook conspiracy theories algorithm","story":" investigation finds more than 3m aggregate followers and members support QAnon on Facebook, and their numbers are growingIn early May, QAnon braced for a purge. Facebook had removed a small subset – five pages, six groups and 20 profiles – of the community on the social network, and as word of the bans spread, followers of Q began preparing for a broader sweep.Some groups changed their names, substituting “17” for “Q” (the 17th letter of the alphabet) others shared links to back-up accounts on alternative social media platforms with looser rules.More than just another internet conspiracy theory, QAnon is a movement of people who interpret as a kind of gospel the online messages of an anonymous figure – “Q” – who claims knowledge of a secret cabal of powerful pedophiles and sex traffickers. Within the constructed reality of QAnon, Donald Trump is secretly waging a patriotic crusade against these “deep state” child abusers, and a “Great Awakening” that will reveal the truth is on the horizon.QAnon evolved out of the baseless Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which posited that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring out of a Washington DC pizza restaurant, and has come to incorporate numerous strands of rightwing conspiracy mongering. Dedicated followers interpret Q’s cryptic messages in a kind of digital scavenger hunt. Despite the fact that Q’s prognostications have reliably failed to come true, followers rationalize the inaccuracies as part of a larger plan. Q’s initial commentary on the Facebook bans was concise: “Information Warfare,” Q posted on the website 8kun. Two days later, in a post that included a collage of dozens of news headlines about the takedowns, Q went further, speculating that there had been a “coordinated media roll-out designed to instill ‘fear’” in believers and dissuade them from discussing QAnon on social media. “When do you expend ammunition?” Q wrote. “For what purpose?”The anticipated purge never came. Instead, QAnon groups on Facebook have continued to grow at a considerable pace in the weeks following the takedown, with several adding more than 10,000 members over 30 days.These groups and pages play a critical role in disseminating Q’s messages to a broader audience and in recruiting more believers to the cult-like belief system, researchers say.“Facebook is a unique platform for recruitment and amplification,” said Brian Friedberg, a senior researcher at the Harvard Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change Project who has been studying QAnon for years. “I really do not think that QAnon as we know it today would have been able to happen without the affordances of Facebook.”Moreover, Facebook is not merely providing a platform to QAnon groups. Its powerful algorithms are actively recommending them to users who may not otherwise have been exposed to them. did not initially go looking for QAnon content on Facebook. Instead, Facebook’s algorithms recommended a QAnon group to a  reporter’s account after it had joined pro-Trump, anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown Facebook groups. The list of more than 100 QAnon groups and accounts was then generated by following Facebook’s recommendation algorithms and using simple keyword searches. The Instagram accounts were discovered by searching for “QAnon” in the app’s discovery page and then following Instagram’s algorithmic recommendations.Receiving QAnon recommendations from Facebook does not appear to be that uncommon. “Once I started liking those pages and joining those groups, Facebook just started recommending more and more and more and more, to the point where I was afraid to like them all in case Facebook would flag me as a bot,” said Friedberg. Erin Gallagher, a researcher who studies social media extremism, said she was also encouraged to join a QAnon group by Facebook, soon after joining an anti-lockdown group.Facebook did not directly respond to questions from the  about its policy considerations around QAnon content. “Last month, we took down accounts, Groups, and Pages tied to this conspiracy theorist movement for violating our policies,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “We also remove Groups and Pages that violate other policies from recommendations and demote in search results. We’re closely monitoring this activity and how our policies apply.”The company also claimed that “all of the Pages” and “the vast majority of Groups” documented by the  had been removed from recommendation algorithms prior to the ’s query. The company did not provide evidence for this claim, which is contradicted by screenshots of pages and groups appearing in recommendations that were taken in May.  also continued to receive recommendations to join additional QAnon groups after its initial query to Facebook.Asked about this discrepancy, Facebook said that the pages and groups in question had been marked as “non-recommendable” as of 8 April 2020 for violations of policies against clickbait, viral misinformation and hate speech, but that a page or group can be restored to eligibility for recommendations if its behavior improves for several months.To Friedberg, the window for Facebook to act on QAnon may have already passed. “I’m starting to wonder if we’re just waiting for the next shoe to drop – another act of violence,” he said. “That seems to be what the platforms wait for, and that in and of itself is terrifying.”While QAnon thrives on Facebook, another social media site took timely and decisive action against it. Nearly two years ago, Reddit, the link-sharing network of interest-based message boards, carried out a site-wide purge of QAnon – and made it stick.Reddit had been central to the development of the QAnon movement, which began in October 2017 with the emergence of “Q” on 4chan, the anarchic image board that has served as a launching pad for memes and internet culture but also racist extremism and harassment campaigns. Q, whose cryptic messages and predictions claimed to be based on a high-level government security clearance, quickly decamped from 4chan to the even more extreme 8chan, where believers could read Q’s latest “crumbs” directly from the source.Q went briefly silent in 2019 when 8chan was forced offline in the wake of the El Paso massacre, but re-emerged on the new site founded by 8chan’s owners, 8kun.Anonymous internet posters claiming to be high-level government officials are not entirely uncommon in recent years, other so-called “anons” have emerged with claims that they were revealing secrets from inside the FBI or CIA. But Q is the first such figure to have achieved such a broad audience and real-world political influence. This is largely due to the activism of three dedicated conspiracy theorists who latched on to Q’s posts in the early days, according to an investigation by NBC News. These activists worked to develop a mythology and culture around QAnon and cultivated an audience for it on mainstream social media platforms. Reddit was significantly easier to use for the kind of crowd-sourced research and interpretation that forms the core of participation in QAnon, and the site was host to a large pool of potential recruits, such as the 1.2m members of the subreddit rconspiracy. It had also long enjoyed and at times even earned a reputation as one of the danker cesspools of the social web, for years tolerating communities known as “subreddits” dedicated to sharing non-consensual sexualized images of women or advocating rape.But the violent anger of adherents to QAnon crossed the line for Reddit in less than a year. On 12 September 2018, citing its ban on content that “incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses”, the company banned 18 QAnon subreddits, the largest of which had more than 70,000 members.Social media bans are often difficult to maintain, but Reddit’s move was uncommonly effective. Today, QAnon remains unwelcome on Reddit, with the few subreddits that address it dedicated to either debunking the theory or providing support to people who have lost friends and family members to QAnon.QAnon did not disappear after Reddit pulled the plug, however. Instead, its believers moved on to other platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, Discord and – crucially – Facebook. At the time of the Reddit ban, one of the largest closed Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon, “Qanon Follow the White Rabbit” had 51,000 members, according to NBC News. Today that group has grown to more than 90,000 members.And while YouTube and Twitter have played an important role in providing a broadcast platform for QAnon content, the specific structures provided by Facebook are uniquely suited to the participatory “work” of engaging with QAnon. Facebook also provides QAnon with an even larger pool of potential recruits than Reddit could, especially for the somewhat older, Evangelical crowd that has proven susceptible to QAnon’s messaging.Will Partin, a research analyst with Data \u0026amp Society, and Alice Marwick, a professor of communication at the University of North Carolina, describe QAnon as a “dark participatory culture”, which is to say that it is a community that takes advantage of the infrastructure of social networking sites to bring disparate people together and foster discussion, collaboration, research and community, but directs those energies toward anti-democratic, regressive and even violent ends.“Everything about our research suggests that these people are not irrational they’re hyper-literate, even if they’ve come to beliefs that are empirically inaccurate ,” Partin said. “That’s partly because they have a fundamentally different epistemology to judge what is true and false.”The digital architecture of Facebook groups is also particularly well-suited to QAnon’s collaborative construction of an alternative body of knowledge, Friedberg said. The platform has created a ready-made digital pathway from public pages to public groups to private groups and finally secret groups that mirrors the process of “falling down the rabbit hole or taking the red pill”.“You can mechanically take those steps,” he said. “Very few of the contemporary Q-following base actually need to engage with 8chan at all.”While Facebook has policies banning hate speech, incitement to violence and other types of content that it considers undesirable on a family- and advertiser-friendly platform, QAnon does not fit neatly into any single category.Much of what is shared in QAnon groups on Facebook is a mix of pro-Trump political speech and pro-Trump political misinformation. Memes, videos and posts are often bigoted and disconnected from reality, but not all that different from the content that is shared in non-QAnon, pro-Trump Facebook groups.The pages and groups that were removed in early May violated the company’s ban on “coordinated inauthentic behavior” – ie the kind of digital astroturf tactics that Russian operatives used to support Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. Those rules are aimed at operations in which actors make false representations about their identities in order to mislead people – a description that could encompass Q – but Facebook only applies its policy to deceptive behavior that occurs on its platform, not on 8kun.To enact a blanket ban akin to Reddit’s under its current rubric of rules, Facebook would likely have to designate QAnon as a “dangerous organization” – the category it uses to ban both terrorist and hate groups and any content published in support or praise of them. QAnon is hardly an organization, though as a movement it has certainly caused harm and could be considered dangerous.There are innate societal and inidual harms to convincing people of a version of reality that is simply false, as QAnon does, said Data \u0026amp Society research analyst Will Partin. “When a common sense of what is real and what is correct breaks apart, it becomes nearly impossible to reach a democratic consensus.”And QAnon followers’ enthusiasm for misinformation is not confined to politics as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, the groups became a hotbed for medical misinformation – something Facebook has claimed to be working hard to combat. Analyses by Gallagher, the social media researcher, and the New York Times demonstrated how QAnon groups fueled the viral spread of “Plandemic”, a 26-minute video chock full of dangerously false information about Covid-19 and vaccines.Facebook’s algorithms appear to have detected this synergy between the QAnon and anti-vaccine communities. Several QAnon groups are flagged with an automated warning label from Facebook that reads, “This group discusses vaccines” and encourages users to go to the website of the Centers for Disease Control for reliable information on health.It appears that anti-vaccine propagandists are also taking notice, and attempting to capitalize. Larry Cook, the administrator of Stop Mandatory Vaccination, one of the largest anti-vaxx Facebook groups, has begun incorporating QAnon rhetoric into the medical misinformation he peddles, as well as making explicit invitations to QAnon believers to join his group.Cook has begun referencing the “deep state” and stoking fear of forced vaccination and “FEMA camps”.“I have discussed the concept many, many, many times that vaccines destroy our connection to God and that we are in a spiritual war with Principalities of Darkness that have a death wish for our children, and humanity at large,” he wrote in one QAnon-inflected post. (Cook also uses the site to aggressively promote his various products and a subscription-only platform for “medical freedom patriots”.)But the potential for damage from QAnon goes well beyond. For those iniduals who truly believe in the QAnon narrative, the crimes of the “cabal” are so grievous as to make fighting them a moral imperative. “They’re talking about a group of people who are operating our government against our wishes and they’re molesting and torturing children and destroying our society,” said Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science who studies conspiracy theories. “It’s an incitement to violence.”Indeed, there have been numerous incidents of real-world violence linked to QAnon, and in May 2019, the FBI identified QAnon as a potential domestic terrorism threat in an intelligence bulletin. While anti-government conspiracy theories were not new, the bulletin stated, social media was allowing them to reach a larger audience, and the online narratives were determining the targets of harassment and violence for the small subset of iniduals who crossed over into real-world action.Despite this, Uscinski is skeptical of the idea that kicking QAnon off Facebook would help anyone. He regularly polls conspiracy theories and consistently finds that QAnon is “one of the least believed things” out there, well below belief in theories about Jeffrey Epstein’s death, anti-vaccine hoaxes, and Holocaust denialism. Uscinski also cautions against overly exoticizing the QAnon narrative, noting that “most of the component parts of QAnon have been around forever”, with parallels in the Satanic Panic of the 1980s or the plot of Oliver Stone’s JFK. And he’s concerned about the free speech implications of censorship by tech platforms.“It’s a potentially dangerous belief it’s very disconnected from reality I don’t really think we want more people getting into it,” he said of QAnon. “Do the internet companies bear some responsibility? Yes. Would it be better if they took it down? Probably. Does that take care of it? No.”Partin said that he generally favored Facebook taking a “more aggressive approach to moderation”, including addressing the recommendation algorithms and trying to reduce the spread of misinformation out of dedicated conspiracy communities and into the mainstream.“If Facebook flipped a switch and every Q post disappeared tomorrow, that probably would be harmful for QAnon,” he said. “But there is resiliency built in. Getting deplatformed is harmful, but the idea that it would somehow make this disappear is fanciful.”In May, Republican voters in Oregon nominated a QAnon believer to run for the US Senate in November. Another QAnon supporter, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is likely to be elected to the House of Representatives after she came first in a Republican primary in a conservative Georgia district on 11 June.“In some ways, the second that Trump officially acknowledges QAnon is the second it becomes a partisan political issue that Facebook may not be able to take action against,” said Friedberg. “We’re watching a normalization process of these conspiracies, and I think the beast that is Facebook was really the answer to this all along.”Indeed, Trump himself has repeatedly retweeted QAnon accounts on Twitter, which believers take as confirmation of their alternate reality. And on 20 June, just before Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump’s adult son Eric posted a QAnon meme on his Instagram account. Eric Trump deleted the image relatively quickly, but not before screenshots spread across the Facebook Q-sphere.“So Eric Trump posted a pic with a ‘Q’ in the imagery,” an administrator of one of the larger QAnon groups wrote. “The pic has been taken down but the message was received!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceae7912d683b62b4477b8563ff13b63959c09f1/395_567_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96580e84de31c0e91f19ddf92788c773","title":"withings sleep analyzer review advanced sleep tracking made easy","story":"Track sleep, heart rate, snoring and even sleep apnoea with a zero-maintenance mat you stick under your mattressSleep tracking has become an important piece of total wellness monitoring, but typically requires strapping devices to your wrist or head. Withings Sleep Analyzer records your sleep and heart rate, plus is one of the first devices to monitor sleep apnoea, all without you needing to attach anything to your person.Instead, the £120 Sleep Analyzer is a sensor-packed slim mat that you slide under your mattress. Once it’s there you simply go to sleep as normal.The mat is 637mm long, 190mm wide and only 5mm thick, so easily slides between your mattress and base (including slatted bases), positioned around where your chest lies. It tracks your breathing, heart rate and movement with a pneumatic sensor, and your snoring and sleep apnoea with a sound sensor. It then syncs the data via wifi to your Withings account and the accompanying Health Mate app when you get up.Set up is simple using Health Mate on iOS or Android. Put the mat in place, plug it in, find the mat via Bluetooth in the app and then wait for it to inflate and calibrate. The process takes about five minutes.You can’t feel it in bed and can barely see it, as just a thin USB power cable pokes out from under your mattress, which plugs into an adapter. The cable is long enough to stretch to the nearest plug, even if it’s on the other side of the bed.The tracking is automatic, so all you have to do is get into bed and sleep as you usually would, which is the beauty of the Sleep Analyzer system. You can completely forget about it and just pick up your data when you need it.Your data is securely synced and stored in your Withings account, but can be synced from there with other apps and combined with fitness data such as steps from Google Fit and Apple Health, among others.You get a colour-coded graph showing your periods of being awake, in light, deep and REM (when you dream) sleep over time, an overall sleep score each night out of 100 and a rating in words, such as “restful night”. But you also get data broken down into sections including duration, depth, regularity, the number of times your sleep has been interrupted, the time it took you to go to sleep and the time it took you to get up after waking.Each section has a traffic light system: green dot for good, orange for average and red if it’s been a bad night. They can be expanded for more information, too, such as a range of what was good and bad, comparisons with previous nights and some simple advice.Those are the basics of most sleep trackers and the Withings matches the data from various other wrist-borne sleep trackers including Garmin and Samsung watches pretty well. The Health Mate app presents the data in a way that makes it fairly easy to follow what happened overnight, and gives an average of sleep scores and sleep time over the last week or month. What it doesn’t do is provide much in the way of guidance on how to improve your sleep beyond the most obvious things, such as maintaining regular hours, keeping noises to a minimum in the bedroom and the temperature low.Beyond basic sleep stats, the Sleep Analyzer also measures your sleeping heart rate, with an accuracy matching wrist-borne heart rate monitors, as a good measure of overall health: the lower the better to a point.You can see a chart of your heart rate for the night, but also see the trend over the last quarter. My average sleep heart rate has decreased by two beats a minute over the last quarter, for instance. Here Withings has more advice covering health, fitness, diet and other bits, which can help you find out why your sleeping heart rate might be high.You can also spot things in your own charts. I can see, for instance, when I’ve been ill as my sleeping heart rate is higher than normal across the full night, or when I’ve drunk alcohol in the evening as my heart rate starts higher then tapers back down to normal as the night progresses.The Sleep Analyzer’s killer feature, which few other devices can offer, is tracking of sleep apnoea, something Withings recently got regulatory approval in the EU to implement.Sleep apnoea is a condition where breathing becomes more difficult when you’re asleep due to the relaxation of the muscles in your throat, which can lead to you to stop breathing. The result is a disturbed sleep where you’re often jolted at least partially awake to breathe again.For many this may happen occasionally in the night, but for some it can happen as much as 20 times an hour, which does your sleep no good at all. Many may be completely oblivious this is happening too.Each night the Sleep Analyzer watches for signs of sleep apnoea, recording events as well as snoring, which can be a precursor. The data is then presented to you on a sliding scale of normal to mild, moderate and severe. My highest over the last couple of months has been 11 events an hour, which was rated as normal to mild, but most nights are symptomless. I also don’t snore very often, but when I have the tracker has picked it up reliably.You can view your data over the last day, quarter or year, to keep an eye on it. But if the tracker detects enough sleep apnoea events it will recommend a couple of tests to estimate your risk, give you guidance on the symptoms, advice on how to improve things and lets you share a report with your doctor should medical help be needed.It’s worth noting that some wrist-borne fitness trackers with blood oxygen sensors can also track sleep apnoea events by measuring the dip in oxygen in your blood associated with them.The Withings Sleep Analyzer is a sleep tracking mat that’s simply easy to live with. Stick it under your mattress and go to sleep. It works automatically. You can’t feel it, nor do you have to wear or charge anything.The data it produces is good and the way it’s presented in the excellent Health Mate app is easy to follow and track across days, weeks or quarters. Sleep heart rate data is interesting and the ability to track both snoring and sleep apnoea without having to wear anything is the mat’s killer feature.The app provides some good information around heart rate and sleep apnoea, what it means and how to improve it, but it could do with some more effective guidance on how to turn around a trend of bad sleep, rather than letting the user work it out from graphs and stats.With sleep tracking built into many wearables, you might wonder why you need a purpose-built gadget for it. Really the Sleep Analyzer is for those who, like me, don’t like wearing devices or watches overnight. It’s not cheap, but the Withings Sleep Analyzer works great with the minimum of fuss if you want to track your sleep.Pros: comprehensive sleep tracking, nothing to wear, very easy to live with, fits most beds, tracks heart rate, monitors sleep apnoea, syncs over wifiCons: expensive, guidance on how to improve sleep could be better This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The public is not disciplined or wearing masks,” Sigal Sadetzky, the head of public health services at Israel’s health ministry, told the Times of Israel.“There is an increase in the number of new patients and I am worried. We are still protecting the elderly and the populations at risk more than the rest, but it can never be totally effective,” Sadetzky said.With 532 new infections reported by the health ministry in the past 24 hours, Israel has seen the emergence of a number of hotspots including in the Sea of Galilee resort of Tiberias, as well as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem – the highest daily total in more than two months.As of Thursday morning, the number of coronavirus cases had hit 22,139 since the beginning of the outbreak, with 49 in serious condition and 29 on ventilators, and 500 new cases being reported every day.Cases also appeared to be rising in the occupied territories where the Palestinian Authority has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in all mosques across the West Bank.On Wednesday night, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, voted to approve a bill authorising Shin Bet to track coronavirus cases and those in contact with them.While some of the new clusters appear to be linked to schools, a significant number of cases in the country’s second peak appear to be affecting the under-40s, meaning the rise in infections has not been matched by a similar rise in fatalities.Among places recording a surge in new cases were the southern city of Ashdod, which recorded a steep hike in new virus cases, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the town of Elad, which has been put under lockdown.Since the beginning of the week, 1,392 new infections have been reported – more than the number of infections recorded during the entire month of May.The surge in cases follows the marked loosening of social restrictions, with the cabinet approval of gatherings for weddings and funerals of up to 250 people – a move the director general of health ministry, Chezy Levy, said might have to be reconsidered.“Additional restrictions are on the table for discussion, such as whether we take a step back in the area of events held in halls,” Levy told Army Radio. “Weddings may have to be smaller, if there is no choice.”Health officials forecast a sharp rise in the coming days, with as many as 1,000 new daily cases expected within just five days.Sadetzky told Channel 12 those involved in tracing the virus spread were “collapsing”. But she said she was confident the virus could be contained without reimposing another nationwide lockdown.The defence minister, Benny Gantz, ordered the Israel Defence Forces home front command to open additional hotels for coronavirus patients. The army is currently running six facilities for those infected and people who cannot adequately self-isolate at home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f23d53631c038fdef27feeaf8bf666c1ae35e6b/0_263_5034_3022/master/5034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79684eec727cd7d7b4848c9fc1d0162c","title":"lorry drivers from outside eu exploited in lockdown delivery surge","story":"A new business model seems to be taking hold in a logistics system under huge strainAt dusk one day this month, dozens of lorries registered in Lithuania, Poland and Romania were packed like giant sardines just off the M25.

He said he would be paid just €63 (£57) for the leg of the trip from France to the UK.A huge boom in internet ordering during the Covid-19 shutdown has created a surge in demand for contractors to move goods between e-commerce fulfilment centres. The pandemic has put huge strain on the global logistics system and resulted in an increase in the exploitation of non-EU drivers such as Yuri.That is is the conclusion of a report by the Dutch trade union research foundation VNB, the International Transport Federation (ITF) and the International Union of Food Workers, whose investigators have spent months interviewing hundreds of drivers during the pandemic.“Long before covid, the road transport industry in Europe was plagued by exploitation of drivers and human rights abuses,” said the general secretary of the ITF, Stephen Cotton. “The pandemic has exacerbated the abuse.”While much of Europe has been in lockdown, drivers interviewed by the VNB have been crossing the continent for leading multinational companies and brands, either employed by small subcontractors at the bottom of complex supply chains, or working directly for some of the biggest transport companies in Europe.The story of Yuri, who asked the  not to use his real name for fear of retribution from his employer, which owes him money, echoes those of other HGV drivers and suggests a new business model is increasingly taking hold in the sector.It involves haulage companies establishing their legal base in lower-wage areas of the EU, such as Lithuania or Poland, then recruiting drivers from even poorer countries outside the EU, such as Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Turkey and the Philippines.The drivers, enticed by promises of quick access to EU visas and generous salaries of around €2,000 a month, pay agents up to €1,000 for their jobs. They are then brought in minibuses from the east to drive lorries almost entirely in higher-wage countries in western Europe. The good salaries mostly fail to materialise, according to the union report.Some Filipino drivers, contracted in Poland, told the union they had not been paid at all while driving in western Europe during the pandemic. Others were earning as little as nine cents per kilometre driven. The report also sheds light on lax inspections and enforcement.The unions have found cases of false documentation supplied to some drivers to cheat auditors or mislead authorities if they are stopped and inspected. They have also received repeated allegations that some companies cheat the tachograph, the instrument in each truck that is supposed to record the driver’s location, working and rest times to safeguard the public.In order to prove how easy it is to obtain false documentation in Ukraine, for example, the VNB union successfully obtained a photo driving licence in the country using the name of Angela Merkel and an image of the German chancellor.Yuri was contracted to a Lithuanian-registered haulage company. He said he had not had a proper rest period away from his truck as required by EU law for weeks. His company had said it could no longer afford to pay for overnight accommodation, so he was living in his truck 247. He was not only trucking to Amazon locations but also to other companies in western Europe.“Tramping”, as the haulage industry calls it, is not necessarily illegal. HGV trucks are fitted with bunk beds behind the driver’s seat and drivers may sleep in them overnight. But the EU has strict rules on working and resting hours, and living in the cabin week after week is illegal.The number of hours a driver can work without proper rest is also strictly regulated, to protect from dangerous driver fatigue. But Yuri said on his most recent run he worked 94 hours over two weeks, over the legal maximum. EU rules say drivers must have at least 11 consecutive hours rest in every 24 Yuri said he was repeatedly working 14-hour days.Regulations also require drivers to be paid the minimum wages of the countries in which they actually spend their time working. But with much of the haulage industry’s usual work delivering to manufacturers having disappeared, competition between companies has become fiercer. Transport companies bid for work from well-known multinationals, then subcontract to other hauliers, who undercut others by employing non-EU drivers on illegal wages and conditions, the unions say.Like other Ukrainian and Belarusian drivers to whom the  talked, Yuri mostly cooked with a gas stove inside his trailer, or just beside it. He goes a week at a time without proper facilities for showering. “It’s hard to work like this when you haven’t seen your family for months.” His contract promised him the Lithuanian minimum wage plus a premium, and daily allowances, so that he expected to be getting between €700-1,000 a month. To date he said he had only ever received small amounts of money from the company of between €300-400 a month.Amazon said it was unable to investigate allegations without more details about the case. “We work with a variety of haulier partners to get packages around our logistics network and these anonymous allegations in no way reflect the high standards we hold our partners to. All partners are required to comply with applicable laws and Amazon’s supplier code of conduct, which focuses on fair wages, benefits, appropriate working hours and compensation. We expect our partners to provide a great work experience and take immediate action if we find a partner is not complying with that expectation.”Driving across Europe, non-EU drivers also get a feel for which countries have more rigorous checks and enforcement. France, Germany and Austria were known to be places where you might be stopped and fined for excessive driving hours, Yuri said, but not so much the UK, which he believed “closes its eyes”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69026710dfd3537362d1955c172cbe949cbd7c83/0_584_2301_1381/master/2301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b91202a1a86403d9b0cfbe577d9f235","title":"macron promise to reinvent himself may not save his presidency","story":"The French president is facing a barrage of criticism from voters and colleagues. Will a leftward turn be enough?France should be proud of what its people – and government – have achieved in the battle against the coronavirus, Emmanuel Macron told the nation in his most recent address. Unfortunately, the nation seems in no particular mood to listen.With two years of his five-year term left, the 42-year-old French president’s agenda of economic and social reform – aimed at spurring growth, creating jobs and deregulating the economy – has been thrown badly off track by Covid-19.He is also battling a critical, if not outright hostile, French public an anticipated avalanche of dreadful local election results on 28 June and ever more evident splits in the centrist La République en Marche (LREM) movement that he led to sweeping presidential and parliamentary victories in 2017.Despite undeniable blunders, France has, by most measures, handled the pandemic reasonably well – and better than comparable neighbours such as Spain, Italy and Britain (although not, importantly for French voters, Germany).The country should probably have imposed its mandatory lockdown several days earlier than it did, on 16 March, and should certainly have been more honest about an early shortage of masks – and more energetic in building up testing capacity.But France contained the virus largely to the greater Paris region and the north-east was quick to propose a generous €500bn (£450m) aid package for businesses that has protected more than 11 million employees and has managed its exit from lockdown smoothly.The number of new infections has fallen steadily, to a recent seven-day average of about 450, compared with 4,500 in late March. Daily deaths have followed a similar curve since a peak of nearly 1,500 on 15 April and now average about 35. Cinemas, and all schools for the under-16s, opened again on Monday.“We have nothing to be ashamed of,” Macron said in his address on 14 June. “In how many countries was all this done? That’s fortunate and it shows the strength of our state and our social model. We can be proud of what was done and of our country.”But French voters, almost always more critical of their rulers than most, are not buying it – or Macron.The president’s ailing popularity has many causes besides his perceived errors in handling Covid-19. Having blown up France’s political landscape, crushing the main centre-left and centre-right parties on his way to the Élysée, he has no established tribe on which he can rely to back him come what may.Strongly partisan voters on both left and right loathe Macron with real passion. While he still retains the reasoned support of many in the centre, polls show a clear majority of voters, despite his recent efforts to appear more relatable, continue to see him as aloof and imperious.His LREM movement, meanwhile, is struggling to transition from raw political startup to functioning party machine. Last month, 17 MPs – mainly disgruntled former Macron supporters who believe the party, contrary to its pledge to be “neither left nor right”, is distinctly more right than left – formed a new parliamentary group.Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity is not formally part of the opposition, but has warned it will vote against the government if it feels it warranted. The move cost LREM its absolute majority and was a significant symbolic blow, even if the party still has a comfortable working majority thanks to other centrists in parliament.Nor will the second round of France’s local elections, delayed by the pandemic, provide much encouragement. In Paris, the Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is on course for re-election after a disastrous LREM campaign elsewhere, one-time Macron allies face excommunication after sealing electoral pacts with rivals.For these reasons and more – even if an early Ifop poll this week saw him winning the 2022 election by 10 points against the far-right leader, Marine Le Pen – Macron’s presidency is in need of a reboot. He is uncomfortably aware that both his immediate predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, were ejected from office after a single term.Macron has promised to “reinvent” himself – and present a detailed plan for the final two years of his mandate – next month. With the positive impact of some initial reforms (such as 800,000 new jobs) set to be mostly wiped out by Covid-19, most observers assume that this will entail at least the appearance of a shift to the left.The president signalled this in his 14 June address, promising a “new path” for the second half of his mandate, heavy on greener economic policies, more social solidarity and a greater emphasis on national production. “Our first priority will be to rebuild an economy that is strong, ecological, sovereign and united,” he said, but also “founded on hard work”.Acknowledging the crisis had “exposed our shortcomings and weaknesses, our dependence on others for certain products, our organisational handicaps,” he promised “massive investment” in education, greater “technological, digital, industrial and agricultural independence” and more power to local authorities.Since it is standard practice for French presidents to sack their prime ministers to mark a fresh start, an early victim of the administration’s expected step-change could be his loyal prime minister, Édouard Philippe, a conservative who never joined LREM and is, for most French voters, clearly associated more with the right than the left.So, Macron faces a dilemma: replace a credible, well-liked prime minister (and possibly create a future rival) or risk being eclipsed as he struggles to chart a more caring, eco-friendly, post-coronavirus course in the run-up to 2022. It is not the biggest decision the president faces, but it could be one of the more significant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31bb4a39a7f491ff17d9ad4d7179745bf28444e7/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24bc9dbecf8c6aff4f908fd0e4fb9b79","title":"major incident declared as people flock to england south coast","story":"Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council says services are ‘completely overstretched’ as visitors defy advice to stay awayA major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast.The local authority, BCP council – covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole – said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle issues ranging from overcrowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams.The Bournemouth East MP, Tobias Ellwood, said half a million people had flocked to the beaches and said the situation was so overwhelming that the UK government should step in to help the council deal with the crisis.He said: “A lot of people have chosen to be not just irresponsible but dangerous. We’ve made such progress tackling this pandemic. I’d hate to see Bournemouth be the one place in Britain that gets that second spike.”“The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.“The numbers of people descending down here are like those seen on a bank holiday. We are not in a position to welcome visitors in these numbers now. Please do not come.”The council said services were left “completely overstretched” as visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9am on Thursday. BCP council issued 558 parking enforcement fines within a few hours – the highest ever. Families had travelled from as far afield as London and Birmingham to the beaches in Dorset.People queued for 30 minutes at ice-cream vans and refreshment stalls on the promenade as a police helicopter hovered overhead. At one point a dozen police officers and security guards stepped in as tempers briefly flared between two sets of teenagers.Phil Horton, 57, from Bournemouth, who works in the timber trade, said: “The number of people here makes me very nervous, and there’s absolutely no respect for social distancing. It seems like everyone has forgotten we are living in a pandemic.“What can the police do about it? There’s thousands and thousands of people here so they’re massively outnumbered. Good luck telling them to go home.”Rickie Inskip, a sports therapist, unfurled a banner reading: “Don’t be mean, keep the beach clean.” He used a siren and megaphone to get the attention of the beach and told them: “We love the fact you come to our beach but please don’t leave your rubbish because it was in a disgusting state last night. We urge you to keep the beach clean.”The council said refuse crews suffered abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront. Security was put in place to protect them as they collected more than 40 tonnes of rubbish.Extra police patrols were put on. Sam de Reya, Dorset police assistant chief constable, said: “These are unprecedented times and we are urging people to stay away from the area of Bournemouth beach and other Dorset beaches.“The declaration of a major incident allows us to bring agencies together so we can take actions available to us to safeguard the public as much as possible.“We are also reliant on people taking personal responsibility and strongly advise members of the public to think twice before heading to the area. Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and such a significant volume of people heading to one area places a further strain on emergency services resources.”Tobias Ellwood said it was a pity the government’s daily Covid-19 briefings had been halted as these could be a way of getting out quick, clear messages when issues like this crop up. He also said warning signs should be set up on the main roads and railway stations to warn people that the resort was already full.He said: “Bournemouth is deluged with visitors and the local authority cannot cope. We have the perfect storm of incredible weather and a liberation of some Covid-19 guidelines and given the wider consequences of a second spike, the government needs to offer assistance and respond to this dangerous event.“When you have mass demonstrations in London the politan police can call on other forces to help and I think this is what needs to happen here. The police locally are overwhelmed, they cannot be everywhere.”Stephen Allen, a resident of Sandbanks, said: “It is the illegal camping that gets us. You see people coming out of their tents in their pyjamas and head off into the sand tunes with toilet roll. It is very unpleasant.“There has been illegal parking happening all over the place. Cars have parked on cycle lanes, double yellow lines and on the pavements. They would happily take a £35 parking fine rather than queue for hours on end.”Along the Dorset coast at Lulworth, Cllr Laura Miller told of the abuse she received when she tried to turn people away. She said: “I have been shouted and sworn at and one guy spat at me.“These are people who have travelled three or four hours in their car, they are hot and grumpy and then they are turned away. Some drivers have ignored our barriers and just knocked them over and driven through.”Police officers also seized music equipment and arrested five people at Formby beach on Wednesday afternoon after young people collected on the sand dunes.Merseyside police said five people were arrested for various offences including drunk and disorderly behaviour and possession of drugs, and a speaker and music equipment were seized.Police remained at Formby beach, as well as Ainsdale and Crosby beaches, parks and beauty spots including Formby nature reserve, on foot, in vehicles and on quad bikes.Ch Insp Andy Rankine said: “While we want everyone to enjoy themselves, antisocial behaviour and criminality will not be tolerated and Merseyside police will take action where necessary.”The local authority and police in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, continued to monitor the numbers at its beach.Cllr Ian Gilbert, leader of the borough council, said: “We are aware of the situation in Bournemouth. Although we are very busy and have our own challenges to deal with including antisocial behaviour and littering, we are not currently at a stage where we need to announce a major incident. However, we are keeping everything under constant review, and liaising regularly with our partners in emergency services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b5187d0a5ef0c9764d461edaeb04b0a4a4a913/0_0_7557_4533/master/7557.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5c1418a9fe5e1318102afa0ffc4c758a","title":"podcasting to blogging five tips to help marginalised voices find their platform","story":"In a world where everyone has an opinion, how do you make sure your views see the limelight, especially when it seems that no one is listening? Here, three people who found their voices explain how you can do itIt should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you’re on the margins? As part of Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign,  Labs talked to three young people who, driven by a burning desire to be heard, found their voices through blogging, podcasts and zines.This is their advice to others who are bubbling with ideas and opinions, who know they have something valuable to say, but may feel unchampioned or underestimated. These are the first steps to getting your voice heard ...1. Stay true to yourselfYou might admire a particular columnist or an influencer, but the world doesn’t need an exact copy of someone else. The world needs you.“I tried lots of voices on for size, but they weren’t really me,” says Jessica Riches, a social media and content specialist. She found her real voice and honed her social media skills during the student protests of 2010 when she became the clearest online voice of the group who occupied University College London in protest at increases in fees.“Politics was where I found myself,” she says. “I was able to learn and explore that side of myself and I found a community of people.”For Raifa Rafiq, a shared interest in books led her to create the Mostly Lit podcast with her friend Alex Reads. “The response we got was phenomenal,” she says of the podcast, which ran for four years, won awards and partnered with Waterstones. “We did something we enjoyed and ended up putting a different face on culture and arts criticism: you don’t have to be an old white man or a middle class white woman to love books or to talk about them.”2. Consider your platform carefullyWho do you want to reach and what are you trying to say? Both of these questions will have an effect on where and how you publish your work. “In terms of social media, this is key,” says Riches. “If you are telling a story that is text based, about news or opinion, then head to Twitter. If you want to draw people in with visuals, use Instagram. This sounds really obvious, but the mistake people often make at the beginning is over-committing. Pick the most appropriate platform and start there, that way you won’t end up disappointing yourself. You can always expand later.”Kirsty Fife has published her work on blogs and also created physical fanzines. “I started out blogging, I ran a fat-fashion blog, Fatty Unbound,” she says. “Blogging did create a space that wasn’t there at the time.” Digitally, she honed her writing and found a community, but decided to begin putting out fanzines when her work became more personal.3. Start creating“Think about what you engage with, what stops your thumb in its endless scroll,” says Riches. “Then think about what’s missing. Write down – privately – what you want your content principles to be. What topics are you going to cover, what are your boundaries? What will you enjoy creating? It sounds limiting, but it’s very freeing it stops you trying to talk about everything at once.”Creating a fanzine, says Fife: “Is still very lo-fi. It’s a Sharpie, sketchbooks, pieces of paper. Although these days I scan everything into my computer and create PDFs to print and distribute. I don’t want any more incidents with things getting stuck in work photocopiers.”The DIY approach has also worked for Rafiq, whose new podcast This Thing Changed My Life launched this month. “Buy equipment and teach yourself,” she says. “Some editing software is free and it might seem scary, but it’s not. YouTube taught me everything, and I started recording in a day. It’s saved me so much time and money.”4. Believe in yourselfThe biggest barriers, however, often aren’t the practical ones. Why, you might think, would anyone want to hear from you?“It’s hard to put something out into the world,” says Fife. “I used to think that anything I made had to be perfectly finished and polished. It will never be perfect, so push through those feelings of anxiety. Put whatever you can out there, don’t wait for validation to start.”“There will always be someone for whom your work is meaningful.”5. Build your communityFife, Rafiq and Riches all agree they have found communities through their creative work. “I found both friends and collaborators,” says Fife.But it’s worth remembering that an audience won’t appear overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” says Riches. “And you need to put the work in. Start where you feel comfortable, ask your close friends to like what you’re doing, then expand to other friends. Build.”Riches also points out that finding a community and finding an audience are very closely linked. “Don’t forget that social media is supposed to be social,” she says. “Support other people in your field. Collaborate. Share. Showcase others and make connections.”Before starting to produce her own, Fife bought zines created by others. She recommends looking at zine distros – places that sell and distribute a number of different fanzines. “I go to Pen Fight Distro, Synchronise Witches Press and Vampire Hag. There will be a voice you enjoy out there.”Rafiq proved there was an audience for her work that had been ignored or discounted by much of the culture industry. “Young people do love the arts,” she says. “Arts criticism isn’t just an endeavour for Oxbridge grads. You can be from the inner city, you can be BAME and want this.”The effort is worth it, Fife says. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me over the years because they listened to my voice. I don’t have a professional background in writing, art or design, but I made things that meant something to others.”Use Your Voice ...At the heart of the Your Voice.

File photograph: Brian LawlessPAThe wearing of face coverings should be made mandatory in Irish supermarkets, an immunologist has said. Kingston Mills professor of experimental immunology at Trinity College Dublin, said the requirement to wear masks on public transport, expected to be signed off by the Government today, should also be extended to shops as Ireland eases coronavirus lockdown measures.“The requirement (face masks on public transport) should extend to supermarkets. I’ve read reports that it’s (compliance) 41 per cent, but I’ve been to the local supermarket and often I’m the only one wearing a mask. It’s more like five per cent,” he told Newstalk Breakfast . Meanwhile, the general secretary of the National Bus and Railworkers Union (NBRU), Dermot O’Leary has said he acknowledged outgoing Minister for Transport Shane Ross “is doing the right thing” by making face masks compulsory on public transport.Mr O’Leary told the same radio programme that he had made many complaints about Mr Ross over the years, but in this case he was optimistic that the Minister was doing something positive.However, Mr O’Leary expressed concern that while the wearing of face masks was going to be compulsory, there was still an issue with capacity.“Next Monday people will be returning to work, it’s going to be difficult, social distancing is going to present many challenges.”Mr O’Leary also said that it was going to be difficult to police the capacity issue and face masks, this was not a job that a bus driver or frontline staff on the rail network should have to deal with, he added.“The last thing we want is conflict between drivers and passengers or between passengers.”There is a role for the gardaí, the transport companies and the National Transport Authority, he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288163.1593063410!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland needs to rapidly upscale before second wave committee to hear","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Mallon, consultant in Infectious Diseases in St Monicas ward on the Nutley Wing for Covid-19 patients at St Vincents University Hospital. Photograph: Alan BetsonAn infectious diseases specialist will on Thursday warn the Oireachtas about a second wave of Covid-19 and call on the Government for greater healthcare investment over the coming weeks “to rapidly upscale in emergency department capacity and isolation room facilities in hospitals.”Professor Paddy Mallon, an infectious diseases consultant at St Vincent’s and UCD, will tell the Covid-19 special committee that a highly effective programme of rapid testing, contact tracing and community actions must become a priority “in maintaining our national biosecurity.”The medic will tell TDs that as society reopens, the public is handing back some responsibility for controlling the virus to the State and if the programme of testing and tracing “fails to work effectively, we risk losing the gains provided to us through the sacrifices of the Irish people.”“We are still in the midst of a national public health emergency and our citizens are at no less risk of severe illness and death if they contract Covid-19 infection now than they were back in March,” Prof Mallon will tell the Oireachtas committee.He will tell say that there is “a very narrow window of opportunity” to learn from the lessons of the first wave and that this time must be used “wisely to improve our infrastructure.”“Failure to learn, or delays in planning and resourcing for what is ahead, would not only be potentially negligent but would be a travesty to the memories of those who have died from Covid-19, some avoidably, during the first wave,” Prof Mallon will say in his opening statement.Medical specialistsHe will call for networks of medical specialists to be established operating regionally under a common governance structure to enable “scalable, rapid regional responses to both current and future threats as they arise and evolve” and the rapid implementation of national guidelines.The HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry will tell the committee that a critical project for a new model of contact tracing and testing that will operate for the next 18 months and beyond will run over the summer months with a target implementation date in late August.It will be “flexible for any potential surges” of the diseases that may come, he will say.School closures will have a “real risk of regression” for many vulnerable children with complex needs, the Department of Education has warned.At a meeting of the Covid-19 special committee on Thursday, a senior department official will say that the loss of the regular school routine, social interaction with friends, access to teachers and vital supports are presenting risk of harming the learning, the social and emotional development, and wellbeing of these children.There are about 14,000 children attending special schools or special classes with special or complex needs.Inclusion Ireland, the support group for children with disabilities, said its survey of members found that most parents are struggling to educate and support their vulnerable children at home.It says support from schools has been variable, from “excellent to almost non-existent”, while plans for a summer catch-up programme continues to exclude some cohorts of children with disabilities and has been characterised by “poor planning leaving schools and families frustrated and in the dark”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288338.1593083447!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a everything you need to know about mandatory face masks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople at a bus stop wearing face masks waiting for bus at Dame Street in Dublin.

Here, we run through everything you need to know about wearing face coverings and the new rule.What do they do and why are they a good idea?First of all, it’s important to note that wearing face masks does not offer you complete protection against Covid-19 and should not be treated as a substitute for all the other precautions people are supposed to be taking, such as regular hand-washing and social distancing.Their main function is to help stop you spreading the virus to another person if you are carrying it without your knowledge and moving around in the community.The virus is spread through cough or sneeze droplets so by covering your mouth and nose you reduce the odds of spreading the virus.Why is this being made mandatory all of a sudden?The Government has insisted masks will become more important as coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The two-metre social distancing rule for public transport operators will soon cease to apply and, instead, operators will be allowed to run at 50 per cent capacity.This means there will be more people using buses, trains and trams and so the risk of spreading the virus is greater.Fair enough. When does this new measure come into effect?The issue was discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting on Wednesday and it is expected the mandatory mask rule will take effect in the next week or two.Okay, where can I get one then?Masks can be picked up in any pharmacy, or you can also order them online.How much do they cost?You can buy disposable masks for less than a euro, or you can buy reusable masks, made of cloth, for less than €5.Alternatively, if you want to go upmarket with a designer face mask, various companies offer masks with different designs and creations. Prices vary but you can pick up a pack of three for about €20 in Boots.Seems reasonable enough. So how do you wear them?Firstly, avoid touching the mask itself and use the loops to fit it. Make sure it covers the nose and goes under the chin. It should also fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face and be secured with ties or ear loops. Avoid touching the mask while using it and, if you do, wash your hands.How do you take them on and off safely?You should clean your hands with soap and water beforehand. Then, take it off using the elastic tags without touching the front.Will I need a new mask every day?The disposable masks are designed for single use and should be disposed of afterwards in a bin. The reusable masks can be used about 50 times but should be washed after each use. The advice is to put reusable masks straight into the washing machine after use.Is there any advice on how to wash them?Yes. They need a hot wash over 60 degrees with detergent. If using a washing machine, you should be able to wash and machine dry it without damage or change to the shape. You do not need to sterilise it. You can also wash it by hand.Seems straightforward enough. When will I know to throw it out?You should throw out a cloth face covering when it no longer covers the nose and mouth has stretched out or damaged ties or straps cannot stay on the face or has holes or tears in the fabric.Are there any exceptions to wearing them?Cloth face coverings are not suitable for children under the age of 13 and anyone who has trouble breathing is unconscious or incapacitated is unable to remove it without help has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing it. Health authorities have instructed people not to stigmatise those who are observed without them.Where exactly will this be applicable?The rule will apply to all public transport, so that’s the rail network including the Dart and intercity services, as well as all public bus services, including Dublin Bus, and the Luas. We will have to wait and see whether the Government decides to apply the rule to private bus operators and taxis.How will this be policed?The truth is we don’t really know yet. Dermot O’Leary, the general secretary of the National Bus and Railworkers Union, has said this will be a difficult issue, but that it should not be a job a bus driver or frontline worker on the rail network should have to deal with.“The last thing we want is conflict between drivers and passengers or between passengers,” he said, adding there is a role for the gardaí, the transport companies and the National Transport Authority. However, the gardaí have said they do not comment on proposed regulations so we will have to wait until all this is formalised before we know more."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Move should help hospitality sector, says Foster, as no new Covid-19 deaths reportedNew government must not return to preCovid homelessness strategies, charity saysLeo Varadkar confirms move to phase three of easing Covid-19 restrictionsDeath toll in Republic 1,727, total number of known cases of infection 25,405Covid committee told of children \u0026lsquodestroying home, assaulting siblings\u0026rsquo from frustrationHealthcare package promised to women falls far short, survey of survivors showsIreland could be primed to win a share of the exploding market for small rocketsSupt Edmund Anthony O\u0026rsquoNeill alleged to have leaked confidential information to colleagueHypothesis is that \u0026lsquoNoah has in some way suffered an injury and is disorientated\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash PSNIBr\u0026iacuted Smyth TD commented on Mr Justice Garrett Simons\u0026rsquo minimum wage rulingJudge likens burial plot row to a story by John B.

Photograph: Elaine Hill Social distancing in Northern Ireland is to be reduced from two metres to one metre as further easing of the coronavirus regulations was announced on Thursday. First Minister Arlene Foster said a “minimum one-metre distance between iniduals can be considered acceptable in circumstances where appropriate mitigations are made”.She said this would have particular relevance to the hospitality industry, and that the Executive “will need to work closely with that sector to make sure we can work out the appropriate mitigations for that industry”. Industry body Hospitality Ulster welcomed the announcement, and said it was a “hugely significant development for our industry”. Its chief executive, Colin Neill, said it had “the potential to save lots of jobs and some hospitality businesses that thought they didn’t stand a chance at two metres”. The chair of the British Medical Association’s Northern Ireland Council, Dr Tom Black, said relaxing social distancing to one metre would expose people to greater risks of catching Covid-19, and should be accompanied by “a clear and strong recommendation” to wear face coverings in all indoor spaces outside of people’s own homes, and in all spaces where there was the potential for contact at less than two metres. No new coronavirus-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland on Thursday, according to the North’s department of health. The total number of fatalities recorded by the department since the beginning of the outbreak remains at 547. However the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus jumped by 850 due to changes in how data is recorded. Information on tests carried out in regional testing centres, mobile testing units and using home testing kits from April 29th was added to the department’s Covid-19 dashboard for the first time on Thursday, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases to 5,724. The seven-day rolling average of new cases was two. The department also published its current estimate of the R (reproduction) number of the virus, which it said had “remained steady” since last week at 0.6-0.9. At an Executive meeting on Thursday, ministers agreed provisional dates for the reopening of a number of other sectors. Tattoo parloursElite athletes will be able to use indoor training facilities from June 29th betting shops can reopen from July 3rd, and close contact services such as tattoo parlours, and reflexology and complementary therapies on July 6th. Indoor gyms and outdoor playgrounds will be permitted to open from July 10th, and libraries on July 16th. Competitive sport will begin again on July 17th with a limited number of outdoor spectators permitted until July 31st, when their numbers will be increased. Seated venues such as bingo halls and cinemas, as well as arcades, can reopen on July 29th, while leisure centres, skating rinks and soft play areas can open their doors again on August 7th. A broader indicative timetable for the further relaxation of restrictions is to be published shortly but the provisional dates – which will be subject to ratification closer to the time – are intended to allow people to plan ahead. “Let me be very clear,” said Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill. “Our ability to confirm these dates will be dependent on our control over the transmission levels of the virus nearer the time. “We need to be open about the fact that we may need to amend these dates in light of the emergent situation, and the Executive is also prepared to step back, if the need arises.” Ms O’Neill and Ms Foster also announced that funding for the free school meal scheme for disadvantaged children would be extended over the summer, and an announcement would be made to this effect on Tuesday. No decision was made on whether to make face coverings mandatory on public transport, but this is to be discussed again at a meeting of the Executive on Monday. On Thursday the Executive also gave the go-ahead to a number of measures which had previously been announced subject to the R rate of Covid-19 remaining below one. These include the reopening of places of worship from June 29th hotels, pubs and restaurants from July 3rd, and nail parlours and beauty salons on July 6th.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role.

Even though the number of flights and demand is low, they are regarded as special cases.It is understood that countries in a third wave, such as Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong, have been told it is unlikely that air bridges will be established before late summer.The USA, where Donald Trump has closed the borders, is unlikely to be opened until after November, although that will depend on whether states can reduce their coronavirus rates.New Zealand is planning to keep its borders closed with a 14-day quarantine until March because of fears of a second winter wave of coronavirus. That may change if a vaccine is developed and proves effective by then.The UK bridges policy is expected to be finalised at a Covid-19 strategy meeting on Thursday with Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and Priti Patel, the Home Secretary.Mr Shapps is understood to have been pressing for a more ambitious, bigger opening of travel corridors in the initial phase, describing them on Wednesday as a massive priority to reinvigorate the aviation industry, help rebuild the economy and enable Britons to enjoy overseas summer sun.Foreign holiday bookings have risen by 52 per cent in two weeks, according to travelsupermarket. Seven of the 10 top destinations are in Spain.The criteria for deciding which countries, to be published on Monday, is focused on the virus infection rate, whether it is rising or falling and whether the prospective destination has a test and trace system to limit any outbreaks and social distancing rules as strict as the UK\u0027s.It will be set against their popularity as destinations for Britons and the economic case, which could mean dozens of countries in the first two waves.Mr Shapps told MPs on Wednesday: You can see there are a lot  of complexities. I don\u0027t want to be evasive but I don\u0027t also want to give people false hope, which is why I need to wait until the end of the process and wait until June 29.The European Commission has warned that it would be discriminatory to allow travel corridors between some but not all EU countries with similar low-risk coronavirus profiles. Backbenchers are making similar pleas. Henry Smith, the chairman of the cross-party Future of Aviation group, said: I would like to see air corridors across the whole of the EU and Schengen area.The Department for Transport, however, argues that there is no legal impediment to bilateral deals. We would regard that as their problem. I don\u0027t think you can imagine Brussels trying to tell the Spanish: \u0027You can\u0027t take Britons, said a minister.The moves came as the airport ground handling company Swissport announced plans to cut more than 4,500 jobs. The Airport Operators\u0027 Association warned in a report on Wednesday of 20,000 job losses at airports and a further 100,000 in associated businesses.The International Air Transport Association (IATA), on Wednesday joined BA\u0027s parent company, Ryanair and Easyjet in a legal challenge to ditch quarantine because of the economic damage.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"day day coronavirus edges ever closer extinction time get back","story":"Across the United Kingdom, epidemiologists, public health officials and local bureaucrats are stamping their feet and gnashing their teeth. They’re furious about the fact that daily deaths from Covid-19 are continuing to decline at a precipitous rate. Contrary to their dire warnings, the easing of lockdown restrictions hasn’t led to an uptick in the rate of infection. The much ballyhooed ‘second spike’ has refused to materialise. The virus has all but disappeared.The extent to which Covid-19 has vanished isn’t immediately apparent from the figures. The death tolls announced each day refer to all those deaths involving coronavirus that have been ‘registered’ in the last 24 hours. That includes people who died weeks ago – sometimes months ago – but whose paperwork has only just been completed. If you look instead at the number of actual deaths in English hospitals in the last 24 hours, that gives a clearer picture. The number on June 23 was four – all in the north west. Fewer than 20 died in London hospitals in the past week. No one died on Tuesday.The number of deaths involving coronavirus is a better yardstick than the number of infections, partly because more and more people are being tested each day, and partly because the test itself isn’t very reliable. There is a gold-plated antibody test you can have done by a company called Pyser that employs ex-Army medics and operates out of the Honourable Artillery Company in the City of London. I took one last week and tested positive.But the PCR test – which tells you whether you’ve got it, not whether you’ve had it – throws up a lot of false positives. To give you an idea of how unreliable it is, take this announcement by Norway’s Institute of Public health last month. “Given today’s contagion situation in Norway, health professionals must test around 12,000 random people to find one positive case of Covid-19,” it said. “In such a selection, there will be about 15 positive test responses, but 14 of these will be false positives.”Government scientists try and factor this in when calculating the R number and, according to them, it’s below one. That means that if 10 people have the virus, they’ll pass it on to fewer than 10 people. That’s quite remarkable when you consider that more than 300,000 people have been thronging the streets, protesting about racism, over the past few weeks. The average incubation period of the disease is about six days, so if the BLM demos were going to cause an uptick in the rate of infection we’d be seeing some evidence of that by now. But we’re not.It’s becoming clear that the social distancing rules – even the new one-metre rule – are unnecessary. Some alarmists will point to a rise in infections elsewhere as “evidence” that we’re easing restrictions too soon. Last month, they leapt gleefully on Germany after the number of daily infections ticked up. But it turned out that was entirely due to an isolated incident in a meat-packing warehouse. To date, Germany has suffered around 9,000 Covid deaths, about a third of the total number that succumbed to seasonal flu in 2017-18, and daily deaths have dwindled away to almost nothing.This month, these same Cassandras are pointing to the rising number of infections in American states like Florida, Arizona and Texas, which were among the first to reopen. But that’s largely due to increased testing, particularly in care homes. In Florida, for instance, in the first two weeks of June the number of people being tested increased by 37 per cent, but the number of cases only increased by 28 per cent. And if you compare the 43 US states that did lock down with the seven that didn’t (Utah, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Arkansas, Wyoming and Iowa), the latter have suffered 11 per cent fewer Covid deaths per million than the former.At the beginning of the crisis, we believed SARS-CoV-2 was a particularly deadly disease because some sufferers were asymptomatic – perhaps as many as 50 per cent. Indeed, part of the rationale for the lockdown was that it was no good just asking those with symptoms to self- isolate because the “silent spreaders” would still be at large, infecting those around them. But we now know that asymptomatic people are very rarely infectious, something confirmed at a WHO press conference on 6 June.Another thing we’ve learnt about Covid-19 is that many people have a natural immunity to it, probably because they’ve already developed antibodies to similar viruses, such as the common cold. This is one reason why the estimated infection fatality rate has been falling steadily since January. Originally, the WHO put it at 3.4 per cent, but that was revised downwards by Imperial College in March to 0.9 per cent, then downwards again to 0.67 per cent, and now the CDC puts it at 0.26 per cent. It will probably settle at around 0.1 per cent, about the same as seasonal flu.It\u0027s clear that the government’s scientific advisors significantly overestimated the risk posed by the virus at the beginning of the crisis and that placing the entire country under lockdown was unnecessary. Why did they? In part because overstating the virulence and deadliness of a new disease poses less risk to their professional reputations than understating it, a point made by the Nobel laureate Michael Levitt.Professor Neil Ferguson\u0027s modelling evidence has consistently exaggerated the danger of various pathogens by an order of magnitude, from foot and mouth disease to swine flu, but his reputation hasn’t suffered one jot. Had he done the opposite, he probably wouldn’t have been as influential as he has been during this pandemic. But I’m going to go out on a limb and predict there will be no “second spike” – not now, and not in the autumn either. The virus has melted into thin air.

Ian Blackford has taken it upon himself to demand action from the Prime Minister when the policy in Scotland is decided by Nicola Sturgeon and the administration at Holyrood. What happens in England is not a matter for the Westminster leader of the SNP. Indeed, he is not accountable for what happens north of the Border, either.The constituent parts of the UK have gone their own way, albeit more in timing than in substance. Ms Sturgeon has insisted upon maintaining a two metre rule in Scotland and has not yet followed England in modifying it to “one metre plus if circumstances allow” but will soon. In Wales, there is still a restriction on driving more than five miles from home which will need to end soon if the Principality is to benefit from “staycation” tourism this summer. It is expected to be lifted on July 6.Given the fact that the leaders of the four nations have access to the same scientific advice, these differences are perplexing though may be deliberate in order to make a point, which is not something their voters will appreciate. Indeed, in Scotland a public backlash has led the government to promise the return of all schools in August, when the term normally starts, without any social distancing among pupils.In England Mr Johnson has said all schools will return in September but this will only be possible with no social distancing. As we report today the Government is drawing up plans to match Scotland with “bubbles” of 30 children per class.

A similar study in Geneva found antibodies in just 10 per cent of the population, while in the Italian ski resort of Val Gardena, it was 27 per cent.“We believe supers-preading events, such as those that took place in après-ski bars, made a significant contribution to the widespread spread,” said Prof Dorothee von Laer, the leader of the Ischgl study.The scientists behind the new study claim it is the highest infection rate found anywhere in the world. A study in Bergamo released earlier this month found antibodies in 57 per cent of people in the Italian city, but the authors of the Ischgl study claim their research is based on more rigorous testing and a higher sample size.The tiny village of just 1,800 people in the Tyrolean Alps, is believed to have been a major source of the European outbreak as people returned home from skiing holidays.Hundreds of infections in Germany, Iceland, Norway and Denmark have been traced back to the resort, and it has been linked to suspected cases in the UK.Packed apres-ski bars where people played drinking games in which they passed the same ping-pong ball from glass to glass are believed to have been the perfect environment for the virus to spread.Yet despite the high infection rate, only nine Ischgl residents had to be hospitalised for the virus, and only two died — meaning the fatality rate in the village was just 0.24 per cent.Research for the new study took place in April, after the resort had been closed to tourists and placed under quarantine.The rate of infection in the village was more than six times higher than previously thought — 85 per cent of those found with antibodies had not previously been diagnosed and were unaware they had been infected,“We assumed a high rate of undocumented cases before the start of the study and, as in other hotspots, it has now been confirmed,” said Prof von Laer.Many of those who were not previously diagnosed reported losing their sense of taste and smell, a common symptom of the virus.Although the infection rate was high , it did not reach the 60 to 70 per cent required for herd immunity.“Even if this does not imply herd immunity, the population of Ischgl should still be largely protected,” said Prof von Laer.“What is particularly interesting about the results of the study in Ischgl is that the majority of people with antibodies were identified as corona cases only by the study. This underlines the importance of antibody studies,” said Dr Peter Willeit, another of the study’s authors.The study found the infection rate was much lower among children, at 27 per cent. Almost none of the children showed any symptoms.In all, 1,473 Ischgl residents took part in the study, accounting for 79 per cent of the village’s population.The scientists followed a rigorous procedure. Blood samples underwent at least two antibody tests, and in some cases were tested four times to eliminate false positives.The authorities in Ischgl are facing legal action from skiers who say they acted too slowly in shutting the resort down.The Austrian government ignored warnings from Iceland that it was seeing a large number of infections in people returning from the resort, and it has emerged that local authorities failed to close down crowded apres-ski bars after they knew of virus cases in the resort.“People were hot and sweaty from skiing, and waiters were delivering shots to tables in their hundreds. You couldn\u0027t have a better home for a virus,” Daren Bland, a British IT consultant who fell ill after returning from Ischgl told the  in MarchVideo obtained by the  shows people packed shoulder to shoulder and singing Highway to Hell in the popular Kitzloch bar.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"japan scraps 34bn us missile defence system residents site complain","story":"Japan on Thursday scrapped plans to build a £3.4 billion US missile-defence system, ending a saga of poor planning and opposition from locals at the proposed site.  Taro Kano, the Defence Minister, announced the decision to cancel the construction of two Aegis Ashore missile interceptor bases after a meeting of the National Security Council on Wednesday. Two years ago the Japanese government said it would purchase the system, which can intercept ballistic missiles at a range of up to 1,500 miles, in order to counter the rising threat from North Korea.   The potential sites for the bases were identified as Akita Prefecture, facing the Korean Peninsula in the far north of Japan, and Yamaguchi Prefecture, on the far southern tip of the main island of Honshu and providing an arc of defence over islands that are claimed by China as its sovereign territory.Under the initial plan, the bases were due to be operational as early as 2025.There was immediate resistance from local residents, many of whom feared that the missile sites would make their communities targets in the event of hostilities with neighbouring nations.There was also concern over the impact on human health from the electromagnetic radiation that is produced by the radar units, as well as their effect on nearby television, radio and telephone signals.The controversy deepened when the ministry admitted that it had relied on erroneous data from the Google Earth app to narrow down the potential locations for the bases.The ministry failed to verify the actual height of mountains close to the proposed sites for the Akita base, which would have affected the effectiveness of the missiles.  The ministry’s failures were again highlighted a few months later when it was pointed out that the coastal site selected for the Akita base, on the military’s Araya training ground, is prone to flooding and simulations show that it would be inundated to a depth of several feet in the event of a tsunami.  Local residents once again expressed their anger when the ministry confirmed that components that are released from the missiles when they are launched could fall on residential districts close to the base. “We repeatedly took up this issue in protests against the deployment”, Hiroyuki Masuyama, a professor at Yamaguchi University who heads a local group opposed to the deployment, told the Yamaguchi Shimbun newspaper. “People living near the site had expressed concern that rocket boosters from the interceptors could drop into residential areas”, he added.The Japanese government has confirmed that it is examining alternative defensive measures, including the construction of Aegis Ashore on floating barges that could be moored offshore. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 25th june 2020","story":"Russian sailors march toward Red Square during the Victory Day military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the Nazi defeat in Moscow, RussiaScots to be allowed to visit loved ones in care homes for first time in more than three monthsCoronavirus latest news: \u0026#39Major incident\u0026#39 declared after thousands flock to Bournemouth beaches in heatwaveTony Blair says UK must ultimately side with US on Huawei 5G decisionJacob Rees-Mogg suggests pub-goers \u0026#39go back to drinking a yard of ale\u0026#39 to aid social distancingUK public is not staying at home as figures show most are as mobile as before lockdownWhat is Johnsonism?

Luis Araujo, chief executive of Visit Portugal, this week told the  that he was optimistic the UK would be “fully confident” for Britons to return. “We are very excited to be welcoming them back,” he said. Portugal welcomed 2.5million visitors from the UK last year.  Turkey, Croatia and the US are three other popular destinations not to be included in the first tranche of deals.France, Spain and Italy, however, will be included in the first deals, allowing the return of travellers for the first time since March. A spokesperson from the Italian tourist board said: We will be delighted if this is officially confirmed by the UK Government. We look forward to welcoming British tourist to our country, a long-time favourite of UK holidaymakers, and they can be sure of a warm reception”.Follow the latest news belowA busy day for UK holidaymakers as they await news on European air bridges.Here are the key developments of the day. Read about them all below. Portugal set to miss out on first air bridge dealsFrance says confirmation could come on Thursday eveningUK accommodation selling out for the summerCentre Parcs announces reopening, but pools will remain closedIreland will not rush forward international travelThank you for reading join us tomorrow for the latest news. UK accommodation is selling out for the summer, some firms have warned, as Britons prepare to stay in the UK rather than risk Europe. “People need to book very quickly if they want a holiday in the UK this summer,” Mike Bevens, Managing Director of Canopy \u0026amp Stars, told  Travel. “We’re seeing exceptionally high demand at the moment since Boris Johnson’s announcement on Tuesday, bookings have trebled for July and August holidays and website demand has increased by 176 per cent.”The same can be said for the holiday cottage market. “Over the past two days, the summer holidays have been incredibly popular. They are now selling at just over seven times the rate they were last year,” James Starkey, Chief Marketing Officer at holidaycottages, told  Travel. “Any additional availability we had whilst people weren’t booking over the past few months is therefore being filled up very quickly.”Read the full story.The head of France\u0027s tourism agency has said it expects official confirmation of a UK air bridge tonight.Caroline Leboucher, CEO at Atout France, was responding to news reported in the  that France was likely to be in the first tranche of bilateral travel deals to be announced this weekend. But Leboucher said: We expect an official statement on this matter to be released tonight. Until then, we are unable to confirm this information. Atout France is following Foreign Office updates closely, and so far, restrictions and advice for UK travellers has not been updated.One thing for sure – France is right next door and we are ready and looking forward to welcoming our British friends back again this summer. We have been working with all our partners in the tourism industry, to ensure France is fully accessible once again.The Swiss ski resort of Les Diablerets has celebrated being able to reopen in a rather hair-raising way this week.World Record holding tightrope walker Freddy Nock put on a high-altitude performance, walking 40 metres along the steepest section of the cable that holds the resort’s Col du Pillon gondola. Without a harness, just a bar to balance himselve, the Swiss native broke his own record for walking the steepest incline on a tightrope, at 39.1 degrees. The gondola usually transports skiers and snowboarders to the resort’s Glacier 3000, but as Les Diablerets celebrates reopening in the post-pandemic world Nock traded the safety of being inside the cabin for the roof.Nock broke his own high-altitude recordReunion Island, the French department in the Indian Ocean, has said it will welcome overseas guests without the need to quarantine from July 10. The island was mooted as a possible early air bridge with the UK, with Public Health England said to be happy with its infection rates. Masks will be compulsory in communal areas of tourist accommodation and restaurants will be adapted to handle social distancing requirements. The Reunion tourist board said: All natural areas such as beaches, cirques and volcanoes are already open to the public.Portugal\u0027s omission from the list of air bridge deals is a glaring one, writes Chris Leadbeater.It is a glaring omission as well. More than two million British travellers make a dash for Portugal every year - a figure that soared during the Noughties most noticeably in 2015, when the country recorded a seven per cent surge in Britons spending nights in its hotels. This love affair has continued in the subsequent half-decade - 2019 was a record year for British arrivals at Portuguese airports, with 2.1 million of us pouring through its terminals.This also marked a reversal of a small trend. Early in 2019, the Algarve reported that its number of UK visitors had declined by about 250,000 over the course of 2017 and 2018. But it attributed this fall to to the slump in the value of the pound in the wake of the 2016 EU referendum - rather than a loss of interest in the product. This would be fair. The British affection for a holiday in Portugal remains undimmed - and not just in obvious tourism zones like the Algarve, Lisbon and Madeira, but in lesser-known areas like the Alentejo, Norte (where Porto and its wineries are popular) and the islands of the Azores.Read the full story. Some reaction to the possible air bridge list has come in from the Greek tourist office in the UK. Greece has been vocal about the possible options for welcoming back British holidaymakers. Emy Anagnostopoulou, director of the Greek National Tourism Organisation, said:The UK market is one of the most important markets for Greek tourism and has been for decades. We are really excited with the strong possibility that Greece will be among the first air bridges from the UK and we are hoping that the two governments will lift restrictions giving the opportunity to our British friends to choose the Greek destinations for their holidays.And some from Germany. A spokesperson for the German tourist board said: Germany is open for visitors and we are delighted to hear that Germany could be among the first air bridge countries. Germany has a great variety of tourism experiences on offer so there is something for everyone to enjoy. The tourism sector in Germany is committed to operating in a safe and responsible manner and we are looking forward to welcoming our British and Irish guests again.Does this mean I can book my holiday now? Will the price of holidays go up if I don’t book now? Will I still have to quarantine, even if an air bridge is announced while I’m away?The air bridge arrangement is raising as many questions as it is answering. Greg Dickinson tries to get to the bottom of things. Visitors to Amsterdam may soon be required to pay €50 (£45) for a passport to stay overnight. And they may be able to visit a purpose-built theme park housing the red-light district, marijuana ‘coffeeshops’, and all-night bars.These are just two of the ideas being proposed in response to mayor Femke Halsema’s call for plans for a new way forward for tourism in Amsterdam.Mayor Halsema’s new vision aims to preserve quality of life for Amsterdammers, and put a halt to ravages of the city’s quiet charm, favouring visitors who come to Amsterdam for its art, history and cultural abundance over the good-time, beer-and-spliff brigade.Read the full report.While no-one is suggesting that the Covid-19 crisis is over, the conversation in Europe has at least moved on to how life may be once the virus has receded. Travel has reemerged as a genuine possibility rather than a vague theory, with Spain reopening its borders last weekend, and Malta announcing that it will do the same thing from July 1.So spare a thought for South America, where travellers on the road back to some sort of normality have further to go. This week, Colombia has announced that it is taking the chains off its borders. However, the key will not turn fully in the lock until September 1. Read the full story.A mural in BogotaThere is no chance of travel restrictions in Ireland lifting ahead of schedule, with the middle of July the most likely date.This is according to a report in the , which quotes a government source as saying that despite the talk of ‘air bridges’ Ireland plans to remain in lockdown in terms of international movement. “The mood music has definitely changed and air bridges are being looked at in a very meaningful way but there is still no chance restrictions will be lifted on July 1,” the source said. “We realise we are behind the European Union but it still won’t happen quickly.”The country is set to move into a new phase of lockdown on Monday, with bars and restaurants able to reopen and travel restrictions within Ireland lifted. When it comes to air bridges, Spain, Italy, Greece and France have got the all-clear. But what about Portugal? Oliver Smith writes:Perhaps the most surprising omission is Portugal. The country is Britain’s oldest ally (634 years and counting) and is heavily reliant on free spending UK sunseekers. Around 2.5m of us visit each year, with the Algarve being the big draw, and back in February the country even suggested it would subsidise UK holidaymakers after Brexit to make sure they keep coming. Furthermore, it has been widely praised for its handling of coronavirus. Just over 150 deaths per million residents have been recorded in Portugal, putting it well ahead of Spain (606), Italy (573) and, indeed, the UK (647). Should its exclusion be confirmed, it would appear to have been punished for a recent spike in cases. The capital, Lisbon, and its surrounding metropolitan area, woke up on Tuesday to increased restrictions and more power for police to enforce them following a series of illegal parties, some attended by as many as 1,000 revellers. Its links with Brazil, where deaths are still spiralling, could also be a factor. Telegraph Travel has run through eight unanswered questions lingering ahead of the UK Government\u0027s likely announcement on air bridges this weekend.Does this mean I can book my holiday now? Well, not exactly. The Foreign Office still warns against all but essential travel (something which is “under constant review”), and the above lists have been revealed to the  via a Government source, not yet formally announced. The announcement is expected on or before June 29, and holidays to those destinations are expected to resume on July 4.However, given the numerous about-turns performed by the Government during the Covid-19 crisis, it would not be beyond the realms of possibility to learn that one of the countries in the aforementioned ‘Phase One’ list of air bridges is omitted. Italy’s Foreign Minister, Luigi di Maio, has previously said bilateral agreements on tourist flows are against the EU’s spirit”, for example. The pandemic is ever-changing and it would not be unimaginable to learn Italy, or indeed any of the countries mentioned, had stepped away from UK air bridge negotiations. Sudden spikes of Covid-19 cases are also of course an enduring possibility.It is also possible that the date when holidays officially resume is not July 4 but rather a date slightly further in the future – the following week, perhaps.Read the full story.  Visitors to Toshimaen amusement park in Tokyo are enjoying hydrangeas in bloom as rainy season arrives in Japan.

Conversely, the comparison website said, searches for the US are down 22 per cent. Tenerife, Corfu and Rhodes have also seen rises in interest. Emma Coulthurst from TravelSupermarket said that there had also been large growth in searches for UK holidays after the Government announced the reopening of the tourism industry from July 4. Searches for UK cottages are up 141 per cent this week compared to last. Car hire bookings are up 41 per cent.With all the talk of the air bridge deals that might be in place next week, it is worth noting that planes are already returning to European skies.

Pools and spas will not be open until at least July 28, the company said.Only cashless payments will be accepted across the villages and all activities must be booked online. A new takeaway service will be in place for lodges. Center Parcs’ CEO, Martin Dalby, said: “We’ve had our teams working around the clock to review everything we do, right down to the smallest detail, and we‘re now ready to open our doors again.“Those families who have visited us before will notice some changes to the way we’re doing things, but the essence of a Center Parcs break will remain the same, offering a fantastic short break experience with plenty of space within our 400 acres of natural woodland.”Greece wants British holidaymakers to return on July 1, the country’s tourism minister has said. Haris Theoharis said that a decision between the UK and Greece will “be in place in the next few days” and that there should be no need for visitors returning to Britain from Greece to quarantine. Greece is one of the countries included in the initial tranche of air bridge deals reported by the  today. Theoharis told Radio 4: “The point is that Greece is a safe country - we have proven that during this crisis and we will continue proving this in the exit stages of the health situation. We feel that the risk of someone contracting the disease in Greece is much lower than most of the countries in Europe and indeed the rest of the world.Bookings for UK holidays have soared since Boris Johnson announced an easing of the lockdown from July 4. Here is everything you need to know about your \u0027staycation\u0027 this summer - and what is left to find out.St Ives is set to be popular this summerAustralian airline Qantas is to cut at least 6,000 jobs and keep 15,000 more workers on furlough as it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. The carrier said it also plans to ground 100 planes for more than a year and will retire its last six Boeing 747 aircraft. Qantas is a popular choice for Britons travelling to Australia, especially since the launch of the first non-stop, direct route between London and Perth in 2018.Chief Executive Alan Joyce said the airline has to become smaller as it braces for several years of much lower revenues. He said the furloughed workers faced a long interruption to their airline careers.The actions that we\u0027re taking will have a huge impact on thousands of our people. This is something that weighs very heavily on all of us, Joyce told reporters. This is something that we don\u0027t make a decision on very easily. But the collapse of billions of dollars in revenue leaves us with little choice if we are to save as many jobs as possible longer term.Joyce said the airline entered the crisis in a better position than most airlines and remained optimistic about the future.Guests staying at Premier Inn this summer will be kept apart by floor markings in the communal areas of the hotel, while staff will be behind acrylic screens at check-in and wear additional PPE “where appropriate”. New no-touch key return boxes and automated hand sanitisers are among changes to be introduced by the hotel chain as it prepares to reopen on July 4. Premier Inns are, of course, not the only hotels due to open next weekend.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dizzee Rascal has been praised for refusing to answer Piers Morgan’s question about Black Lives Matter during an appearance on Good Morning Britain.The rapper was invited to talk to Morgan and Susanna Reid about the introduction of drive-in raves, which are said to be temporarily replacing crowd-filled live concerts following the Covid-19 pandemic.Morgan though, soon steered the conversation away from this subject and asked for Dizzee’s views on “what Black Lives matter actually means”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee refused to comment on the situation, asking Morgan: “What makes you think I know? Am I the black spokesperson?”He then told Morgan that, while he has “a bunch of views” to share, he felt that “now is not the time” to speak about them.Meet Che Lingo, the London rapper confronting police brutalityHow the art world can step up for Black Lives Matter“I’ve brought my afro out, I’m looking a bit natural and so maybe that’s why you’re asking the question, but not today,” he said. Morgan defended himself by saying: “That’s not why I’m asking you the question. You’re a high-profile black man in this country, and it’s been a huge issue and has been a huge news story for four weeks.”Dizzee, attempting to get a word in, replied: “You know what, I watch you on telly and you never let no one speak. You’re not going to do this to me, mate. Let’s keep it calm.”After Morgan called his response “aggressive”, Dizzee – laughing – replied: “This is what happens – I become the aggressive black man! I just wanted to be nice, and look how he’s behaving.”Viewers praised the rapper for “totally owning” Morgan.“Dizzee Rascal has made everyone’s morning,” one tweeter wrote, adding: ”I love watching Piers Morgan squirm for once. Totally owned haha.”Another added: “I’m so happy the way Dizzee Rascal called out Piers Morgan for asking him about BLM on GMB – why does every white host ask every black person about BLM, but not white people?!”“Dizzee Rascal what a bloke,” one person concluded. “Sticking Piers Morgan in his place whilst fishing to stir up more issues when he’s got positive things to talk about.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Over the years, it has been criticised for presenting the Antebellum South and its history of slavery through rose-tinted glasses.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAfter being taken down by HBO Max, Gone with the Wind has now returned to the site, along with two videos discussing its historical context.One clip features TV host and film scholar Jacqueline Stewart, who says that while the movie was “one of most enduringly popular films of all time”, its depiction of African American people was controversial even when it was released 80 years ago.Why has Gone with the Wind been accused of racism?“Producer David O Selznick was well aware that black audiences were deeply concerned about the film’s handling of the topic of slavery and its treatment of black characters,” she said.She added that the film’s treatment of the Antebellum South as a “world of grace and beauty… through a lens of nostalgia denies the horrors of slavery, as well as its legacies of racial inequality”.The second video features a panel debating Gone with the Wind’s “complicated legacy”.Hattie McDaniel, who played house servant Mammy in the film, became the first African American to win an Oscar when she was awarded the accolade for Best Supporting Actress.However, due to racial segregation, she was not allowed to sit with the other cast members at the ceremony dinner.Gone with the Wind\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Acts including Static-X, Dope, Bobaflex and Royal Bliss are set to feature.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Twitter, the band wrote: “Nonpoint is not playing the show because of the name of the show.”Since then, the festival’s organisers have removed the original advertising on Facebook, and posted a message which reads: “For the record the venues land can accommodate up to 10,000 occupancy.

Takes us all away on a trip that unless you have felt it you won’t understand.”The “herd immunity” theory posits that allowing the coronavirus to spread through the population encourages people to quickly develop immunity, becoming less likely to then pass the virus on to others.It has been refuted by many medical experts and has been rejected as a pandemic strategy in countries across Europe.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That star is around 11 light years away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSuper-Earths like the newly found planets have a higher mass than the Earth but are much smaller than the ice giants of our solar system, Uranus and Neptune. They are a key target in the hunt for life on other worlds. What\u0027s more, the newly found planets are close to the habitable zone, where it is not too hot or cold for water to exist in liquid form, and could be rocky planets.Scientists want to catch interstellar objects with ring of satellitesThe star was discovered using the HARPS spectograph, based at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, by RedDots astronomers who are looking for planets around red dwarfs.They were able to infer the planets around the star by using a technique called Doppler wobble, which lets them watch for the tiny movements of the star that are caused by the gravitational pull of the planets around them.They found that the star appeared to be orbited by planets that have orbits that would give them years of just 9.3 and 21.8 days on Earth. That suggests the planets are moving very quickly around their star, faster even than Mercury.Gliese 887 is also dimmer and smaller than our Sun, meaning that the planets could get much closer to the star while still being potentially habitable.The astronomers also found that the red dwarf is less active than our Sun. If it was as active as our star, Gliese 887 would probably blow away the atmospheres of the planets that surround it – but its relative calm means that the world\u0027s could still have their atmospheres, an indication that they could be supportive to any life there.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

That means that it should be easier to detect the atmospheres of the system using technology such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which has the ability to sniff the makeup of an atmosphere from a distance.That has been touted as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, but has been subject to a number of delays. Astronomers hope that they can use it and other equipment to investigate the newly discovered worlds, peering at them from a relatively close distance.These planets will provide the best possibilities for more detailed studies, including the search for life outside our Solar System, said Sandra Jeffers, from the University of Göttingen and lead author of the study.The new research is published in a paper, titled \u0027A multiple planet system of super-Earths orbiting the brightest red dwarf star GJ887\u0027, in the journal Science today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo? You’ll find plenty of of delicious ideas from the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Amanda Grant at vegpower.org.uk. You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline. Former Love Island contestant Joshua Ritchie, who was allegedly among those who turned up at the beach, was seen carrying a large speaker with friends in a video.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman declined to comment on particular scenes on beaches, but told reporters: “The prime minister and the government’s scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.“It is only due to the public’s hard work that we have been able to bring the virus under control, and if the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will have to look at having to reverse some of the easements that have been put in place and I don’t think anyone in the British public would want that to happen.”There were hundreds of kids grouped up on the Roath Park Rec earlier this evening. They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Timms told The Independent: “It is puzzling that the department is leaving the announcement so late, with the current arrangements coming to an end in less than a week.I hope they will announce without further delay that the current conditionality easements will be extended for another three months.”Alison Garnham, our chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said next week was way too soon to end the suspension of conditionality and sanctions for people claiming universal credit.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The figure rose to more than three-fifths among those on zero-hours contracts.Iain Porter, social security policy and partnerships manager at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “As we enter a deep recession, there are already worrying signs that the number of people in work is falling. Job vacancies are in short supply and when the furlough scheme begins to unwind, many more people will find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own.“Universal credit rules must continue to reflect the reality of our dysfunctional jobs market. The government should commit to extending the suspension of job-seeking requirements so that people already struggling from the economic fallout of coronavirus are not pulled further into poverty.” Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said a suspension on job-seeking requirements for people facing particular barriers would be the “right thing to do”, to avoid causing people stress and worry about potential sanctions.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A horse is washed down at Haydock RacecoursePeople enjoy the hot weather on Margate beachTony Bennett the owner of The Devereux pub in Temple, London.

Nine in ten businesses are waiting to be paid an average of £148,917. Some 81 per cent of firms are also expecting to be made to wait longer to be paid for work done from now on, with half expecting to wait anywhere between 14 to 30 days longer than normal, the survey found.Coronavirus loans backed by government and furlough bill exceed £60bnThe businesses joining forces to get a better deal from their landlordGyms furious as rest of England opens upBusinesses breathe sigh of relief as social distancing rule relaxedQueen sends message of support to UK businesses as some reopenFifteen per cent of companies fear they could be waiting anywhere between three to six months longer to be paid for work.More than half of the firms surveyed that applied for the government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) were declined. The 43 per cent who were successful applied for almost double the amount of a typical loan of £211,667 they would have taken.Anil Stocker, chief executive of Marketfinance, said: “The reopening of the UK’s high streets marked the first buoyant moment for UK businesses in months but it might well be the calm before the storm.“Businesses are facing a three-prong assault on their finances. First up, it’s alarming that only half of their CBILS loans are being granted, then we learn that they close to £150,000 in outstanding payments since the lockdown began, and now it’s likely that they will have to wait twice as long to get paid for new work they do whilst demand and economic activity normalises.“Coupled with a very moderate outlook for trading conditions, ‘rent quarter day’ this week and uncertainty about their workforce no doubt this will put further pressure on businesses.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our job retention scheme has protected more than nine million jobs across the UK. We have extended it until October – meaning it will have been open for eight months and will continue to support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work.As well as furloughing staff, we have introduced a wide range of other targeted support measures to support people and protect jobs, including billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals, mortgage holidays and more than £6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net.The Marketfinance report comes amid a slew of warnings from business groups, who are urging the government to extend grant support schemes set up to support businesses during the lockdown.The Confederation of British Industry said on Wednesday that the survival of many firms in the hardest-hit sectors “hangs in the balance”, while the Trades Union Congress has urged chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce spending plans to avoid widespread unemployment.Confederation of British Industry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are among the stars who have today urged Londoners to bid on sections of Sir Peter Blake’s pop artwork Our Fans to raise money for Help the Hungry.Last Friday, The Independent announced that the giant mural — draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge during its 2017 renovation — would be cut into 100 sections and auctioned off.The work, which echoes Sir Peter’s famous 1967 artwork for The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, is his largest piece, the size of 38 London buses. Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

St John’s Gardens is home to several war memorials. That’s not the right place for people to be screaming above head on a zip wire.”The economic argument – that the attraction would bring tens of thousands of tourists to the city every year – did not stack up, he added.“I think it would end up closing after a few years,” he said. “I’m not convinced that level of demand would be sustained.”Some 29 objections have already been registered against the scheme. One argued that that zipwire would “represent the Disneyisation of one of the city’s most cultural areas, making it appear tacky”.Zip World, the company behind the proposal, said the plans would bring something new to the area and that it would “tremendously sensitive” to the surrounding history.”Andrew Hudson, commercial director, said: “We feel it will add to the culture that’s already in the city, whether it’s the music tourism or the football tourism, we think it will add tremendous value.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We could probably have about 10 to 15 people sitting outside,” Alex Coomes, founder of Brightwater Brewery – whose brewery tap is the Claygate micropub – says. “For us, that is not profitable,” he tells The Independent. “So we have decided not to open for sales.”Pubs were ordered shut in late March due to the coronavirus outbreak, with the government saying earlier this week English establishments can open their doors again in early July as long as they follow certain precautions.Up until now, pubs have been finding other ways to survive, such as by doing takeout service – like The Globe – or door-to-door service. Coomes from Platform 3 says he has been driving around his local area dropping beer at houses – sometimes getting an emotional welcome. “When this all kicked off, I was delivering beers to people and they would burst into tears because they hadn’t seen anybody all week,” he tells The Independent.

Meanwhile in Suffolk, The Nutshell, another tiny pub, is hoping to be get permission to sell drinks to people standing outside. Until then, one of the landlords tells The Independent it is ”not really feasible” for his establishment – with an inside space of 15ft by 7ft – to reopen, even with the relaxed rules in early July. “We wouldn’t be able to serve a pint on the bar very easily,” Geoff Page from the Bury St Edmunds pub explains.“The member of staff would have to step back from the bar for the customer to get up from the seat on the edge of the pub to collect the pint.”He estimates the pub would be able to fit five single people inside – all sitting on their on their own – under the social distancing rules, which say people must stay at least one metre apart as a preventative measure against Covid-19. “Our unique selling point – the size of us – happens to be the Achilles heel in this particular situation,” Page says. Martin says they have been told they can serve people outside between 10am to 5pm. “Which is great,” she tells The Independent,” but that’s not when I have any business. I have business in the evening.” Outdoor space has been key for The Rake, a small pub in central London, to plan its reopening on 4 July. The establishment in Borough Market has been open as an off-licence throughout lockdown, with people queueing up in their gardens for takeaway beer – with draught beer poured into an open can, then sealed using a machine on the bar, as an option. When will pubs, cinemas, restaurants and hairdressers be open from?Pubs to offer al fresco dining and takeaway pints under new billOne of Britain’s smallest pubs on reopening during coronavirus“Our small garden is going to be used for customers,” manager George Aldridge tells The Independent. ”We are going to be introducing table service and table bookings – which we have never done before.” Mike Hill, the founder of Utobeer which runs the London pub, tells The Independent: “I think if we didn’t have outside space, and somebody told us we couldn’t use outside space, I would probably seriously consider not opening.”The small size of the pub means customers will not be allowed to drink inside, he adds. While some pubs will be planning to welcome back people in a socially-distanced environment on 4 July, others – including smaller ones – have decided to wait a bit longer. Coomes from Platform 3 in Claygate says his tiny pub – which can fit just one person inside – cannot afford the extra costs that would come with reopening during the pandemic, such as having a person manning the toilets. “I can’t justify having someone do that in my micropub,” he says. ”The figures don’t add up for us.”Speaking about pubs being able to reopen on new conditions, the landlord of The Nutshell – which is thought to be one of the smallest pubs in the UK – tells The Independent: “It is not going to change really very much at all for ourselves at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

of avoiding a disastrous no-deal Brexit at the end of the year has been rejected by the UK’s chief negotiator.With the talks deadlocked, it was thought the EU could agree to give the UK the ability to break free from its rules – in return for the right to impose tariffs if it chose to do so.The arrangement would have avoided the feared cliff-edge on 31 December, when the UK will crash out of the single market and customs union unless an agreement is struck.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, in a series of tweets, David Frost, Boris Johnson’s negotiator, announced: “I want to be clear that the government will not agree to ideas like the one currently circulating giving the EU a new right to retaliate with tariffs if we chose to make laws suiting our interests.“We could not leave ourselves open to such unforeseeable economic risk.”Minister won’t comment on chlorinated chicken, claiming US listeningBritish officials had suggested Boris Johnson would consider the compromise, under which the UK would secure the right to deviate from Brussels’ standards in areas such as state aid.The EU was thought to be sceptical – preferring to strike a firm deal, rather than set a path for future conflict in the relationship – but had welcomed what it viewed as new-found flexibility in London.After clashes following recent remote negotiations, optimism had crept up that an agreement could be reached when face-to-face talks resume next week.But, without the proposed fudge – kicking key decisions into the future – the two sides remain at odds over access to UK fishing waters and ‘level playing field rules’ to protect the EU from unfair competition.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Voting has begun across Russia on proposed constitutional reforms that would allow Vladimir Putin to rule until at least 2036.The vote is being brought to Russians via impromptu polling booths on park benches, on buses, in the boots of cars, in theatres and factories, and even in “hot zones” of Covid-19 hospitals. Voting will continue for an unprecedented seven days, and every day will see a lottery draw, raffling anything from supermarket vouchers to cars and apartments. Authorities insist that such creativity is a necessary response to the challenges posed in the era of the coronavirus. Opponents say the extraordinary measures to increase turnout demonstrate the unpopularity of Mr Putin’s decision to prioritise a power grab during a pandemic. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe vote, which was originally planned for 22 April before being rescheduled to this week, will ask Russians for a yes or no answer on over 200 new amendments to the country’s constitution.The most important of these proposed changes – the resetting of presidential term limits – has been routinely under-emphasised in voting literature, and in one case was even omitted. Official messages have concentrated instead on populist measures such as cementing marriage as a union of man and woman, emphasising the role of God, and guaranteeing indexation of pensions and other social payments. The vote is not a referendum per se the amendments have, in fact, already been passed by both parliaments. Pro-democracy groups say that the unclear classification of the vote is no accident. In a referendum, both sides are officially allowed to agitate for and against, and are entitled to airtime and finance. Not so in this campaign.  “The vote was specially set up to avoid any debate,” says Grigory Melkonyants, co-chairman of the independent Golos election monitoring group. “The government can de facto agitate for a yes vote with their campaign literature, but activists campaigning for a no vote are being arrested as we speak.” There have been several early reports of manipulations. Some of the claims related to age-old techniques: for example, evidence of forced voting at large enterprises, where vulnerable, low-paid workers are asked to vote under management supervision. But there were examples of newer tricks too. Earlier this month, a reporter at the liberal Dozhd television network exposed a fraudulent scheme that registered the details of pensioners on electronic voting websites, with the aim of then voting on their behalf. The reporter was summoned by state investigators for his trouble. In the early hours of Thursday morning, another reporter for the same channel managed to vote twice — electronically and in person. That reporter would be fined 30,000 roubles (£350), election authorities confirmed. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not only is electronic voting possible in two cities – Moscow and Niznny Novgorod – but mobile voting at home and at work is being allowed without extenuating circumstances for the first time. There will be limited scope for independent oversight monitors will only be permitted from regional isions of the Public Chamber, a quasi-governmental organisation. “The vote is deliberately being held in the grey zone,” says Mr Melkonyants. “Those who want to cheat have a huge number of options, and it will be impossible to catch them.” Authorities at all levels, and across Russia’s 11 time zones, understand the importance of securing good numbers for the president. Acceptable figures vary “according to the levels of cynicism” of inidual actors, says Tatyana Stanovaya, director of political analysis firm RPolitik. For some, like Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, the target for yes votes is likely 70 per cent. For others, like Chechen president, Ramzan Kadyrov, the target will be nearer 100 per cent. “Overall, there is a sense that any result below 65 per cent would be a bad result,” Ms Stanovaya suggests.It seems a stretch to believe that the president would reach those figures in an entirely free election. A recent poll by the independent Levada Centre indicated that of those who were sure they would vote, 55 per cent would support the presidential amendments. But that figure drops below 50 per cent when it takes in all voters. Another poll by the same organisation suggested that just 25 per cent of Russians would vote for the amendments if they had a chance to vote for alternatives. Levada Centre is not the only polling organisation to register a haemorrhaging of support away from Russia’s president over recent years. How 20 years of Putin has shaped Russia and the worldAt the peak of his ratings, a year after the annexation of Crimea in June 2015, Mr Putin was supported by nine out of every 10 Russians. The same “closed” question elicits a positive answer from only 59 per cent today, and just 8 per cent of youngsters. In open polling, where respondents are asked to name the politicians they most trust for themselves – in what is considered most indicative of a free choice – Mr Putin was named by just 29 per cent of Russians. Sociologists at Levada registered the biggest falls following Mr Putin’s decision to push through unpopular pension reforms in 2018. Ms Stanovaya, however, traces the roots of an erosion of trust to 2017, when focus groups began to indicate growing disillusionment with the Kremlin’s focus on foreign campaigns in Syria and Ukraine.“The new challenges of the pandemic, low oil prices, and the constitution are catalysts for a process of erosion that began much earlier,” she says. Judging by the rush to get the vote done in the face of the pandemic, the fear among many in power would seem to be that the position is about to get even worse. “This is essentially a special operation from Putin, and special operations are all about reducing risks and mobilising quickly,” says Ms Stanovaya. “Waiting until the autumn would have meant inviting instability, the risk of a second coronavirus wave and social unrest that no one really knows how to deal with.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How could it not The sense of countryside and fresh air it evokes, the tweed caps, the fingerless mittens, the ornate walking stick . . .  just the innate Britishness of it all. Such a far cry from the smog, red carpets, bling and supercars of LA.And then, of course, it’s a reminder of the people he’s known since birth.Those who, unlike the “mwah mwah”, showbiz crowd, love him for who, rather than what, he is.Whichever way you view his behaviour of late, it’s undeniable that there is a huge, Harry-shaped hole in this image of family togetherness.Of course, there are Zoom meetings to be had and, post-lockdown, the occasional visit to be made. But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm. While the new name — Lost The Pot Noodle — is inspired, one notes that it now requires the consumer to put the ingredients in a mug or make it in a pan on the stove.As any self-respecting, Olympically idle student will tell you, a clean mug is a rarer sighting than an eclipse and, as for a pan, eventhey own one it will be housing enough penicillin growth to solve America’s recent shortage.So, memo to Unilever: Don’t phase out the original just yet.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Macro Rubio and others on June , . The submission raised concerns that the government has not devoted the appropriate amount of resources to UAP.The Committee remains concerned that there is no unied, comprehensive process within the federal government for collecting and analyzing intelligence on unidentied aerial phenomena, despite the potential threat, the committee states in its report on the bill.The bill orders the Director of National Intelligence to produce a thorough report with relevant agencies, including the FBI and the Office of Naval Intelligence. The unclassied report, which may include a classied annex, will contain details about a series of encounters with UAP and advanced aerial threats. Some of those encounters may not be with extraterrestrials, but instead adversaries of America testing the nations defenses.What’s more, the report must detail what information has been previously gathered on UAPs, how the data is collected and published, and what risks UFOs could pose.In April, the Pentagon declassied and released three videos taken by US Navy pilots showing mid-air encounters with what appeared to be UFOs.One of the videos was reportedly shot in November  and the other two in January . But exactly how much will be revealed in the new report depends on what the Pentagon deems unclassied.If the bill passes, the Pentagon will have  days to submit the report to Congress.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more.

On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination.

Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning.

Urgent steps must now be taken to remedy this absurd situation to ensure that no other hard-working iniduals are treated irrationally and to also ensure that those who have lost out financially are recompensed.”The DWP had initially argued that it was the fault of the employers but this has now been overturned.The government department said that fixing the issue would costs £.million and involve manually calculating benefit payments for those claimants who are affected by the loophole.Lady Justice Rose slammed the desperate situation caused by the benefit system perverse and that she cannot accept that the programme cannot be modied to make sure this doesnt happen.The problem affects those whos pay day can change depending on where a weekend or bank holiday falls in a particular month.For example, those who are paid on the last working day of the month are likely to be affected by this.Universal Credit is calculated based on your income during the same set period for every month, for example from the th of one month until the th of the next.But someone whos pay day is moved forward by a few days because their normal pay day would fall on a weekend or bank holiday could end up receiving two salary payments in one assessment period.Danielle, who was represented by Leigh Day solicitors, said: I find it unbelievable that the government has fought this case in the courts for so many years, it should not have taken the Court of Appeal to tell them something which is just a matter of common sense.The Suns Make Universal Credit Work campaign is demanding ministers make more changes to the system to help struggling Brits before its too late.We’ve told heartbreaking tales of how Brits are drowning in thousands of pounds worth of debt waiting for help, and have had to give up work due to the complicated childcare system.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People probably wont be allowed to pop into a museum or gallery on a whim, as these tickets may need to be pre-booked, according to guidance from the Government. Venues should also put in one-way systems where possible, to limit the number of people moving in and out of dferent rooms. The guidance suggests implementing wait or stop signs in busy areas. Foyers and assembly areas will be used for queuing, which will have to be socially distanced. Interactive exhibitions could also have to be ditched - meaning audio guides to museums could be banned. If museums want to keep them in place, the rules suggest thorough cleaning and quarantining them to limit the risk of germs lingering after visitors have used them. The guidance says: Museumsnew formats for the content such as apps that can be accessed on personal devices or quarantine periods for public handsets. Internal shops and cafes will have to follow the same social distancing advice as those outside of museums and galleries - including quarantining clothes which people have tried on, taking orders via apps, and putting screens in front of counters to protect staff. Visiting museums and galleries could mean a long hike up stairs, as venues have been advised to limit the use of lts to people with limited mobility. This is because lts are small, enclosed spaces where the risk of spreading coronavirus is higher. Where it isnt possible to follow the  metre social distancing rule, staff and visitors will have to follow the one metre plus rule which means staying  metre away and using extra precautions such as face masks.While the advice doesnt make face masks mandatory in museums or galleries, it advises managers to consider bringing them in for staff where they think it is necessary. Heritage sites will also be subject to the advice and will need clear floor markings showing visitors through via a one-way-system to stop crowds forming. The guidance also advised heritage sites to put in similar pre-booking systems in place to limit being flooded with visitors. All cultural attractions will have to reboot their cleaning regime and implement deep cleaning, but they will have to ensure it is completed in a way that does not damage the historic fabric of the buildings.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are pretty sure he was knocked unconscious under the water and he didn’t come back up again. “Ralph and I saw what was happening and we climbed over and started trying to pull him out. “His friend also climbed over and tried to pull him out, he was unconscious. “We were telling them to pull his head out of the water, and Ralph was trying to do that and had a hold of him and was swimming alongside him. “His friend then lost his grip on him and he started getting pushed down the river because of the current. “A fisherman jumped in and helped us to grab him and pull him out to put him on the side of the river. “That was when someone  started to perform CPR on him, the ambulance service were telling them what to do on the phone. “I tried to do CPR but I wasn’t strong enough so I asked for help. “After all of this another one of his friends had tried to save him by grabbing the leguard ring and ing in. “We were all focusing on the first man we didn’t realise the second one had been swept away.“Because my friends and I go there quite a lot we know to avoid the middle of the river because of the hotspots. “But these guys didn’t know where they shouldn’t jump and got sucked into the current.“I’ve been going there for a long time and nothing like this has ever happened before.”Ralph added: “A group of us were at the weir and suddenly I heard the guys screaming, three of them were in the water and one was unconscious. “They were trying to get him out, and when I heard the screaming I jumped in and climbed down the weir and tried to help them pull him out. “His head was really under the water, his friend seemed to lose his grip on him and he went even further under the water. “As he went down the river someone helped us to get him on the bank and then an older guy performed CPR on him. “I’m glad he’s alive, I know he’s in the hospital but I hope he is okay. There was a lot going on at that moment. “The part that they jumped into was probably the most dangerous part of the weir, we did try to find his friend but we didn’t want to risk it when we know what the currents are like. “It’s generally a pretty safe place to go and swim but I don’t think we will be going back there again.”Both boys jumped back in to try to save Syrian refugee Eyad after he had also tried to save his pal. Other members of the Syrian community in West London also travelled to the riverbank after learning their friend, , who lives in Uxbridge, had gone missing.Jacks mum Nicola Thomas said: “It’s heartbreaking for the boys to see all of this, and for the family of the man that it’s happened to. “I didn’t know whether to shout at Jack or hug him at first, because he’s put himself in danger jumping in but I am proud of him. “They definitely saved his le, there is no doubt about that.”The tragedy came as temperatures soared to around C on Tuesday as Britains heatwave continues.Officials from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews were at the riverside for almost three-and-a-half hours.A spokesman said: We are urging residents across Berkshire to take care near water.As the warm weather continues, it may be tempting to swim in open water, but there are many dangers involved.One of the main risks when entering the water is cold water shock, eventhe weather is warm.You also do not know what is beneath the surface – there could be unseen currents and reeds, which could pull you under.”LPA Commander for Windsor  Maidenhead, Superintendent Colin Hudson, said: “Officers have been working tirelessly with our partners to locate the man who entered the water yesterday, and have now tragically found a body.“We are grateful for the support we received from both Berkshire and Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Services, South Central Ambulance Service, and Berkshire Lowland Search and Rescue.“I would also like to thank members of the public who provided information as well as assistance to my officers.“I would like to thank them for their patience while officers investigated this incident, and we will be leaving the scene shortly.“I am very sorry to have to bring this sad news.“Our thoughts are with both men’s families during this very upsetting time.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I mean, I’ve only been able to see Dear Evan Hansen  times so far.And Christmas won’t be the same without the uniquely British tradition of the winter panto. How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Yesterday’s warning from Dame Judi Dench, who is , that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention

And while the Government and pub owners are hopeful that weaposre going to flock back to pubs, it looks like it is going to be a very dferent experience. The Prime Minister has given the go-ahead for pubs, restaurants and hotels to reopen as of next month - albeit with social distancing restrictions in place - while non-essential retail is already free to resume selling. It will be easier for pubs to change how they work It is a bit technical, but it is the change that makes all the other bits possible. The bill will change the way pubs ask local councils for permission on changing how they open. It will reduce the consultation period for applications for pavement licences to from  calendar days to  working days, and grant consent after  working daysthe council does not issue a decision And it lowers application fee for a pavement and street cafe licence to just £.  Get used to being outside With a hard limit on the number of people allowed to be inside a pub at any given time, you wonapost be propping up the bar anytime soon. In fact you wonapost be allowed to - inside people will have to be sat at a table to enjoy a drink. But perhaps the most noticeable change youaposll see at your local under under proposals laid out in the Business and Planning Bill, is that outside seating will become the norm. And to make that easier any outside areas that a pub has control over, like a car park, will be allowed to turn into seating areas.  You can take a pint homeAs part of the plans unveiled on Thursday, licensed premises will be able to serve booze for punters to take away and consume where in efforts to stop drinkers crowding indoors. While some pubs did this before and may have relied on it to keep themselves afloat during the lockdown, more pubs than ever will sell drinks for you to take home or drink off-premises in a bid to keep people as distanced as possible. More drinking space on the pavement outside pubs As part of the bill, Ministers are hoping to change how pubs get permission to set up on the pavements outside their doors. It will let a licence-holder to place removable furniture over certain highways adjacent to the premises. This is a streamlined process to allow businesses to secure these licences in time for the summer and allow these licences to remain in place for a year but not beyond  September   Youaposll also see more outdoor markets Meanwhile, outdoor markets, summer fairs and car boot sales will no longer need planning permission, meaning their hours can be extended without prior approval. Scientists have found that Covid- does not spread as easily in an outside environment compared to when indoors, meaning an outdoor lestyle could help keep the infection rate under control when lockdown measures are signicantly eased on July .

Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman refused to be drawn on the topic after it was missing from the PMaposs statement opening pubs, restuarants, bars, cinemas, hotels, campsites, hairdressers and places of worship.The reproduction number - aposRapos for short - is the average number of people who get infected by each person with coronavirus.If itaposs higher than one, the virus starts spreading exponentially and can run out of control.A month ago, when Boris Johnson schools and non-essential shops would reopen, he explicitly said the changes should keep aposRapos below one.But this time, when he revealed lockdown would ease on Tuesday, he did not repeat that claim. Instead the PM focused on the aposfive testsapos for easing lockdown to justy reopening huge areas of English society. Today Mr Johnsonaposs spokesman was askedhis scientic advisors had set out advice on how the new changes would affect aposRapos. But he refused to say. Instead he told journalists: As the PM set out, we believe the five tests continue to be met and that was the basis for reaching the decision.  “In terms of the R rate, the R rate for England under the most recently announced figures was . to ..” Asked again what the scientistsapos advice was, he told journalists: You don’t need to take my word for it - both Sir Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty were asked extensively earlier this week for their views on the package and they articulated them in full. Told the pair had not been asked a specic question about aposRapos, he replied: What they said is it was a reasonable balance of risk informed by reasonable professional judgements.  It comes after a leaked Public Health England briefing suggested the R number could already be above one in parts of England.The document, obtained by HuffPost UK, said because of uncertainty in how accurate the figure is, “we cannot preclude R being above ”.A previous model suggested it was already at or above one in the North West and South West - but the government insisted that model was only one of more than ten. The R number was put at the centre of the governmentaposs communications about easing lockdown in May. When he reopened schools and non-essential shops, the PM told England on May : This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown, while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together. And so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.

Robert Jenrick faces questions over his decision to approve a £bn housing development in London against the advice of a planning inspector. He gave Westferry Printworks, planned by billionaire Tory donor Richard Desmond, the green light on January  - hours before a council levy kicked in that would have cost the developer around £m. Itaposs since emerged Mr Desmond showed the minister a video of the scheme on his phone at a Tory fundraising dinner in November, and texted him asking him to approve it before the deadline. The new messages show that on November , Mr Desmond told him we donapost want to give Marxists in Tower Hamlets council loads of doe for nothing. In an e-mail dated January , a government official then said Mr Jenrick was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by the levy. Mr Desmond is not accused of wrongdoing, and Mr Jenrick has insisted that while there could have been an appearance of bias, there was no actual bias. Even so, the minister cancelled his approval to avoid a perception of bias in favour of the scheme. Downing Street today said the Prime Minister still had full confidence in Mr Jenrick, even though Mr Johnson spoke to the minister in recent days.

About half as big as the Sun, GJ  is just  light years away. Red dwarfs like GJ  have low surface temperatures, which makes them less luminous and often hard to detect. But stars like these are cooler than the Sun, which means the habitable zone - the orbital band where temperatures are mild enough to allow liquid surface water on orbiting planets - is much closer to GJ  in comparison with the Earthaposs distance from the Sun. The new planets, called GJ b and GJ c, were found using a high-precision, planet-finding instrument on the European Southern Observatoryaposs .-metre telescope at La Silla in Chile. Both are believed to be super-Earths - planets which have a mass higher than Earth but substantially below those of local ice giants Uranus and Neptune. The discovery was made by an international team of astronomers, including researchers from the University of Hertfordshire, The Open University and Queen Mary University of London. The scientists used a technique known as Doppler wobble, which enabled them to find the planets by measuring their gravitational interaction with GJ . As a planet orbits, it causes its parent star to wobble by a tiny degree. Astronomers can see the signature of this effect in the light emitted by the star. The researchers believe both GJ b and GJ c lie close to the inner edge of habitable zone and may be too hot to maintain liquid water on their surfaces. They estimate the surface temperature of GJ c, which takes . days to circle its host star, to be around C. GJ b, meanwhile, is much closer to the star, with an orbital period of . days. But the researchers say GJ  is less active than other red dwarfs, so the newly discovered worlds may be spared from strong stellar winds - outflowing material from the star which can erode a planetaposs atmosphere. Hence, the team are keen to learn more about this super-Earth system. Dr John Barnes, an astrophysicist at the Open University and one of the authors on the study published in the journal Science, said: Close orbiting planets like these have a high chance of being tidally locked to their host star. This means that as the planet orbits its star, the same hemisphere always faces the star. For the planets orbiting GJ , half of the planets would be in perpetual daytime and the other half in perpetual night time. So, it could be much cooler on some parts of the planets than others. The researchers also detected an unconfirmed signal, raising hopes of a third planet with a more temperate orbit. But Dr Barnes is cautious about this finding, saying: If the signal is a planet, it would orbit every  days.

Along with the help of their Norland Nanny Maria Borrallo, Prince William and Kate are determined to give their youngsters a happy childhood, but they also want to make sure theyaposre well-behaved.A source told the Sun that the trio has worked ferociously hard to make everything seem happy and relaxed while still teaching them the rules.They also claimed that Kate is slightly stricter than Wills. A source explained that Kate has ditched the traditional naughty step idea in favour of a aposchat sofaapos. They said that the misbehaving youngest is taken away from the scene and asked to sit on the sofa where William or Kate will have a quiet chat with them. They said: Things are explained and consequences outlined and they never shout at them. Shouting is absolutely ‘off limits’ for the children and any hint of shouting at each other is dealt with by removal. Speaking about nanny Maria Borralloaposs role in keeping the kids in line, the source said that her decisions are always in line with what Kate and Wills want. They said: “It is a military operation but you would never guess it because they work ferociously hard on their children’s upbringing and making it seem relaxed and happy for the three of them. They are very good at listening to the children but being firm.” Maria has worked with the Cambridge family since George was eight months old, and lives at Kensington Palace with them.

In his role of heir to the throne, the Queenaposs oldest son is entitled to the surplus generated by the Duchyaposs vast portfolio of land, buildings and financial investments.He uses the cash to fund his charity work and to support the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.In the - financial year, his annual private income from the hereditary estate rose by £, - .% - from £,, in - to £,,. However itaposs likely that next year will see a huge drop in profits due to the coronavirus pandemic, the secretary and keeper Alastair Martin has warned. He said: The lockdown resulting from Covid- was only in place for one week of the financial year that this report covers. There is therefore very limited financial impact on these results. As to -, it is too early in the new financial year to be able to say with any confidence what the impact on our financial performance will be, but, despite having a particularly well-ersied asset base, we fully expect the revenue surplus to be down by a signicant amount, in large part due to our trading enterprises being closed. He added: We have not availed ourselves of the ious government pandemic support schemes but have continued to pay all staff.  Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, called for the Government to take control of the estate and stop the prince keeping the surplus.Graham Smith, chief executive of the pressure group, said: There is simply no justication for this ludicrous amount of money to be thrown at Charles when public services are stretched and local communities are impacted by the coronavirus.Itaposs time the Duchy was rolled back into the Crown Estate and its income served the British people, not one prince.  He added: We do not owe Charles a living. This nonsense has to stop. The total worth of the Duchyaposs assets - amounting to more than £ billion - has dropped by nearly £ million. It fell from £,,, to £,,,, but much of the decrease is linked to valuation of the Duchyaposs investment property at the end of March amid the Covid- outbreak. The report said valuation experts were taking into account the uncertain property market and had cited that less certainty, and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to the valuations. The Duchy said that the volatility and uncertainty posed no short or long term financial threat to the asset values of its properties. The private landed estate was created in  by Edward III to support his son and heir Prince Edward, known as the Black Prince, and all his subsequent heirs. It extends across  counties in England and Wales and includes the Oval cricket ground and , acres of Dartmoor. Mr Martin said the coronavirus crisis had caused signicant personal and financial disruption for many Duchy tenants, particularly in the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall, where the economy is reliant on tourism and hospitality. He highlighted the uncertain future and pledged to work with the tenants to help them in the wake of the pandemic. It is unclear how the coming year will unfold. During this dficult and anxious time for the Duchy family, we will continue to maintain close links with all our tenants and work with them to re-establish, where possible, their livelihoods, he said. Rent deferrals have been agreed with many tenants, he added. The report also highlighted legislative hiatus over the UKaposs departure from the EU as having an impact. Uncertainty arising from this hiatus makes planning and investment decisions more complex. This is an area of deep concern for our agricultural tenants in particular, it said. Charles uses his Duchy income to pay for his official duties, his London office and charitable work.He also funds the public duties of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and some of William and Kateaposs private costs.He will have done the same for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from his - income. Harry and Meghan quit as senior royals in March at the end of the financial year.

As the sun rose early this morning there were scenes of devastation on beaches such as Bournemouth and Brighton on the south coast. Tents were left on Bournemouth beach overnight along with piles of rubbish such as empty beer and cider bottles, takeaway food bags and discarded cans of Strongbow. A dog walker in Brighton wrote on Twitter: Went for an early morning walk with our dog. What is wrong with people  Loads of rubbish on the beach everywhere.  I feel for the street cleaners. Take your rubbish home or go to the next bin where it isn’t full, there’s plenty of them. It wasnapost just beaches with piles of rubbish left by revellers, similar scenes have been reported at the Meadows in Edinburgh, on Blackheath common in south east London and in Hyde Park in central London. At Hove Lawns, where pockets of violence broke out last night, rubbish was also left on the seafront, including dozens of metal cannisters used to inhale nitrous oxide - also known as aposhippy crackapos. Last night police estimated there were up to , revellers present at Hove Lawns when officers arrived after being called at .pm. Officers issued a dispersal order to clear the scene after fighting erupted among the huge group of teenagers.An eyewitness told  The Argus:  There are ten police cars and all the kids are walking around shouting at police – it’s like football chants.  All the police have pulled up and are walking along trying to get them to move. Another said: It was like a stand-off between hundreds of youths and police. Local councillor Chris Henry said: Hove Lawns tonight shows how badly solutions for young people are needed and how youth services are needed more than ever.The weather is set to be even hotter today with beaches expected to be packed again - with locals fearing similar scenes throughout the summer with people wary of going to pubs and preferring to drink in the sunshine.  Natalie Joyce wrote on Twitter : I am genuinely confused by the state of some of Dorsetaposs beaches today.I cannot get my head around why people would leave their rubbish and think that it is ok ! No one actually knowsit is locals or people who have travelled to the area, either way - it is bang out of order! Writing about the pictures from Bournemouth Angie said: And the downside of living in Bournemouth. Selfish, entitled humans. aposI want to go to the beach, I don’t careothers do too, I want to eat, get tanned and then leave my rubbish for someone apos. At famous beauty spot Durdle Door  bags of rubbish were reported to have been collected by volunteers. The rubbish included small suitcases, disposable barbecues and broken parasols.The Met Office said temperatures in west London could reach C today , while parts of Wales could see the mercury rise to C .However, the good weather is due to change on Thursday afternoon with thunderstorms forming across the west of the UK.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who quit their royal le in Britain to set up home in Los Angeles, have struck a deal with the New York-based Harry Walker Agency. Former President Barack Obama reportedly earned almost £, for one  speech, while the Clintons averaged almost £, per appearance in . It is unclear what speaking fees will be for the Duke and Duchess, who will speak both together or inidually, the Los Angeles Times reported. A source close to Harry and Meghan reportedly confirmed the couple had signed with the agency, which industry insiders say will net them millions as they seek “financial independence” away from the royal family. It is expected they will offer their services as keynote speakers with big money corporations and community forums in future. Harry in February spoke at an event hosted by investment banking giant JP Morgan where he revealed he had been in therapy for the past three years. The Duke’s team had held discussions with Goldman Sachs about forming a partnership.  However, Majesty magazine editor Ingrid Seward has warned that Harry and Meghan may have to tell stories about their time in the royal family to justy their fees. She said: No one wants to pay to hear them sounding off about gender equality and the environment.Harry and Meghan will really have to up their ante, and they will absolutely have to tell some stories about the Royal Family.

Temperatures are expected to his C this weeks, so Brits will be digging out the paddling pools, deck chairs and Factor . While we love soaking up those rays when we get to sit outside, itaposs not so much fun when weaposre stuck in our hot homes working from home - and itaposs resulted in many people missing their office air conditioning. So what can we do to keep  cool during the daytime and when weaposre trying to sleep  Lucy Askew from curtain and blinds company Hillaryaposs has shared a few tips to make the next week more bearable. She told : The weather is so up and down at the moment it can sometimes be hard to keep track. By the time the heatwave is upon us, everyoneaposs ran out and purchased a fan leaving shelves empty and others without a source of cool air. If the queues are too long and you’re worried about them being sold out of the items you are looking for, then these simple tips will help you to keep temperatures down when the weather is scorching. It is important to keep the house cool, especiallyyou have children or pets around, so they don’t overheat, and those who might be strapped for cash or counting their pennies can also use these tips without having to spend a penny.” Use blinds shutters curtains to block out any sunlight Keeping your house cool is essential during a heatwave and,you find that your house lets in direct sunlight, especially in the afternoon, you could find that conditions quickly become unbearable. If your house does experience more sunlight throughout the day then it’s recommended you keep your curtains, shutters and blinds shut to stop the sunlight from beaming into your home. This will keep things marginally cooler and slightly more bearable during heatwaves.    Stay hydrated It’s imperative that you drink plenty of water during any heatwave keep your fridge stocked up with bottled water and consider putting some in the freezer that you can use as ice blocks for when the temperature reaches its peak in the afternoon. It is important to keep your body hydrated so you do not end up suffering from heat stroke or dehydration headaches and migraines. Have warm showers    A lot of people think that cold showers will help to keep you cool but in fact, warm showers are actually far more effective in cooling you down when your body temperature is running hot.   A warmshower will initially feel worse than a cold shower but, because a freezing cold shower closes your pores shut, within a few minutes of taking the shower you will end up feeling warmer than you did beforehand as your initial core temperature releases.   Drink tea coffee Whilst you may crave a nice cold drink during a heatwave, it has been said that drinking hot drinks like tea or coffee will actually counteract the heat and cool your body quicker than cold drinks.    "},{"url":null,"title":"mums disbelief teachers note contents","story":"NewsMums disbelief at teachers note about contents of daughters lunchboxMum-of-three Melissa Anne didnt know whether to cry, laugh or shake her head in disbelief when her daughters teacher told her what she found inside Emilys lunchboxShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mums-disbelief-teachers-note-contents-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

But when it comes to keeping your babies hydrated, experts are urging new parents not to give their little ones water - no matter how warm it is outside. It may seem like common sense - especially since weaposve been told water is good for us since we were children - but giving your baby water can be extremely dangerous. As a first time parent itaposs only natural to feel overwhelmed with the vast amount of information out there. But this is one risk that new parents cannot ignore. Do babies need water  The short answer is, no. Up until the age of six months, babies should not be given water at all.Once they reach six months old they can be given a sip of water here or there but itaposs not necessary as according to Katie Zeratsky, a dietitian at the Mayo Clinic, they can actually live without water until theyaposre a year old. She told Buzzfeed : They get all of their fluid needs through human milk or infant formula. Even on a hot day they can get all of their hydration needs through human milk or formula.Why is it dangerous  Milk provides all of the nutrients a baby needs, from protein, vitamins and minerals to carbohydrates and fats. Babies develop quickly when theyaposre little so itaposs vital to ensure they receive everything they need to grow big and strong.Pharmacist Abbas Kanani told Yahoo UK : Their stomachs are so tiny and can fill up easily with water, making it dficult for them to get the nourishment they require.He adds: Giving water to an infant can affect the baby’s ability to receive adequate nourishment. What happensbabies drink water  Water consumption under the age of six months can lead to water intoxication. Katie says: Water intoxication is where you consume too much water in a short period of time and your blood level of sodium drops…making a tragic situation.

They failed in the play-offs last year, of course, but this year they got the right signing in Lawrence Shankland to win the title.“That made all the dference for them, scoring those goals, and they did get a wee bit steadier at the back.“Robbie would’ve known they’d have needed two or three players more for going up but I thought he’d still be there for the fight.“He’ll just have it all to do with Hearts again in that league.”As for who will lead the Terrors into the top flight, McAlpine says it’s anybody’s guess.Whether it’s Tommy Wright, Craig Levein or Lee McCulloch, the former goalie reckons they’ll have a job on their hands.LEE WILKIE: Craig Levein and Peter Houston could steady the ship for Dundee United\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Craig Levein and Peter Houston could steady the ship for Dundee United# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-craig-levein-peter-houston-dundee-united embed # secretiNuOtGIDF\" data-secret\"iNuOtGIDF\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"However, McApline insists the club remain in a strong, attractive position for a new man coming in.“There’ll be plenty folk out of a job who’ll be desperate to take it,” he added.“With the crowds they can pull in they can have success.

If players are sold then we might get the opportunity to look at that.“Certainly we won’t be adding to the squad .”Aberdeen have the vast majority of their first-team squad secured on contracts for the next season or beyond.Only number two keeper Tomas Cerny is out of contract and the Dons have already opened contract talks to extend his stay at the club.It is understood any possible new addition would be made on the basis of one out, one in –the Dons were to sell a player.McInnes and club chairman Dave Cormack have both recently stated there will be no cut-price sale of players in the summer, despite the club’s financial losses due to the pandemic.Aberdeen beat off competition from newly-promoted Dundee United and a number of English Championship clubs to secure theof Hayes to Pittodrie.The Republic of Ireland international winger starred for the Dons for five years until transferring to Celtic in summer .Hayes won the League Cup with the Dons during his first spell and racked up more than  appearances.During his first spell at Aberdeen, Hayes was utilised as a winger and terrorised full-backs with his pace, direct play and skill.However, last season at Celtic he played in the left-back role.Aberdeen had hoped to secure the permanent signing of NAC Breda left-back Greg Leigh, who had been on loan last season.However, the financial impact of the coronavirus derailed that permanent move for Leigh.McInnes has not ruled out revisiting a move for Leigh when the club emerges from the coronavirus crisis.McInnes is delighted to have a player of Hayes’ quality at the club to strengthen that left-hand side for the next two seasons.He said: “Jonny has demonstrated his ability to play in a number of positions – full-back, wing-back and as a wide player over the last few seasons.“Having Jonny operating on that left-hand side, regardless of where we ask him to play, we still expect a high level of performance.“It is great having that type of quality and person in the building again. He’s the kind of person you want at your club and I think he’s a brilliant signing for us.”Hayes met up with his new team-mates this week as the squad go through socially- distanced training at the £m Cormack Park.McInnes insists the training facility has been a “godsend” as the Dons prepare for the start of the Premiership on August .He said: “The fact we have Cormack Park and the challenges we face currently with all the protocols we need to meet – having the luxury of so much space is a godsend.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 8 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRegular contributor Aileen Gillies sent us this week#s photograph, which she has called #What ewe looking at #."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRumour has it the UK government will bring in a -day quarantine for some # but not all # airline passengers at the end of this month.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.When attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends, had part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh, and a recently ex-long-term boyfriend.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgerwas described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

Miranda, , who also worked on the Moana movie soundtrack, is something of a polymath and already, his awards include three Tonys, three Grammys, an Emmy and also a Pulitzer for drama in honour of Hamilton.A global hit Prior to lockdown, Hamilton was still pulling them in on Broadway, with a production in Chicago and a touring show across North America. Sir Cameron Mackintosh produced a London show that began in , but it was halted due to the pandemic, as were planned productions in Hamburg and Sydney.Now Theatre impresario Sir Cameron announced earlier this month that all of his West End shows, including Hamilton, were cancelled until next year and he pointed to an absence of help from the government, saying there had been \"no tangible practical support beyond offers to go into debt which I dont want to do.Hamilton the movie Originally intended to screen in cinemas in October next year, Hamilton the movie has been brought forward by  months to fill the gap for bereft theatre fans. It is the filmed version of the original Broadway production, shot over several days in the week before the main principal cast members began to leave in .Cast Miranda plays Hamilton, with other stars including Jonathan Groff, who plays Kristoff in the Frozen movies and Holden Ford in the Netflix series, Mindhunter, as King George III.Alexander Hamilton Born in the British West Indies, Hamilton , who features on the  bill, had Scottish roots - his father, James Hamilton, was the fourth son of the Laird of Grange in Ayrshire, before moving abroad.

Not today. The mask might have lain there for weeks, but it felt better to leave it for someone with rubber gloves to deal with. In the coming months, I suspect paper masks will become the new crisp packet or plastic water bottle, the leading litter offender of our times. Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us. Who ever thought we would be having this dialogue  It was a sobering moment, stark proof of how altered the world has become in a matter of months.The fabric visors I have on order are as non-medical as it gets, short of the Venice carnival. If Laura Ashley were still in business, I could have lurked unnoticed among the rails in one of these for days. Perhaps wisely, my husband has opted instead for the Ned Kelly look. With a hill-walking snood pulled up over his nose he looks dastardly, and warm. With the hottest days of the year approaching, wearers will be severely tested. It is no joke. On overheated buses, tubes and trains ndash often tropical even in winter ndash being cocooned behind cloth, wool or paper will raise temperatures to simmering point. Tempers might follow. This is no time, certainly, for the menopausal. It will be interesting to see what happensanyone finds it so unbearable a prospect that they dare to go bare-faced.So far the enforcement of lockdown measures has been largely consensual, the police working amicably to ensure peoplersquos safety. Butany passengers revolt or feel unwell when under wraps, who will handle that situation  Itrsquos simple enough to prevent refusniks getting on at the bus stop, but thereafter the driver cannot be expected to enforce the law. Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off. Learning to do that now will require mentally airbrushing out the red flags in the scene before us, be it perspex screens, the distance between tables, or a proleration of nosebags.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back. Which would be most interesting at a conference or reception ndash assuming we ever have them again.Professor Linda Bauld, of Public Health at Edinburgh University says politicians should ldquonot to get too hung up about distance. There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule. Public transport becomes unmanageable, tourism is undermined, shops and offices stay closed. We are a gregarious species and trying to keep two metres away from our fellow man and woman is extraordinarily dficult.Children are not observing anything like a two metre rule in parks and gardens, as is only too obvious. It seems absurd therefore that they should be prevented from attending well managed and clean schools where the risk will be very much less.:CMO warnshealthboards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityMany parents were outraged at Mr Swinneyrsquos ldquoblended learning plans, with some pupils getting as little as a day of teaching per week. They made their feelings very plain to the Deputy First Minister and he appears to have got the message.Mr Swinney is now sounding more bullish than Boris Johnson about reopening the schools full time from August th.

Flagging up the statement Nicola Sturgeon made yesterday, the PM gazed into his crystal ball and predicted it would be ldquouncannily similar to the one that Irsquove just given.He was right, to some extent. The beer gardens of Scotland shall, like those in England, open. Hairdressers will snip, friends and family will meet indoors, cinemas will screen films. While the FM did not go as far as Mr Johnson in lting the two metre rule, that looks likely to follow next week. Between this and the U-turn on schools, the pace of change is positively dizzying. It is like going on an extended ride on the waltzers.:PM takes a swipe at Sturgeon for uncannily similar briefingsEngland, under Mr Johnsonrsquos plan, will go further and faster. If anyone doubts how nakedly populist the PM is being, just take a look at the date for the easing of lockdown to begin ndash July , Independence Day in the US. When it comes to Scotland, independence remains a four letter word. Otherwise, Downing Street is delighted to celebrate the concept.But here we are, getting ahead of ourselves. As the Prime Minister made clear, the virus is still out there, andit becomes clear that there is a surge in new cases lockdown restrictions could be reimposed.Really, Mr Johnson, who do you think you are kidding  Now that people are only too aware of how miserable le in lockdown can be, it would take a brave and uniquely gted premier to persuade the public back into that jail cell, and we know Mr Johnson is neither.He is acting quickly because of the economic catastrophe we, and the rest of the world, are facing. And to please his own backbenchers and party backers, of course. One might have a sneaking admiration for himhe came straight out and admitted to the latter, instead of trying to convince us that he is acting according to a well-thought out plan. If the strategy was that oven-ready, businesses in England would not have been hammering on Downing Streetrsquos door on Tuesday seeking clarication.As the PM spoke at what was to be the last daily briefing, Chris Whitty, Englandrsquos chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientic adviser, displayed obvious caution. When it came to the relaxation of the two metre rule they did not so much socially distance themselves from Mr Johnson as figuratively pick up their podiums and move to a neighbouring county. Professor Whittyrsquos assessment was frank. ldquoIf people donrsquot take the mitigation seriously,people hear a distorted version of whatrsquos being said that says lsquoThis is all fine, itrsquos gone away,rsquo yes we will get an uptick ndash for sure.He is not the only one concerned. A letter to the British Medical Journal, signed by the leaders of all the major medical and nursing bodies, warned that ldquothe available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk. We know the truth of that already from the experiences of Germany and South Korea, two countries massively more successful than the UK in dealing with the pandemic.The letter urged the UK Government to look at how well prepared the country is for a second wave. That warning must be heeded. Much has been made by Governments across the UK of how they have been dealing with unprecedented and fast-moving events that they could not have seen coming.That was always debatable . As the virus spread from China to mainland Europe it was plain what was needed and what worked. Yet the lockdown came too slowly and the testing strategy was abandoned too quickly. Being unprepared for a second wave will be inexcusable, and that goes for Edinburgh as much as London, Belfast and Cardf.It is fear of a second wave that has been cited as the reason for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos more hesitant approach to easing the lockdown. The FM has indeed played cautious cop to Mr Johnsonrsquos all-over-the-shop cop, the Juliet Bravo to his Jack Regan of The Sweeney.Both have made mistakes. There has been too much hiding behind the skirts of science instead of taking the lead. Too many pronouncements made from podiums instead of finding out what it has really been like living in lockdown.:Guy Stenhouse:  Comparing Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon is an interesting exerciseThat is why there was such anger over the travels of Catherine Calderwood and Dominic Cummings. It is also why the policy of blended learning was never going to survive contact with reality.From the start of this crisis people have wanted to be treated like grown ups. Edinburgh and London are finally catching up with that. There needs to be more straight talking about the risks and dangers that lie ahead. Key to charting a way through them, and getting ahead of a second wave, is a fully ing system to test, track and isolate. Let us not take our eye off that prize.Mr Johnson has more need for candour than the First Minister. Of the two, she has been the more forthright and credible. As such, only the wilder elements in her party would even think of calling for her to gothere is a second wave that could have been prevented.You can bet your last mask, however, that should the worst happen in England the Conservatives will dump Mr Johnson. They have never really warmed to him and they certainly do not trust him. He was sufficiently appealing to a large enough swathe of the electorate in England to win a General Election and save their seats, and that was what mattered to them.Then the virus arrived and showed that they had been right all along about his weaknesses. He was lazy, ill-prepared, and indecisive. A follower when a leader was needed.If there is one thing on which all sides can agree is that in time there must be an inquiry into the handling of this crisis. How much easier for Mr Johnsonrsquos partythey could blame their mistakes on someone who had departed for the backbenches.

If you were looking for an archetypal hard-bitten tabloid hack who embodied the highs and lows of the trade, then Iain Calder was your man.The former Daily Record reporter was something of a star in Scandalous! The Tabloid that Changed America, a look at the rise and plummet of the National Enquirer. Cynical, sharp, bursting with stories ndash had you requested him from central casting you would have sent him back for being too much of a cliche.But that was the Enquirer, according to this superb Storyville documentary: always too much for its own good.Mark Landsmanrsquos -minute film swung between two attitudes to the paper and what it had brought to journalism.The first, typied by Carl Bernstein, was censorious. The Enquirer should be looked at in the realm of popular culture rather than journalism, snfed the Watergate warrior by way of an introduction.But then the story of its origins and early operations began and the film was off to the races, half awed by the tale and more than a little amused.Bought in the s with mob money , the title was owned outright by Generoso Pope Junior, the son of an Italian newspaperman. Legend has it that ldquoGene was driving along a highway when he saw people rubbernecking an accident. The Enquirer had found the first of its specialisms: gore porn. Circulation went up to one million but Pope wanted  million. To do that the paper had to go where readers went, into the supermarkets. Out went the gore and in came celebrity news, gossip, dogs, medical oddities, psychics, UFOs and general wackadoodle doo. Stories were to be ldquoexploded, sensationalised, and for that Pope needed the best, some might say worst, in the business: Fleet and McFleet Streetrsquos finest.Calder led the exodus. By age  he had worked on the Falkirk Sentinel, the Stirling Journal, Falkirk Mail, and the Daily Record . Unable to find the skills and attitude he wanted among the American media, Calder recruited from home. It was a second colonisation of America, and the locals reacted about as well as they did the last time the Brits came.The main change ushered in by the Enquirer was that it paid for information. From this, the film argued, the rot set in. Irsquom not sure American journalism was always that holier than thou hitherto, but the Enquirer certainly encouraged others to follow its methods and madness. Why  Because it was phenomenally successful. The edition with a photo of Elvis in his coffin sold seven million.Some scandals were filed away, as when a female reporter found out about Bill Cosbyrsquos many infidelities. Calder spiked the story to get softer interviews from the star. ldquoI was making trades that would make our readers happier, said Calder today.For a time, where the Enquirer led the mainstream media followed, particularly on OJ Simpson.But when it got it wrong it got it dreadfully wrong, as when the paper ran a picture of Dianathe day before the Princess died in Paris. From there it was a quick slide into further infamy. And then The Donald showed up. The paper, under new ownership, began to ldquocatch and kill stories, a lot of them unfavourable to candidate Trump as he became. The cover up, says Bernstein, was the ldquoultimate corruption.Terric use of archive, a dream cast of talking heads, and a solid, clear narrative made Scandalous this weekrsquos must see documentary.The Enquirer would not touch The Great British Sewing Bee with a metre stick. The reality show, which reached its final last night, has been far too nice to attract tabloid attention. Why, these contestants even helped each other outthere was a problem.While it was short on anything approaching real drama, the GBSB had enough going for it in genial host Joe Lycett, a worthy winner in s enthusiast Dr Clare, and judges, Esme Young and Patrick Grant, who knew their stuff.

Current evidence supports the two-metre guidance in many locations, occupations and industries because of airborne as well as large droplet transmission. Past research underestimates viral airborne risks. Evidence from clusters supports more caution. The R rate is still not low enough across the UK for change but it is as low as it is partly because of the two-metre distancing.There is also still limited evidence to support a reduction below two metres and the latest WHO-funded study on one and two metres is not conclusive and has been attacked as inadequate. Yet even that acknowledges two metres is more protective than one.Current evidence supports the general importance of the combined use of social distancing, use of masks and other PPE and handwashing, not removing or reducing parts of this strategy. There must also be continued employment, wage protection and suspension of punitive sickness absence and performance management system, to encourage safe practices including self-isolation.We have not yet seen the review that the Prime Minister apparently used to make his decision. This is not transparent and informed decision-making.

We aim to change that.ldquoVisitors... are inclined to go to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses and the Heritage Centre then carry on along the coast. We think the memorial garden will be enough of a distinctive attraction that people will stop in the town centre as well.Born in June , Glover spent the first six years of his le in Fraserburgh, at that time a rapidly expanding fishing and trading port.Upon leaving school in , he took a job as a shipping clerk with the Jardine Matheson trading company, later joining its Far Eastern operation and accepting a posting to Shanghai.There he sold opium to middlemen and traded in silks, tea and guns before relocating to Nagasaki as the old order disintegrated.He was a key figure in the Mitsubishi conglomeratersquos early growth, building links with Scottish shipyards and playing an instrumental role in bringing students to universities north of the Border.Echoing his achievements, proposals for the Fraserburgh memorial envisage a courtyard garden which will double as a community and interpretation space offering information about Gloverrsquos role in the creation of modern Japan.A monument and pine tree inspired by his famous Nagasaki garden, which he named ldquoIpponmatsua , are also planned, while low, evergreen ground-cover will reference the ldquomossy mounds characteristic of traditional Japanese horticulture.The memorial, designed with the help of RankinFraser Landscape Architects, is one of a range of projects being taken forward as part of a pound. million investment in the new Fraserburgh Central Conservation Area over a five-year period to March .ldquoThe wider regeneration project is very signicant because Fraserburgh, certainly over a long period, had become quite run down, said Ms Simpson.ldquoWhat we still have of Glover is the place he knew as a child and there are a great many buildings in the town that were part of the place when he lived there.ldquoWe are using modern conservation principles to make it quite clear where design is fresh and modern.

Many other parents worried schools might not be safe enough for .Teachers busied themselves getting their classrooms ready for social distancing.

As a result, on Tuesday, the policy changed.Now the plan is for schools to reopen full-time in August without social distancing. Why  Whatrsquos changed  Apparently, according to Swinney, when it comes to the pandemic, ldquothe picture looks more positive.Forgive me,I donrsquot believe this. Only a fool would think that this country ndash along with many other nations which have handled coronavirus much more successfully ndash isnrsquot heading for a second wave. Surgeons, nurses and GPs all fear a second wave.Countries which have eased lockdown are experiencing spikes and clusters. France recorded  new cases of coronavirus in  hours and is investigating five new clusters, bringing the total number of clusters in the country to .

Therersquos been more than  deaths here. In the UK, therersquos been more than ,. Scotland has roughly a tenth of the UKrsquos population. The figures speak for themselves.How is this a ldquopositive picture as Swinney claims  Understandably, parents are even more worried now. Before, it seemed that it was just their childrenrsquos education which would suffer. Now, parents worry about ato school without social distancing measures. Theyrsquore also more confused than ever. Swinneyrsquos announcement clashes with much of the information theyrsquore receiving from schools about their childrenrsquos education.Teachers are also worried. Theyrsquore genuinely scared. Theyrsquore being asked to go into their classrooms unsuregovernment guidance is sufficient to protect them. Nobody should be expected to go to work fearful. Teachers also feel used. They worked hard to put the \"blended\" model in place ndash now thatrsquos gone. So, itrsquos little wonder that teachers are angry with the SNP.The SNPrsquos dithering, confused messaging on education appears simply cruel when it comes to teachers, parents and children.But the most repellent aspect of the whole fiasco is the crowing and gloating and politicking by our MSPs and their party apparatchiks. Once Swinney switched from the blended model to a straightforwardto school, opposition MSPs were up on their hind legs bragging about a \"u-turn\". They had won. The SNP had been humiliated.The SNP, of course, said it wasnrsquot a u-turn. The blended model remained as a contingency planthe infection worsened. There were caveats, the nationalists said, so therersquod been no volte faceHerersquos the truth: it was a u-turn ndash but nobody cares. The SNP did cave in to pressure from parents and opposition parties, and wersquoll all have to wait and seethat capitulation was safe and sensible. To claim this isnrsquot a u-turn is to reinvent the concept of geometry, and political language.However, outside the incestuous bubble of Holyrood no-one gives a damn. Parents care about their children. Teachers care about their safety and their pupils. Who would spare even a thought to the pride and ego of the political class And this is what sickens most of all. Our politicians think that moving the debate from the future of our childrenrsquos education to the issue of whether they got a political win out of this or not is acceptable. It shows how deeply these people are out of touch with the rest of us.Party politics in inimical to the interests of the people. Political parties take a position, their rivals take the opposite position, and they dig in. It doesnrsquot matter whatrsquos good for us. Like generals in the First World War, they draw their lines and the casualties are the little people, the rank and file.The only issue that matters is that our children get a good education, that parents feel their children are safe and prospering, and that teachers feel protected at work. Thatrsquos all we should care about. Politics should be inconsequential.Parents, teachers and, most of all, children are being failed by our political class.

He grew up in Yorkshire and signed for Hull when he was . He might then have stayed on at Hull and had a great career there, but he left, and played in America, then came to Scotland where Kilmarnock wanted him, then went off to Canada and lots of other places and none of it ever felt very comfortable for him and a big part of the reason for that was his sexuality.But now, this week, Thomas has gone public, making him only the second male professional footballer in the UK to reveal hersquos gay. Without doubt, itrsquos an important step for sport and for LGBT equality, but because Thomas retired in , it doesnrsquot actually change the fact that there still isnrsquot a single out gay man playing in the professional game in Britain. There was Justin Fashanu in the s, but thatrsquos it.The fact Thomas has waited until now to talk openly is understandable: when, who, andgay people reveal their sexuality is up to them, but the problem is that the football industry was, and is, unwelcoming for gay men. Watfordrsquos captain Troy Deeney said the other day that every football team is likely to have a gay player. The fact that not a single one of them is public tells you everything you need to know.The problem boils down to three parts: players, management, and the fans, and the pressure they are exerting, possibly unconsciously, on players to stay silent. Right across the game, people are making assumptions about what football is and what masculinity is and how the two interact and gay men are picking it up from a very early age.Take the players first. Thomas Beattie says that when he signed as a youth professional with Hull, the senior players took him to a strip club as an initiation. The other players assumed Thomas would enjoy a strip club they had assumed he was heterosexual. He also says he heard gay slurs in the changing room, although he doesnrsquot think the players were being malicious ndash they were saying it because they assumed there was no one in the room to be hurt or offended.Management is also a problem. Thomas says therersquos still an assumption that a gay player would disrupt the team, in the same way that the British Army used to assume a gay soldier would lead to the army losing wars because it was too gay. Thomas also believes that, because society generally is getting better, managers assume homophobia isnrsquot an issue in football either and therefore do nothing.Then therersquos the fans. Can we be confident thatThomas had stayed on at Kilmarnock or Hull or any other team and had come out as gay that he wouldnrsquot have faced abuse from the fans  Thomas says he felt like society was telling him the world of being gay and being a footballer were enemies andyoursquore a football fan, it might be worth asking yourself what assumptions you make. Have you ever thought, for example, thata man is gay he probably canrsquot kick a ball All of these assumptions played their part in making Thomas unhappy and, although they donrsquot necessarily translate into outright abuse, they do the job just as well. You canrsquot be gay and a footballer. Being gay will be bad for the team. Yoursquore a footballer therefore you love the ladies.The solution is for everyone in the game to check their assumptions. Thomas puts it this way: be conscious of the environment yoursquore creating and whether it lets everyone feel included. When a new player joins the team, do not assume theyrsquore straight. Maybe a few players will be offended by this, but gay players will feel more welcome and more able in the long run to go public.Everyone should also listen to what Thomas Beattie says about the longer term consequences of football failing to change. ldquoDo not fear the day where a gay athlete is wearing the badge on your shirt, he says. ldquoFear the prolonged period of time when there isnt. In other words, football could be missing out on great players, but even worse than that: as society and other sports progress, football is going to look more out-of-date on the issue of sexuality and ndash letrsquos just say it ndash homophobic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

When the survey was carried out in , the figure was %.According to NRS figures there are now , humanist marriages, compared with , Christian marriages and , marriages of other religions.There were also , civil ceremonies conducted by registrars in .Humanist Society Scotland chief executive Fraser Sutherland said: \"These new official statistics show again how humanist ceremonies have become a mainstay of Scottish public le. The new figures also show that Humanist Society Scotland celebrants have solemnised the biggest percentage share of total weddings we have ever had - showing that more couples are opting for a meaningful humanist ceremony than ever before.\"This is a reflection of the trend we have seen in Scotland where - particularly since the mid th century - each generation has become less religiously observant than their parents.\"There are a huge iety of reasons behind this but improved scientic literacy in schools and a reduction in parents bringing children up in a faith are two major factors.\"Indeed I would say the parenting one is the biggest factor as the majority, though not all, of people begin to form their religious beliefs in childhood.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households. Further details to follow in coming days.July  — Outdoor sports to resume and shopping centres to reopen.July  —  Meeting  indoors with up to two other households to be allowed, with physical distancing and attention to hygiene indoor learning and childcare service to resumeholiday accommodation, museums, galleries, monuments, cinemas and libraries to reopen . This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis. But before you head for a drink, you#ll be able to get that much-needed chop at the hairdressers or barbers.Ms Sturgeon explained that other Phase Three plans, such as communal gatherings including weddings and funerals, will require further consideration. Changes to guidance around this is unlikely to take effect before July .The First Minister also confirmed Scotland#s aim to move away from blanket guidance for all shielding people, with hopes instead of more tailored advice.She said: #Our challenge, which is not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping this virus firmly under control.#If, at any stage, there appears to be a resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted — and we may need to go backwards.#To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England. Yesterday, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster said the Executive would also look at reinstating the summer free school meals voucher schemefunds were available."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3186331.jpg--.jpg?1592830393000\n","title":"free drive in cinema for ballee but get your tickets fast","story":"Ballee Playing Fields is set to be transformed into a drive-in cinema with FREE admission for all on Saturday th July.The movies on the bill are Trolls and .The event is being delivered by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council as part of the intergeneration, cross community St.ART project which is funded by the European Union’s PEACE IV Programme and is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .It will be a ticket only event and tickets are available through Eventbrite from Monday nd June.The afternoon showing of Trolls will take place at :pm and  will be shown at :pm so bag your tickets and get the popcorn ready.Sound will be transmitted via the car radio given to each car upon arrival, allowing passengers to tune in to the film at the flick of a switch.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Peter Johnston, said: We are extremely excited to host this Drive-In cinema in Ballymena and feel that it offers the perfect solution for an event when social distancing is required.“We have some great movies to show which will appeal to people of all ages and we know everyone will have a great time.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Events Calendar for coming months has been reshaped to reflect the ongoing public health guidelines around the prevention of the spread of Covid- – but there are plenty of things planned for our people to get involved with virtually.Tickets for the Drive-in cinema are limited and can be secured at both links belowhttps:www.eventbrite e drive-in-cinema-ballymena-tickets-https:www.eventbrite e drive-in-cinema-ballymena-tickets- "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3187815.jpg--.jpg?1592910110000\n","title":"deal in final stages for transfer of wrightbus land to people of ballymena","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and the former Wrightbus owners are finalising a deal for the transfer of  acres of land to the people of Ballymena.At a special meeting of Council on Monday night, Elected Members approved the sealing of the transfer of lands at the Lisnafillan site.Mayor Peter Johnston said: This is brilliant news for Ballymena and Mid and East Antrim as a whole.This site will play a vital role in our economic growth in the coming years and the timing of this announcement is even more signicant as we work to rebuild and recover our economy post-Covid.The proposed transformation of the lands into manufacturing space will be driven by the Council and we have already had strong interest from a number of major firms who would be keen to base their production here.These lands will be crucial in securing more jobs for our people and the growth of our advanced manufacturing sector in Mid and East Antrim.Councillor Gregg McKeen, who played a key role in discussions involving the transfer of the land as then Chair of the Borough Growth Committee, said: I commend the outstanding efforts and commitment of all those involved in this deal, which will protect and enhance our areas proud manufacturing legacy and heritage.While this process has taken longer than initially expected and has been hugely challenging due to a number of conditions placed on the deal, its great news we have negotiated to this position.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes  Press Eye.Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPrices in hairdressers, hotels, cafes and pubs are set to rise in post-lockdown Northern Ireland.Despite promises to keep them at pre-pandemic levels, key industry figures have warned customers of imminent hikes, to reflect increased costs and reduced capacity - and because they will struggle to offer deals across a range of services.Hairdressers said the price of a blow-dry, cut or colour was likely to rise by at least £ as salons offset extra costs.Belfast publican Willie Jack, owner of the famous Duke of York, the Harp Bar and The Dark Horse, said that punters can expect the price of a pint to rise to £, while Botanic Inns boss Stephen Magorrian warned that the cheapest wine on the menu could cost just under £ a bottle.Cafe owner Karen Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion in Londonderry, said cafes may have to raise their prices to offset all the new health and safety costs.And while none of the hoteliers contacted by the Belfastadmitted there would be price hikes, Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotel Federation indicated there are challenges ahead.There are additional costs for business: sanitation, new operational procedures and new equipment, she said.There are also issues around reduced capacity which brings into question the viability of some activities. Meanwhile, a number of income streams are effectively cut off as hotels are still unable to stage weddings and spas are restricted.Strict social distancing controls are likely to be reduced soon by the Executive from two metres to one, after Prime Minister Boris Johnston relaxed the rules in England earlier this week.It follows repeated calls from the hard hit hospitality, services and tourism sectors, as the roadmap to reopen the region gathers pace.Northern Ireland#s food-serving pubs, restaurants and hotels are gearing up to reopen on July , while hairdressers will have their scissors at the ready on July .Ken McClure, vice president of the Northern Ireland Hairdressers Association, said most salons would find price hikes unavoidable.Prices will have to go up by around £ per person to offset the additional costs we#ll incur to reopen safely, he told the Belfast .Owners will need to provide personal protection equipment , hand sanitisers, perspex screens and take other safety measures.Mr McClure, who owns Kenneth Michael International Hair and Beauty in east Belfast, said they would have to spread out appointments so that there will be fewer clients at any one time to comply with social distancing rules.There will be a very limited waiting area and we#ll be asking people to come alone, he added.We#ll also have to consider putting up extra pegs for clothes and wash gowns after every use.Colin Neil of Hospitality Ulster said it is hard to predict what effect increased costs and social distancing will have on pricing.He added: Pubs are looking at new business models and trying to work out how they break even.Mr Jack, a renowned publican, said the price of a pint will increase.I can see prices going up because of the cost of security required to keep numbers below a certain capacity, he said.The Duke of York and Harp Bar are both busy non-food, live music venues and I#ll have to operate at somewhere between % and % capacity.A pint might increase from £. to £. That#s also to avoid dealing with change. A glass of wine will probably stay the same price.Any publican who reopens will probably be losing money for the rest of the year.Mr Magorrian, whose bars include the hugely popular Northern Whig, said he was reviewing all prices both to reflect increased costs and for safety reasons.We need to move away from £. and £. and go to £. or £ to cut down on the level of change we#re carrying, he said.The cheapest bottle of wine in the Whig is £., whereas a glass is up by p to £. or £.He added: The major thing we#ll be doing is avoiding deals such as two courses for a set price mid-week, or kids eat free on a Sunday, or cocktail happy hour.Julie Hastings, marketing director at Hastings Hotels, whose portfolio includes The Europa and Grand Central in Belfast city centre, said prices will stay static.Prices at each of our seven properties are being kept very much the same as pre-lockdown to encourage as many bookings as possible, she said.Hospitality chief Michael Stewart, who co-runs House Belfast hotel, bar and restaurant, said it#s inevitable that a lot of venues will have to increase prices to sustain the costs they incur.He added: For hotels it#s a moving feast so nobody knows. If the Chancellor reduces VAT in the next budget it will give us room for manoeuvre on prices.

One, how sick levels among probationers is substantially lower - suggesting the stricter sick leave regime operated for probationers works, he told the Belfast .Two, the contrast with the private sector again suggests a dferent culture at play in the public sector.”Anxiety, stress, depression and other psychiatric illnesses accounted for the most absencesand, within this category, work-related stress accounting for around a third of the days lost.Looking at absences across each Stormont department, the Department of Justicehad the highest sickness absence rate with an average of . days lost, while the Executive Office had the least at . days.A DoJ spokesperson said: “The Department of Justice continues to take a proactive approach to the management of sickness absence including application of NI Civil Service policies and procedures such as written warnings, dismissals and ill health retirements where appropriate.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Hannah Richardson has grown up in Derry and is well-known in the local rock music scene as lead singer guitarist in three-piece rock band CHERYM. Her mother is a white Irish woman and father a black Sierra Leonean. Until now the -year-old has found the topic of racism dficult to address. But she felt duty-bound to speak out following the Black Lives Matter protests and subsequent stories in the Derry News. Nurse Beverly Simpson addressed the rally in Derry on June  then shared her family’s experience of racism in the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week, pharmacist Nkele Mushapho said she has been subjected to racism in the workplace with people requesting an ‘Irish pharmacist’ and constantly questioning her advice. Ms Richardson was ‘shocked’ that people commenting underneath those stories seemed unaware of racism in the city and were in some cases denying its existence. She has encountered racism since the age of  in nursery school and can’t understand the dismissive attitudes of some people. “There are a lot of people who are in denial about the fact that racism exists here,” she said. “I’ve lived here my whole le, it is a lovely place to live, the people here are fantastic. googletag.cmd.push “However, yes, there are a lot of racist people that live in Northern Ireland and Derry as well. “Racism is so common that I now have a tendency to just get on with it because you know it’s going to happen again the next time you go out. It becomes normal.” She was raised by a white mother and all her friends are predominantly white. Until now, she has never felt the need to make public her views. But the experience of Ms Mushapho struck a chord and she couldn’t believe people were disregarding her account. “I was reading those comments going, ‘seriously, you don’t know how bad it is’. I know that not all people from here are racist, or have anything against black people, but a lot of people are ignorant to the idea of racism. “A lot of people here find it acceptable to use racial slurs or casual racism because there’s never really been that many black people about to correct them or tell them otherwise - that ‘yes, that is offensive’.” COMPASSION Ms Richardson has natural afro hair which has attracted negative attention in the past: “I used to be fine with wearing it out, loud and proud and happy days, but recently every single time that I would wear my natural hair as opposed to having weaves or wearing a hat, somebody would say something about me. “Whether it be, ‘are you on your holidays or where are you from ’ “I was walking through Foyle Street recently when some boy came right up to me and screamed Mo Salah in my face. “It’s every weekend, every single day I leave the house with my hair like that I would say it happens. “It’s really, really tough. So, it is shocking to see people being so dismissive of other people’s experiences because I assumed everybody knew that it was like this but they clearly don’t.” The -year-old believes that now is the right time for everyone to have conversations about race. She was dismayed by comments underneath a post by former politician Pat Ramsey a number of years ago in which he shared a story of racist abuse directed at a group of black people visiting the city. On nights out people are ‘the worst’ because they see a group of black people and approach them, she said. At times it can be positive but on other occasions ‘slurs are thrown about’. Looking back, Ms Richardson ponders whether she should’ve engaged with people commenting under Pat Ramsey’s post. However, the most recent comments with people saying Ms Mushapho was ‘lying’, ‘Derry is not like that’, ‘Irish people have history of oppression and wouldn’t act in such a way’ couldn’t go unaddressed, Ms Richardson said. “Your own experience of oppression should not ever take away from the experiences of black people,anything it should make you more compassionate towards another minority suffering from racism. “Is it because people can’t relate to black struggle that they have to turn the oppression back on themselves. “We need to take a look at what’s going on under our noses.” PROGRESSIVE In her view, it is right to shine a spotlight on injustices everywhere but she believes it is wrong to overlook what is happening in the city by directing comments at Ms Mushapho such as ‘racism exists in South Africa too’. “That’s like saying, ‘your experience doesn’t matter to me, take a look at your own people’”, Ms Richardson added. She despises use of the word ‘coloured’ saying it is completely inappropriate when describing a black person. Experts on racism say it is regarded as a highly offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday le. In the US, because of the countrys era of racial segregation, it is among the most offensive words for describing a black person. Ms Richardson believes some people in Derry are intentionally racist but many others are completely unaware, they lack a basic understanding of what terms are racist. She explained: “A lot of us are ignorant on the subject, you might have made racist remarks in the past but you yourself might not be racist. “As long as you learn from that racist remark, take what you can from it and accept you may have offended someone then that’s a good progressive way to be.” Reflecting on the way forward, she concluded: “Does racism exist in Northern Ireland  Totally. “Does it exist in Derry  Aye. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions, to ask other black people “Stop disregarding people’s experiences of racism. “Let’s think about what can we do to make sure Derry is anti-racist, as opposed to just being against racism, what can we do to make this a better place ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. Business Lenders like Danske Bank in Northern Ireland have been working with the UK Government to provide vital financial support to companies experiencing lost or deferred revenue as a result of the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push They have appointed a dedicated head of business sector engagement to lead proactive engagement with businesses, raising awareness of the support available. Robert McCullough has taken on the important role. Speaking last month, he said: “Since the beginning of March, Danske Bank has provided poundmillion in overall business lending, including poundmillion through the UK government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and poundmillion on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.” The UK Government’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme grants finance of up to pound, to small and medium-sized businesses, interest-free for the first  months. Meanwhile, for companies with a turnover of up to poundmillion, the UK-wide Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme allows them to access up to poundmillion where the UK Government will pay interest and any fees for the first  months. googletag.cmd.push Danske Bank has also been able to provide relief of up to poundmillion to large businesses via the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. As the largest bank in Northern Ireland, Danske Bank supports companies in a wide iety of sectors, such as retailers Lunn’s Jewellers, manufacturers The Signature Works and in tourism, family-run bus company Airporter.  poundM LENDING: Danske Bank’s Robert McCullough Robert said: “Businesses in some industries have managed to adapt quickly to a new reality of remote working and social distancing, while others have regrettably seen trade grind to a halt. “The unprecedented measures announced by the government will help a lot of companies to survive and we are hopeful the majority will ultimately recover.” The bank was able to launch each of the Schemes on day one, the majority of applications being approved through an easy, automated process. “Getting this financial support in place in Northern Ireland was the result of a huge effort from teams across the Danske Bank and we continue to work hard to make sure the process is as good as it should be and that we can get money to our customers quickly. “There is no doubt that we have an important role to play in the weeks and months ahead to get Northern Ireland moving again. “We have the commitment and the capacity to continue to support customers, the community and the wider economy.”  FINDING A SOLUTION: Staff working at the Sunamp site in East Lothian When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh. The company has led the way in the manufacture of heat batteries that store heat energy rather than electricity like conventional batteries. The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency. In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with poundm of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.  The pound, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable. “Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.” The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest. “Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.” For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit. “There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said. “But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.” Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings. The types of support on offer to help your company… Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend Katie McAteer’s appointment to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of St Columb is one of two announced today by the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Reverend Andrew Forster. Reverend Robert Boyd, the Rector of Glendermott and Newbuildings Parish, has also been appointed a Canon.By happy coincidence, today - the Feast Day of St John the Baptist - is the anniversary of both new canons’ ordinations. Rev Boyd and Rev McAteer will fill the positions left vacant following the departure of the Ferry brothers – Rev Canon David, who has retired, and Rev Malcolm, who has become the Rector of Agherton Parish in Portstewart. googletag.cmd.push Rev McAteer, who is the Pastoral Director of the Christ Church, Culmore, Muff and St Peter’s Group of Parishes, said she was humbled and honoured by the appointment.“When Bishop Andrew first asked me, I was totally taken aback,” Rev McAteer said. “It was never on my radar, never in a million years – or even  years – would I have expected the Bishop to ask me to accept this appointment. “St Columb’s Cathedral, probably more than any other cathedral, has been a history-maker – the first cathedral built in these islands after the Reformationplaying a leading role as a place of reconciliation – and now another brick is being laid in its rich history. googletag.cmd.push “I still keep thinking, ‘No, not me. It can’t be me.’ It’s exciting. It’s quite daunting. I’m humbled and honoured.” Rev McAteer, whose father was a Canon of Chester Cathedral, evoked the words of the Ordination Service. “Throughout ministry, whatever God calls us to do, we pray that He will give us ‘the needful gts of grace’ to fulfil that ministry. I’m hoping that this is at God’s direction I can only do this in God’s strength.” While this isnew territory for Rev McAteer, the second new canon is on familiar ground. Rev Boyd, was a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh until three years ago, a position he relinquished when he was appointed incumbent of the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings. He has since taken up the role of Diocesan Director of Ordinands for Derry and Raphoe. “I feel very privileged and very honoured by the appointment,” Rev Boydsaid.  “I’m extremely grateful to Bishop Andrew for having the confidence in me to appoint me to this role and for thinking me worthy of it. I think it’s an honour, too, for the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings, so I’m very pleased that our parishioners are also being acknowledged and recognised by the Bishop.” The installation of a new canon is a signicant and joyful occasion for any cathedral but given its uniqueness, the forthcoming Service of Installation in St Columb’s – with its historical first – will arouse considerable interest within the Church of Ireland and beyond. A date has yet to be fixed for the Service but it is hoped it will take place in the early autumn. St Columb’s Cathedral, which was completed in , was the first Anglican cathedral built in the British Isles after the Reformation in .

Void Gallery is ‘delighted’ to announce artists Alan Phelan and David Beattie as the recipients of the Plinth Commissions for  and . The Walker Memorial Plinth was built in  - a  metre high column topped by a five metre high statue of the Reverend George Walker who was Governor of the city during the siege of Derry in . The column and statue were blown up by the IRA in . googletag.cmd.push The remaining plinth and its historical signicance have meant it has been a contentious space in the city. Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Plinth Commissions is a collaboration between Void Gallery, The Siege Museum and Friends of the Derry Walls. The ambition of the commission is to reclaim the space as a public area for collaboration and collective participation. Through an open call, artists both North and South of the border were invited to propose a project involving the community that surrounds the Plinth, creating sculptural interventions as part of the collaboration. The first commission by Dublin-based artist Alan Phelan will launch in September . googletag.cmd.push Phelan’s project is a crowd-sourced sculpture made by inidual participants in isolation, then assembled together to create the final artwork. This collective making process acknowledges and commemorates the COVID- crisis. The sculpture will be of a hyacinth flower using the red, green and blue colours with petals made in papier-macirccheacute, based around a small similar work due to be exhibited at Void Gallery as part of Phelan’s exhibition ‘echoes are always more muted’ which launches at the same time. Alan Phelan commented: “I am delighted to be part of the Plinth Commissions for . “My idea is to work with the community to mark this strange time we have all experienced and harness the people power of socially distanced activity to make this public sculpture. “I look forward to working with Void Engage and bringing people together by staying apart, as they say, for this project.” Launching in , David Beattie proposes a project that will unfold as an invitation to the community to collectively examine the River Foyle as an interconnecting body of water, a richness of bioersity, and a measure of perpetual time. Participants will be invited to connect with the river through a series of engagements that record their experiences and allow them to rethink their relationship with the river and their natural environments. The project will culminate in a sound recording that will be played from the Plinth and will mark the high and low tide of the river, bringing awareness of the rhythm of the river, and movement of time to people within the city. David Beattie, who is also from Dublin, said he was delighted to be selected for this unique commission. “It feels extra special to be supported to produce new artwork during a precarious time for artists and art workers. “I look forward to working alongside the team at Void and the communities on both sides of the River Foyle to realise the project for the Walker Plinth.” Void Director Mary Cremin added: “We are very excited about this public art programme that we have been developing in partnership with The Siege Museum and the Friends of the Derry Walls. “It is a signicant moment to have this plinth reclaimed as a public space when you consider how contentious public monuments and memorials are in this current moment in time,” added Ms Cremin.

St Marys Grammar School, Magherafelt, confirmed they intend to use the transfer test, known as the GL Entrance Assessment. In a statement, the school said they are aware of the unprecedented circumstances of this year. After y consideration of the issues, the Board of Governors of St Marys Grammar School intends to use academic selection in its admissions criteria for pupils wishing to transfer to the school in September , it read. The GL Entrance Assessment will be conducted in accordance with the most up-to-date Public Health Agency guidance available to schools at that time. googletag.cmd.push The school are part ofa group called the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium , who have taken measures to mitigate some of the disruption caused by Covid- this academic year. The group released a statement claiming marking and standardising approaches will ensure comparable outcomes to previous years. It will not, for example, be harder to achieve an A grade this year, it read. Every year, regardless of how many pupils sit the Entrance Assessment or of whether the papers prove to be slightly easier or more dficult than a previous year, the marking and standardisation processes ensure that similar proportions of pupils will achieve similar grades. googletag.cmd.push St Marys added that they have a contingency plan in the event of the Entrance Assessment not being able to take place. They said: Should it be required, the implementation of this plan will include alternative admission criteria, the details of which will be published for parents at that time. Any change of circumstances would have to be considered in the local context, acted upon and communicated to parents at the earliest possible date. St Columbs and Thornhill in Derry city are among a number of schools that have opted against asking prospective pupils to take the transfer test this year. Both are also members of the PPTC. Another County Derry member, Rainey Endowed in Magherafelt, are yet to publicly announce their arrangements, but astatement from the PPTC is available on their website, detailing information about transfer arrangements.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning. It confirms that a club member is not suffering from any Covid- Symptoms, been in close contact with anyone who is self-isolating or has travelled from another country in the past  days. PPE SUPPLEMENTARY KITS FOR CLUBS The IRFU will issue supplementary PPE Kits to clubs to assist in the implementation of their COVID- Club Health  Safety Plans.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning. It confirms that a club member is not suffering from any Covid- Symptoms, been in close contact with anyone who is self-isolating or has travelled from another country in the past  days. PPE SUPPLEMENTARY KITS FOR CLUBS The IRFU will issue supplementary PPE Kits to clubs to assist in the implementation of their COVID- Club Health  Safety Plans. Each club can expect to receive a PPE Kit to their designated COVID- Club Safety Officer contact from the week commencingth June.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work.

It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Despite the fact she admits she hated running, she decided to undertake a huge challenge when the lockdown started – km in  days.The -year-old wanted to do something to motivate herself, improve her emotional wellbeing and remind people that the service centre was still there for children even during the lockdown. Importantly, it would also raise much needed funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland’s Childhood Day.The service centre where Michelle works, is based at Carn Drive in Craigavon and delivers NSPCC’s Letting The Future In and Turn the Page services.Letting the Future In focuses on helping children and young people recover from the traumatic and negative effects of sexual abuse and to rebuild their lives, while Turn the Page helps children and young people overcome the experiences and feelings that have led tothem displaying harmful sexual behaviour towards others. Covid- has caused huge dficulties for the team in Craigavon because it is vital to maintain contact and the all-important relationship between the treatment workers and the young people but face-to-face contact wasn’t possible because of the lockdown. The centre has adapted to the situation by keeping in touch with appropriate apps and video calls which offer young people an opportunity to access support in their own environment but still maintain relationships with their workers.Michelle also has her own personal reasons for wanting to raise funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland.She said: “As a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I realise that the lockdown is a particularly dficult time because it can trigger traumas from the past such as the feelings of powerlessness, fear of threat to le and being ‘held captive’ by the virus through isolation and reduced connection to other people.“It can be hard to get motivated during such strange times so I decided to do something positive that would improve my overall emotional wellbeing whilst also raising money for NSPCC Northern Ireland and creating awareness of some of the work we do.“As a child I benefited from support from The NSPCC at a time when no one  believed in me and this has given me a real passion for the work I do now. It is so important that children who have been affected by child sexual abuse get all the help and support they need to help them recover and I can see that the staff at NSPCC still carry the same belief that children can and do survive the trauma of sexual abuse.”Michelle’s event has been a huge success.She said: “I have to admit, it has been tougher than I thought initially. As someone who hates running and has done very little, I think I underestimated it! However I have noticed a big improvement in my emotional wellbeing and sleep since beginning the challenge. I have definitely felt motivated by the support and all the generous donations and this has really spurred me on.“Above all, I just wanted to give something back to NSPCC as I believe I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support in the past. I also wanted to raise awareness about the taboo in our society surrounding sexual abuse and topromote our belief that children can and do recover with the right support.“Joanne McMaster, Supporter Fundraising Manager for Northern Ireland, added: “We are hugely grateful to Michelle for undertaking this wonderful fundraising initiative for NSPCC’s Childhood Day. “This is NSPCC Northern Ireland’s third Childhood Day and is taking place on June  and in the run up to the day, we are asking peopleto stand with us and support our work - there are lots of fun and simple ways toget involved. “This year, Childhood Day is encouraging the peopleto ‘Be a big kid’ and raise money to help us be here for children. This could include organising a childhood themed quiz night, getting sponsored to dress up for the day or holding a mini sports day in your back garden but in all cases, remembering to follow the latest social distancing rules. There are lots more ideas on how to get involved and suggestions for fun events on our website www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday“Funds raised by the day could not come at a better time because we are growing increasingly concerned about the number of children who will experience abuse or neglect due to the impact of coronavirus, with families struggling with lockdown, job losses and school closures. By supporting Childhood Day you are raising awareness and crucial funds to enable us to keep children and young people safe.”If you would like to contribute to Michelle’s fundraising, go to www.justgiving fundraising Michelle-Duffy For further information on how you can get support NSPCC’s Childhood Day, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or contact the NSPCC Northern Ireland Team at northernirelandappeals@nspcc.org.uk or   .--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

meeting by Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Kyle Savage and was seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.It read: “That this Council supports, where possible, our local producers and businesses within the procurement process of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council.“This will complement the current ‘SHOP LOCAL’ initiativesupported by Council and will provide much needed investment to the Council’s area.“We would ask that a report on this matter is brought forward urgently with a view to supporting our local economy.”Addressing the chamber, the Deputy Lord Mayor said as a local farmer he understands the important social and environmental responsibilitiescouncil has.“We as a Council have a responsibility to our producers and our local businesses in our Council area,” said the Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Kyle Savage.“I believe that we have a duty of care to our producers in ensuring that they get a fair share of the profit throughout the food chain.“We also need full

adopt the shop local initiativeand look at how Council’s procurement regulations can be adapted to help support local food producers and businesses.“Cost is always an issue but we as a Council have to take our environmental responsibilities into account,” said the Deputy Lord Mayor.“For example, this council is currently buying flowers from outside Northern Irelandbut we have a number of large nurseries within our own borough.“We should also bear in mind that that transport and energy costs are major contributesto green house gas emissions.“We need to look at the wording of framework for contracts and to be more proactive in encouraging local companies to apply for contracts.“As a farmer, I can see first hand the pressure that is facing our industry with the AgricultureBill andthe prospectof food imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone beef which are illegal to produce in Northern Ireland.”The motion was adopted by the Chamber and a report on the issues will be brought forward in due course.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\"
