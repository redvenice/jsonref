remaining 16 crew members are to stay onboard the vessel.Foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told Iranian state TV today that the crew members were being released under Iran\u0027s \u0027humane policy\u0027. \u0027We have no problem with the crew and the captain and the issue is violations that the vessel committed,\u0027 he said.  Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards seized the British tanker Stena Impero on July 19 after issuing a series of threats to UK shipping.          Some of the Stena\u0027s crew members are seen on board the ship days after it was captured          A close-up of the vessel shows top of the oil tanker, which was originally headed toward the Saudi Arabian city of Jubail, idling in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas in JulyIt sent Middle East tensions ratcheting up again in the wake of several mysterious explosions on Gulf ships and angry rhetoric over Iran\u0027s nuclear ambitions.President Hassan Rouhani warned the West that \u0027throughout history, Iran has been and will be the main guardian of security and free navigation\u0027 in the Gulf. Iran claimed the Stena had been seized for flouting maritime laws after supposedly hitting a fishing boat and switching off its distress signal. However, a spokesman for Iran\u0027s Guardian Council undermined that claim, saying that \u0027the rule of reciprocal action is well-known in international law\u0027. Gibralatar had seized the Grace 1 on July 4, claiming it was heading to Syria in violation of EU sanctions. Iran paraded the Stena\u0027s crew and Britain and America both beefed up their military presence in the Middle East in response to the shipping crisis. Experts have warned that a crisis in the critical Strait of Hormuz could endanger the world\u0027s oil supply. Gibraltar, which had seized the Grace 1 on July 4, allowed the tanker to leave after Tehran gave assurances that the oil would not be delivered to Syria.          On deck: The Stena is seen with an Iranian Revolutionary Guard boat beside it after it was captured in July         Iran\u0027s capture of the Stena was widely seen as retaliation for Britain\u0027s seizure of the Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 (pictured), now renamed the Adrian Darya 1U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month called Gibraltar\u0027s decision \u0027very unfortunate\u0027, in an implicit rebuke to Britain. \u0027If that ship again heads to Syria, we will take every action we can consistent with those sanctions to prevent that,\u0027 Pompeo warned. \u0027We have made clear that anyone who touches it, anyone who supports it, anyone who allows a ship to dock is at risk of receiving sanctions from the United States.\u0027 Washington wants the tanker detained because it says the vessel has links to Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards, which it has designated a terrorist organisation. Tehran said any U.S. move to seize the vessel again would have \u0027heavy consequences\u0027.  Tensions over Iran\u0027s nuclear ambitions have also been heightening as Tehran moves ever further away from its 2015 nuclear deal. After Donald Trump quit the nuclear deal in 2018, the U.S. administration reimposed tough sanctions on Iran, which retaliated by increasing its enrichment of uranium beyond limits set in the nuclear accord.  Trump called off air strikes against Iran at the last minute in June after the Islamic republic downed a U.S. drone.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Woodpecker returns tree trunk stash food owl asleep inside","story":"Share this article \u0027The woodpecker got within inches of the

It is particularly stressful when his behaviour stops you gaining access to the outside world and you feel trapped in your own home.\u0027Some of his behaviour has been disturbing and he has demonstrated an underlying obsession. It seems he holds an underlying and worrying hatred for us. Since we got the police and courts involved he has shown no contrition at all. We expect the outcome of this to remedy the situation and prevent further incidents in the future. And punish him for his offending over several months.\u0027         Mr Charnock (pictured leaving Manchester Magistrates\u0027 Court) suffered mouth ulcers due to stress over the harassmentComerford denied causing his neighbour harassment, but was convicted following a two-day trial.Prosecuting Anne Deakin said: \u0027This defendant pursued a course of harassment against his neighbours Mark Charnock and his partner Michelle Lynch. Over the last 18 months the defendant stopped them from accessing their home address by parking across a road they both share. This was the only way the victims could access their home.\u0027Both parties initially viewed it as a civil issue but matters eventually escalated and the police became involved. The defendant during this period deliberately blocked access to their home in a way that stopped them getting access to their home. He parked his vehicle in front of their gates in an attempt to upset them.\u0027It got to the point that the victims struggled to cope with the harassment. Both struggled to cope with every day life. The victim has had significant stomach pains. He was referred to a specialist and they thought it may be cancer but turns out it is an ulcer he feels is related to the stress caused by this.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Zoe Earl said: \u0027What instigated all this was an application permission. Mr Comerford suspected that the electric gates built by Mr Charnock may have been constructed illegally and the defendant feels he has the right of use of the whole driveway.\u0027Mr Comerford sought legal advice and through solicitors sent Mr Charnock a letter. This was not a criminal matter and should be dealt with by the civil courts. There have been various reports made by both parties to police.         Pictured: The drive in Salford that Comerford insisted on blocking in a parking \u0027war of attrition\u0027\u0027The prosecution\u0027s case is that this took place over an extended period but there are significant gaps in the behaviour. Six or seven months at a time where nothing is reported. Mr Comerford has has never been before the courts before and he will not be again. He is extremely ashamed this has happened. These matters have been reported in the press and his reputation has suffered a backlash.\u0027He is a businessman and this has had an impact on that in terms of his reputation. It has impacted him financially. He has had to pay for private counsel for a two day trial. In hindsight, reflecting upon his behaviour he has been able to concede the interpretation his neighbours had. The lesson has been learned.Comerford was also ordered to complete a 12 month community order, 120 hours unpaid work and pay £705 in costs and surcharges.He was also issued with an 18 month restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Charnock and his wife Michelle unless through a lawyer. The order stars he cannot cause obstruction and interfere in any way direct vehicular or pedestrian access to and from the Charnocks\u0027 address.At an earlier hearing Comerford accused Mr Charnock of waging a vendetta and said: \u0027We started building our forever home but he objected to three of the planning applications. First the double garage, then the change of fence, and then I wanted to raise the roof by one metre.\u0027He had previously knocked on my door and was aggressive, he was saying: Move your car, move your car. \u0027The first time I was aware of the harassment allegation was when the police turned up at my door.

Never in recent times is the money more needed.Not only is much of the public sector operating under severe constraints but the ghastly political stalemate over Brexit has cast a dark cloud over the economy.Growth moved into negative territory in the second quarter of the year. Business and consumer confidence is in free-fall. There is a mood of great uncertainty. World growth is stalling. And there is a serious danger of the country plunging into recession.The plummeting pound adds to the disruption, making British firms vulnerable to foreign predators who see us as the bargain basement of the world which can be raided at will.For example, pub chain Greene King has been bought by an Asian firm for £4.6million, aerospace pioneer Cobham is targeted by private equity bidders, while one of Britain\u0027s fastest growing creative firms, Entertainment One (home of Peppa Pig), is under siege from the US toy giant Hasbro.The saving grace in these disturbed times is the strength of the UK jobs market, with unemployment at just 3.8 per cent of the workforce. But there are the first indications that the job-creation machine is running out of steam.In the ten years since the financial crisis, the Treasury has relied on the Bank of England to drive output, investment, consumer spending and job creation by maintaining very low interest rates and by pumping extra cash into the financial system through its £435billion of quantitative easing (or printing extra money).         The Chancellor was chastised by Speaker John Bercow for rebuking Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Marxist spending plansWhile the Bank still has scope to cut the official interest rate (from the current 0.75 per cent), it is constrained by the collapse in the value of the pound on foreign exchange markets, which means imports cost more and inflation levels are pushed up.Separately, as cutting interest rates becomes less effective as a tool for driving economic expansion, it has been inevitable that Javid would have to ease budgetary rules and allow borrowing to take some of the strain. The fastest way for governments to deliver an economic boost is through tax cuts and these may come in November should the Johnson Government hang on to power.However, for the moment, ministers have decided to steal Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s thunder by throwing money at those public services which voters traditionally believe Labour cares for more, as well as protecting areas associated with Tory priorities such as the Armed Forces, the police and the courts.However, the major significance of Javid\u0027s change in fiscal direction merited better than to be delivered by a Chancellor, in his first substantive appearance at the dispatch box, in a soporific style. Javid made the wry wit and wisdom of his Eeyorish predecessor, the now-exiled Philip Hammond, look almost uproarious.Making lists of budgetary numbers and percentages is never easy but Javid was almost derailed when chastised by Speaker John Bercow for rebuking Corbyn\u0027s Marxist spending plans.Regardless of his lack of fireworks, we must treat Javid\u0027s statement yesterday as a down-payment for the future.It\u0027s a case of steady as she goes.Crucially, the extra expenditure will not jeopardise the current fiscal rules which seek to keep borrowing below 2 per cent of the total output of the economy and to keep debt (the accumulated borrowing over many years) being chipped away at.Fortunately, bigger than expected tax receipts along with the tight grip of public spending mean the Government has an estimated £15billion in reserve to spend without breaking any existing rules.Without doubt, as he spoke of a \u0027fiscal framework\u0027 that he proposes to announce in a post-Brexit November Budget, he signalled the current spending restrictions might be removed in order to keep the economy moving and to diminish the scale of the disruption and fiscal shock.Javid also recognised that one of the keys to future prosperity is to put new infrastructure in place, including much better rail and road systems for commuters as well as reinvigorating Britain\u0027s science-based economy.Of course, a recession would make all this very much more difficult as it would reduce the Treasury\u0027s take from taxes and raise the cost of payments such as unemployment benefits.The Chancellor is walking an economic tightrope but has taken a bold first step in the right direction.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Hurricane Dorian storms way East Coast hundreds seek refuge South Carolina shelters","story":"Share this articleShare this article‘Time is running out’ to escape Dorian, warns SC governor"},{"url":null,"title":"China says trade talks US place October","story":"Share this article Officials will \u0027conduct conscientious consultations\u0027 in mid-September to prepare, the Chinese ministry said.

Beijing responded by imposing duties of 10 per cent and 5 per cent on a range of American imports.US tariffs of 25 percent imposed previously on $250 billion of Chinese goods are due to rise to 30 per cent on October 1.China has imposed or announced penalties on a total of about $120 billion of U.S. imports, economists estimate. Some have been hit with increases more than once, while about $50 billion of US goods is unaffected, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries.Beijing also has retaliated by canceling purchases of soybeans, the biggest single US export to China.Beijing has agreed to narrow its politically sensitive trade surplus with the US but is reluctant to give up development strategies it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.Talks broke down in May over how to enforce any agreement.China insists Trump\u0027s punitive tariffs must be lifted once a deal takes effect. Washington says at least some must stay to make sure Beijing carries out any promises.The last round of talks in July in Shanghai ended with no indication of progress. Neither government has given any indication it is ready to break the deadlock by offering concessions.Some analysts suggest Beijing is holding out in hopes Trump will feel pressure to make a more favorable deal as his campaign for the 2020 presidential election picks up. Trump has warned that if he is re-elected, China will face a tougher US negotiating stance.Stock markets rose on Thursday\u0027s announcement but there has been no sign of progress since Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume deadlocked negotiations about trade and technology. "},{"url":null,"title":"Princess Charlotte arrives day school Thomass Battersea","story":"Share this articleFall for florals in a MICHAEL Michael Kors dress like the DuchessNow sold out!

I have covered the humanitarian consequences of war for three decades, but the sheer horror I witnessed during this conflict felt different.There was no end to the cruelty. The stream of suicide bombs, grenades, car bombs, and snipers was relentless. People were forced to watch their loved ones die in front of them. And when civilians did reach the point of escape, Isis would use them as human shields.But what really ripped at my heart was the plight of Isis children whose parents had been suicide bombers for the caliphate. I met one little girl called Khadija who was calling out for her mother, not realising that the burns all over her body were caused by her mother’s suicide bomb. As a mother, I will never understand an ideology that would induce you to hurt your own.The photo was taken near the ruins of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Isis first proclaimed the caliphate in 2014. It was like Armageddon: buildings were smoking, bombs were dropping and there was sniper fire from all angles. When people fled, they were first checked for suicide bombs by Iraqi soldiers, men had to remove their shirts, and their names were checked for recorded Isis affiliation. Then they moved on to the trauma stabilisation point for emergency medical care, which was where I spent most of my time taking photographs.This little girl had fled with a group of women and children. She paused here momentarily. My fixer had gone missing so I couldn’t speak to her but I knew I had to take the shot. It was the picture of innocence amid war, a tragic juxtaposition of this tiny girl who should have been enjoying her childhood trapped in the middle of this catastrophic battle. She only stayed briefly. She looked to me as though she was in shock and she rejoined the group of women and children only a few moments later. This piece of rubble was the only place she could rest.I wanted my work in Mosul to help viewers to see these people as iniduals. It’s really hard when you talk about war and statistics and the numbers dying to remember the humanity behind the numbers. But when you focus on inidual faces, or a little girl sitting in debris with her head in her hands, it touches people on a universal emotional level, and gives viewers the possibility to connect. That’s always been my goal.Isis may have been defeated, but the ideology has not been eradicated. Some of the children I met already knew the meaning of martyrdom because their parents indoctrinated them from birth. I don’t know what happens to those kids.Hope is something I always look for, even within the worst devastation and despair. I didn’t see much of it in Mosul. Perhaps the closest thing came from the medics. They saved countless lives, and I know they were frustrated – the Iraqi government would not let them any nearer to the frontline, so they were forced to watch people die who they probably could have saved had they had just a couple more minutes. To me, they were angels amid the misery.Photojournalism is never about us, we’re just the link to the narratives of others. You have to feel something when you see things like this, but empathy can be as much of a curse as it is a blessing. I have always tried to be open about the trauma I’ve experienced, the PTSD, the meltdowns, but I think the thing that saves my sanity is my understanding that what I have experienced is nothing compared with what the people in my pictures have lived through.Training: Associate’s degree in applied science for photography, Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale.High point: “When I was asked to be godmother to a girl I had photographed during the Sierra Leone civil war.”Low point: “Losing my mother, sister and dearest friend, then losing my job at the Washington Post.

Already I am petrified.This statue was a small token of appreciation for my many contributions, said the citation, which was read out by Aunt Vidala. She’d been assigned the task by our superiors, and was far from appreciative. I thanked her with as much modesty as I could summon, then pulled the rope that released the cloth drape shrouding me it billowed to the ground, and there I stood. We don’t do cheering here at Ardua Hall, but there was some discreet clapping. I inclined my head in a nod.My statue is larger than life, as statues tend to be, and shows me as younger, slimmer, and in better shape than I’ve been for some time. I am standing straight, shoulders back, my lips curved into a firm but benevolent smile. My eyes are fixed on some cosmic point of reference understood to represent my idealism, my unflinching commitment to duty, my determination to move forward despite all obstacles. Not that anything in the sky would be visible to my statue, placed as it is in a morose cluster of trees and shrubs beside the footpath running in front of Ardua Hall. We Aunts must not be too presumptuous, even in stone.Clutching my left hand is a girl of seven or eight, gazing up at me with trusting eyes. My right hand rests on the head of a woman crouched at my side, her hair veiled, her eyes upturned in an expression that could be read as either craven or grateful – one of our Handmaids – and behind me is one of my Pearl Girls, ready to set out on her missionary work. Hanging from a belt around my waist is my Taser. This weapon reminds me of my failings: had I been more effective, I would not have needed such an implement. The persuasion in my voice would have been enough.As a group of statuary it’s not a great success: too crowded. I would have preferred more emphasis on myself. But at least I look sane. It could well have been otherwise, as the elderly sculptress – a true believer since deceased – had a tendency to confer bulging eyes on her subjects as a sign of their pious fervour. Her bust of Aunt Helena looks rabid, that of Aunt Vidala is hyperthyroid, and that of Aunt Elizabeth appears ready to explode.At the unveiling the sculptress was nervous. Was her rendition of me sufficiently flattering? Did I approve of it? Would I be seen to approve? I toyed with the idea of frowning as the sheet came off, but thought better of it: I am not without compassion. “Very lifelike,” I said.That was nine years ago. Since then my statue has weathered: pigeons have decorated me, moss has sprouted in my damper crevices. Votaries have taken to leaving offerings at my feet: eggs for fertility, oranges to suggest the fullness of pregnancy, croissants to reference the moon. I ignore the breadstuffs – usually they have been rained on – but pocket the oranges. Oranges are so refreshing.I write these words in my private sanctum within the library of Ardua Hall – one of the few libraries remaining after the enthusiastic book-burnings that have been going on across our land. The corrupt and blood-smeared fingerprints of the past must be wiped away to create a clean space for the morally pure generation that is surely about to arrive. Such is the theory.But among these bloody fingerprints are those made by ourselves, and these can’t be wiped away so easily. Over the years I’ve buried a lot of bones now I’m inclined to dig them up again – if only for your edification, my unknown reader. If you are reading, this manuscript at least will have survived. Though perhaps I’m fantasizing: perhaps I will never have a reader. Perhaps I’ll only be talking to the wall, in more ways than one.That’s enough inscribing for today. My hand hurts, my back aches, and my nightly cup of hot milk awaits me. I’ll stash this screed in its hiding place, avoiding the surveillance cameras – I know where they are, having placed them myself. Despite such precautions, I’m aware of the risk I’m running: writing can be dangerous. What betrayals, and then what denunciations, might lie in store for me? There are several within Ardua Hall who would love to get their hands on these pages.Wait, I counsel them silently: it will get worse.You have asked me to tell you what it was like for me when I was growing up within Gilead. You say it will be helpful, and I do wish to be helpful. I imagine you expect nothing but horrors, but the reality is that many children were loved and cherished, in Gilead as elsewhere, and many adults were kind though fallible, in Gilead as elsewhere.I hope you will remember, too, that we all have some nostalgia for whatever kindness we have known as children, however bizarre the conditions of that childhood may seem to others. I agree with you that Gilead ought to fade away – there is too much of wrong in it, too much that is false, and too much that is surely contrary to what God intended – but you must permit me some space to mourn the good that will be lost.At our school, pink was for spring and summer, plum was for fall and winter, white was for special days: Sundays and celebrations. Arms covered, hair covered, skirts down to the knee before you were five and no more than two inches above the ankle after that, because the urges of men were terrible things and those urges needed to be curbed. The man eyes that were always roaming here and there like the eyes of tigers, those searchlight eyes, needed to be shielded from the alluring and indeed blinding power of us – of our shapely or skinny or fat legs, of our graceful or knobbly or sausage arms, of our peachy or blotchy skins, of our entwining curls of shining hair or our coarse unruly pelts or our straw-like wispy braids, it did not matter. Whatever our shapes and features, we were snares and enticements despite ourselves, we were the innocent and blameless causes that through our very nature could make men drunk with lust, so that they’d stagger and lurch and topple over the verge – The verge of what? we wondered. Was it like a cliff ? – and go plunging down in flames, like snowballs made of burning sulphur hurled by the angry hand of God. We were custodians of an invaluable treasure that existed, unseen, inside us we were precious flowers that had to be kept safely inside glass houses, or else we would be ambushed and our petals would be torn off and our treasure would be stolen and we would be ripped apart and trampled by the ravenous men who might lurk around any corner, out there in the wide sharp-edged sin-ridden world.That was the kind of thing runny-nosed Aunt Vidala would tell us at school while we were doing petit-point embroidery for handkerchiefs and footstools and framed pictures: flowers in a vase, fruit in a bowl were the favoured patterns. But Aunt Estée, the teacher we liked the best, would say Aunt Vidala was overdoing it and there was no point in frightening us out of our wits, since to instil such an aversion might have a negative influence on the happiness of our future married lives.“All men are not like that, girls,” she would say soothingly. “The better kind have superior characters. Some of them have decent self-restraint. And once you are married it will seem quite different to you, and not very fearsome at all.” Not that she would know anything about it, since the Aunts were not married they were not allowed to be. That was why they could have writing and books. “We and your fathers and mothers will choose your husbands wisely for you when the time comes,” Aunt Estée would say. “So you don’t need to be afraid. Just learn your lessons and trust your elders to do what is best, and everything will unfold as it should. I will pray for it.”But despite Aunt Estée’s dimples and friendly smile, it was Aunt Vidala’s version that prevailed. It turned up in my nightmares: the shattering of the glass house, then the rending and tearing and the trampling of hooves, with pink and white and plum fragments of myself scattered over the ground. I dreaded the thought of growing older – older enough for a wedding. I had no faith in the wise choices of the Aunts: I feared that I would end up married to a goat on fire.The pink, the white, and the plum dresses were the rule for special girls like us. Ordinary girls from Econofamilies wore the same thing all the time –those ugly multicoloured stripes and grey cloaks, like the clothes of their mothers. They did not even learn petit-point embroidery or crochet work, just plain sewing and the making of paper flowers and other such chores. They were not pre-chosen to be married to the very best men – to the Sons of Jacob and the other Commanders or their sons – not like us although they might get to be chosen once they were older if they were pretty enough.Nobody said that. You were not supposed to preen yourself on your good looks, it was not modest, or take any notice of the good looks of other people. Though we girls knew the truth: that it was better to be pretty than ugly. Even the Aunts paid more attention to the pretty ones. But if you were already pre-chosen, pretty didn’t matter so much.I didn’t have a squint like Huldah or a pinchy built-in frown like Shunammite, and I didn’t have barely-there eyebrows like Becka, but I was unfinished. I had a dough face, like the cookies my favourite Martha, Zilla, made for me as a treat, with raisin eyes and pumpkin-seed teeth. But though I was not especially pretty, I was very, very chosen. Doubly chosen: not only pre-chosen to marry a Commander but chosen in the first place by Tabitha, who was my mother.That is what Tabitha used to tell me: “I went for a walk in the forest,” she would say, “and then I came to an enchanted castle, and there were a lot of little girls locked inside, and none of them had any mothers, and they were under the spell of the wicked witches. I had a magic ring that unlocked the castle, but I could only rescue one little girl. So I looked at them all very carefully, and then, out of the whole crowd, I chose you!”“What happened to the others?” I would ask. “The other little girls?”“Different mothers rescued them,” she would say.“Did they have magic rings too?”“Of course, my darling. In order to be a mother, you need to have a magic ring.”“Where’s the magic ring?” I would ask. “Where is it now?”“It’s right here on my finger,” she would say, indicating the third finger of her left hand. The heart finger, she said it was. “But my ring had only one wish in it, and I used that one up on you. So now it’s an ordinary, everyday mother ring.”At this point I was allowed to try on the ring, which was gold, with three diamonds in it: a big one, and a smaller one on either side. It did look as if it might have been magic once.“Did you lift me up and carry me?” I would ask. “Out of the forest?” I knew the story off by heart, but I liked to hear it repeated.“No, my dearest, you were already too big for that. If I had carried you I would have coughed, and then the witches would have heard us.” I could see this was true: she did cough quite a lot. “So I took you by the hand, and we crept out of the castle so the witches wouldn’t hear us. We both said Shh, shh” – here she would hold her finger up to her lips, and I would hold my finger up too and say Shh, shh delightedly – “and then we had to run very fast through the forest, to get away from the wicked witches, because one of them had seen us going out the door. We ran, and then we hid in a hollow tree. It was very dangerous!”I did have a hazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand. Had I hidden in a hollow tree? It seemed to me that I had hidden somewhere. So maybe it was true.“And then what happened?” I would ask.“And then I brought you to this beautiful house. Aren’t you happy here? You are so cherished, by all of us! Aren’t we both lucky that I chose you?”I would be nestled close to her, with her arm around me and my head against her thin body, through which I could feel her bumpy ribs. My ear would be pressed to her chest, and I could hear her heart hammering away inside her – faster and faster, it seemed to me, as she waited for me to say something. I knew my answer had power: I could make her smile, or not.What could I say but yes and yes? Yes, I was happy. Yes, I was lucky. Anyway it was true.They say I will always have the scar, but I’m almost better so yes, I think I’m strong enough to do this now. You’ve said that you’d like me to tell you how I got involved in this whole story, so I’ll try though it’s hard to know where to begin.I’ll start just before my birthday, or what I used to believe was my birthday. Neil and Melanie lied to me about that: they’d done it for the best of reasons and they’d meant really well, but when I first found out about it I was very angry at them. Keeping up my anger was difficult, though, because by that time they were dead. You can be angry at dead people, but you can never have a conversation about what they did or you can only have one side of it. And I felt guilty as well as angry, because they’d been murdered, and I believed then that their murder was my fault.I was supposed to be turning sixteen. What I was most looking forward to was getting my driver’s licence. I felt too old for a birthday party, though Melanie always got me a cake and ice cream and sang “Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true,” an old song I’d loved as a child and was now finding embarrassing. I did get the cake, later – chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, my favourites – but by then I couldn’t eat it. By that time Melanie was no longer there.That birthday was the day I discovered that I was a fraud. Or not a fraud, like a bad magician: a fake, like a fake antique. I was a forgery, done on purpose. I was so young at that moment – just a split second ago, it seems –but I’m not young anymore. How little time it takes to change a face: carve it like wood, harden it. No more of that wide-eyed daydream gazing I used to do. I’ve become sharper, more focused. I’ve become narrowed.Neil and Melanie were my parents they ran a store called The Clothes Hound. It was basically used clothing: Melanie called it “previously loved” because she said “used” meant “exploited.” The sign outside showed a smiling pink poodle in a fluffy skirt with a pink bow on its head, carrying a shopping bag. Underneath was a slogan in italics and quotation marks: “You’d Never Know!” That meant the used clothes were so good you’d never know they were used, but that wasn’t true at all because most of the clothes were crappy.Melanie said she’d inherited The Clothes Hound from her grandmother. She also said she knew the sign was old-fashioned, but people were familiar with it and it would be disrespectful to change it now.Our store was on Queen West, in a stretch of blocks that had once all been like that, said Melanie – textiles, buttons and trims, cheap linens, dollar stores. But now it was going upmarket: cafés with fair trade and organic were moving in, big-brand outlets, name boutiques. In response, Melanie hung a sign in the window: Wearable Art. But inside, the store was crowded with all kinds of clothes you would never call wearable art. There was one corner that was kind of designer, though anything really pricey wouldn’t be in The Clothes Hound in the first place. The rest was just everything. And all sorts of people came and went: young, old, looking for bargains or finds, or just looking. Or selling: even street people would try to get a few dollars for T-shirts they’d picked up at garage sales.Melanie worked on the main floor. She wore bright colours, like orange and hot pink, because she said they created a positive and energetic atmosphere, and anyway she was part gypsy at heart. She was always brisk and smiling, though on the lookout for shoplifting. After closing, she sorted and packed: this for charity, this for rags, this for Wearable Art. While doing the sorting she’d sing tunes from musicals – old ones from long ago. “Oh what a beautiful morning” was one of her favourites, and “When you walk through a storm.” I would get irritated by her singing I’m sorry about that now.Sometimes she’d get overwhelmed: there was too much fabric, it was like the ocean, waves of cloth coming in and threatening to drown her. Cashmere! Who was going to buy thirty-year-old cashmere? It didn’t improve with age, she would say – not like her.Neil had a beard that was going grey and wasn’t always trimmed, and he didn’t have much hair. He didn’t look like a businessman, but he handled what they called “the money end”: the invoices, the accounting, the taxes. He had his office on the second floor, up a flight of rubber-treaded stairs. He had a computer and a filing cabinet and a safe, but otherwise that room wasn’t much like an office: it was just as crowded and cluttered as the store because Neil liked to collect things. Wind-up music boxes, he had a number of those. Clocks, a lot of different clocks. Old adding machines that worked with a handle. Plastic toys that walked or hopped across the floor, such as bears and frogs and sets of false teeth. A slide projector for the kind of coloured slides that nobody had anymore. Cameras – he liked ancient cameras. Some of them could take better pictures than anything nowadays, he’d say. He had one whole shelf with nothing on it but cameras.One time he left the safe open and I looked inside. Instead of the wads of money I’d been expecting, there was nothing in it but a tiny metal-and-glass thing that I thought must be another toy, like the hopping false teeth. But I couldn’t see where to wind it up, and I was afraid to touch it because it was old.“Can I play with it?” I asked Neil.“Play with what?”“That toy in the safe.”“Not today,” he said, smiling. “Maybe when you’re older.” Then he shut the safe door, and I forgot about the strange little toy until it was time for me to remember it, and to understand what it was.Neil would try to repair the various items, though often he failed because he couldn’t find the parts. Then the things would just sit there, “collecting dust,” said Melanie. Neil hated throwing anything out.On the walls he had some old posters: LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS, from a long-ago war a woman in overalls flexing her biceps to show that women could make bombs – that was from the same olden-days war and a red-and-black one showing a man and a flag that Neil said was from Russia before it was Russia. Those had belonged to his great-grandfather, who’d lived in Winnipeg. I knew nothing about Winnipeg except that it was cold.I loved The Clothes Hound when I was little: it was like a cave full of treasures. I wasn’t supposed to be in Neil’s office by myself because I might “touch things,” and then I might break them. But I could play with the wind-up toys and the music boxes and the adding machines, under supervision. Not the cameras though, because they were too valuable, said Neil, and anyway there was no film in them, so what would be the point?We didn’t live over the store. Our house was a long distance away, in one of those residential neighbourhoods where there were some old bungalows and also some newer, bigger houses that had been built where the bungalows had been torn down. Our house was not a bungalow – it had a second floor, where the bedrooms were – but it was not a new house either. It was made of yellow brick, and it was very ordinary. There was nothing about it that would make you look at it twice. Thinking back, I’m guessing that was their idea.• © Margaret Atwood 2019.

Warner Brothers bought the rights to her first, bestselling, novel, The Secret History, in 1992, the year of its publication. With its cast of beautiful young obsessives drawn to murderous violence it begged to be filmed. Yet it never happened Alan Pakula, who was to have directed it, died in 1998. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and her brother acquired the rights, but also failed to make the movie. (The rights have duly reverted to the novelist herself.)Now, however, Tartt’s third novel, The Goldfinch (2013), has been made into a film. Directed by John Crowley, who was responsible for the adaptation of Colm Tóibín’s dauntingly inward novel Brooklyn, it stars Oakes Fegley and Ansel Elgort as Tartt’s protagonist and narrator, Theo Decker, at different stages of his life. (One big challenge to the film-maker is the eight-year jump halfway through the novel, which takes Theo from his early teens to his 20s.) Aged 13, the only child of a single mother, Theo is cast adrift when she is killed in a bomb explosion at a New York art gallery. He survives, and in the chaos purloins a painting that his mother loved and with which he becomes obsessed. Nicole Kidman features as Mrs Barbour, the mother of his schoolfriend Andy, who initially appears to adopt Theo. Luke Wilson plays his feckless, self-deluding father, who reappears to take him off to a strange new life in Las Vegas.While The Goldfinch was a bestseller and won the Pulitzer prize for fiction, it ided critics. One challenge to film-makers is its length (864 pages in the current paperback edition well over 300,000 words). It was called “Dickensian” by some admiring reviewers, but the largest Dickens novels rely on highly elaborate plotting and a large cast of characters. The Goldfinch offers neither of these.The reason it is so long is that, like Tartt’s two previous novels, it is thick with circumstantial detail. Tartt cannot narrate even the least significant episode without fully visualising it. Tartt’s novelistic modus operandi is, indeed, cinematic. Often the density of detail is such that the sentences become verbless lists. Tartt’s narrator catalogues the world’s visual clutter as greedily as any unblinking movie camera. The descriptions of the Balfours’ huge Park Avenue apartment, with all its dark wood and chinoiserie, or the new-build Las Vegas house at the edge of the desert, where Theo has to live with his father, are like instruction sheets for set builders. When Theo is taken to a violent criminal’s New York lair, you might expect him to be nervous, but he is too busy noticing the pictures on the wall and the books (Nabokov’s Despair, Heidegger’s Being and Time) on the table.Tartt’s invents a narrator who is as obsessed with detail as she is (never has there been a teenage boy with such an eye for furnishings). Theo becomes attached to Hobie, a furniture restorer, and learns his methods, which are duly taught to the reader. He becomes a lover of antique artifacts. And it is not just things. We spend some 150 pages in Las Vegas, where at his new high school Theo befriends Boris, the pithily cynical son of a very dodgy Ukrainian mining speculator, with whom he is soon taking implausibly huge amounts of drugs. The high-school subcultures are precisely specified. Every good and bad drug trip is described with excruciating exactitude.Boris is the novel’s most vivid character. Tartt fashions an idiolect for him that is a gift to any writer of a screenplay. She has a gift for rendering the unspoken scorn of the teenager for adult self-delusions, audible in the voice of Theo’s rich yet put-upon friend Andy. One of the best things in the book is the group portrait of Andy’s family, the absurdly privileged Balfours, in their grand apartment on Park Avenue. The covertly manic Mr Balfour, a little too enthusiastic about anything nautical. The perfect-seeming Mrs Balfour, dedicated to decorous charity and unperturbing high culture. Their eldest son, the hilariously seedy and baleful Platt, home from his super-exclusive boarding school because of some always unspecified sin. Tartt loves her East Coast élite types, here offering character actors some deliciously, maliciously observed variants. The Barbours’ mannered, sardonic repartee is one of the pleasures of the book that should successfully transfer to film.Many of these characters take on the author’s specifying habits. When the brutish Platt tells Theo about his father’s tragic sailing accident, it is with a psychologically unlikely but narratively gripping precision. The gift for minutiae controls the novel’s setpiece scenes, whose re-creation any director should relish. Each of Tartt’s novels turns on an episode of shocking violence. Here we begin with the bomb explosion and its immediate aftermath, described with full, second-by-second immersion in the dizzying detail. Near the end of the novel, there is an entirely unexpected and chaotic shoot-out. This must, in fact, take only seconds, but is narrated in a characteristic Tartt slow motion that appears already cinematic. As Theo recounts sudden movements he talks of events “like a skip in a DVD throwing me forward in time”.The hard part will be the obsession that drives the plot. Theo steals The Goldfinch. It is a real painting: a small masterpiece of the Dutch golden age by Carel Fabritius, a brilliant pupil of Rembrandt. It hangs in the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague. Fabritius died young, killed when the gunpowder magazine in the town of Delft exploded, destroying his studio (and many of his paintings). He left a tantalisingly small oeuvre, including this small, gorgeous painting of a bird, which, on close observation, is tethered by a small chain to its perch. In the novel, it is possible for the author to make us share the narrator’s passion for the modest work of art. The film will have to show the picture to us and make us understand its magnetism.The story of Fabritius’s death must have been the germ for Tartt’s novel. When Theo thinks of the artist he dwells on “the element of chance: random disasters, mine and his, converging on the same unseen point”. Such chance leads him to fall for a red-headed girl whom he spots in the art gallery just before the explosion and then continues to encounter over the years that follow. She is his other obsession – but has almost nothing to say or do in the book. Here is the weakest aspect of the novel and the biggest test for the film-makers. They will surely want to fill out her character and Theo’s devotion to her will they be able to resist the sentimentality that Tartt resolutely avoids? I would bet not.• The Goldfinch is released on 27 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/260fdef778328943cb5f1aeefd4f3ae70dbbaca5/0_57_5438_3263/master/5438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=049013021807d777ab96e34f2cb7046b","title":"when men are afraid to interact with women at work it harms the whole company","story":"Hindering a female employee’s advancement out of fears of your own behavior is impeding the growth of your organizationThere’s no arguing that the #MeToo movement has helped many women in the workplace. Unfortunately, no less than three studies have recently shown that the efforts to ultimately eliminate gender discrimination and harassment are having negative effects for some women in the office as well. But there is another casualty here too, as the men who have failed to learn the lessons #MeToo have taught us.Earlier this year, Sheryl Sandberg’s organization LeanIn published the results of its study of 5,000 US adults, which examined the #MeToo movement’s impact on the workplace, and the news wasn’t encouraging either.Citing the study’s authors who conclude that “most men know what sexual harassment is, and most women know what it is”, Mahdawi is clear about who’s to blame. “So there you go: most men are perfectly aware of the difference between a friendly hug and a creepy hug,” she writes. “They are perfectly aware of what constitutes harassment and what doesn’t. Which makes you wonder why so many men are afraid to interact with women at work?”As a middle-aged man, business owner and manager, I must admit that Mahdawi is right.What’s missing from these studies is another casualty of this behavior: the business owner or manager. That’s the moron who doesn’t hire or promote a talented employee just because a working relationship with her would require “close interaction”.If you’re that guy, then hindering a female employee’s advancement out of fears of your own behavior is impeding the growth of your own company – and the welfare of your other employees.

The currency’s bounce comes after a negative start to the week when the risks of the UK leaving the EU with no deal rose as high as 40 per cent, based on prices in the options market.UBS Wealth Management predict sterling could surge back to $1.30 if Brexit is delayed beyond October.Their chief economist, Dean Turner, told clients that the ‘Benn bill’ blocking a no-deal Brexit is likely to be approved soon. saying:Sterling has been buffeted by the frenetic pace of events in Parliament over the last couple of days. Removing the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit has helped the pound recover some of its recent weakness.If, as we expect, Brexit is delayed until January 2020 and an election is held after October, we would expect this recovery to continue. A Brexit delay would push the pound over $1.30, he suspects, a level last seen in May.And if Britain left the EU with a deal, the pound could strengthen to $1.35, which would be a 16-month high.UBS also expects an election soon, even though the Labour Party refused to trigger one last night.We have long been of the view that the UK faces an election at some point before the final decision on Brexit is made. We stick to this view now.When the election does come, it is only then that will we have greater clarity on how the Brexit saga will end.Sterling has been moving inversely to Boris Johnson’s authority this week.It fell on Monday as government sources revealed the PM was planning an election on October 14, hitting a three-year low below $1.20 on Tuesday morning. But it then began to recover sharply, as the government dramatically lost its majority on Tuesday afternoon (when Phillip Lee joined the Liberal Democrats). It kept rallying as MPs voted to debate legislation to block No Deal.Sterling picked up the pace on Wednesday as MPs backed this bill, and failed to give Johnson the two-thirds majority needed for a snap election.This morning has seen fresh gains, as pressure continues to mount on the government.The pound has also rallied against the euro, to a one-month high.Sterling is trading at €1.117, its highest level since 26 July (a few days after Boris Johnson won the Conservative leadership battle)Some City investors are confident that Brexit will delayed until next year.The pound is rallying after Parliament tore up U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy and denied his request for a snap election, tempering fears of further political turmoil, reports Bloomberg.“My expectation is Brexit is delayed until Jan. 31 with an election after the initial deadline and before the end of January,” said Neil Jones, head of currency sales for financial institutions at Mizuho Bank Ltd.“A delay for both Brexit and a general election will continue to send the pound higher.”The pound hit its highest level in five weeks after Boris Johnson’s own brother announced he is stepping down as a minister and an MP.In a jaw-dropping tweet, Jo Johnson says he has been wrestling with the tension between family loyalty and the national interest!Andy Sparrow’s Politics Live blog has all the action on another astonishing day:The pound is moving inversely to Boris Johnson’s grip on power.The weaker his government looks, the strong sterling becomes.Fiona Cincotta of City Index says:It is all about politics in the markets at the moment.

It had not reckoned with its residentsPhotography by Jesco DenzelNever schedule a demolition in St Jacques for the afternoon. Nothing much stirs in the morning in this mainly Gypsy neighbourhood of Perpignan, south-west France, but by 4pm on 27 July last year, when the diggers turned up at Place du Puig, the locals were up – and full of fire.Sixty of them, furious at what they saw as mystifying recent demolitions in other parts of the neighbourhood, and worried about a conspiracy to force the Gypsy community out of the heart of Perpignan, refused to let the workman pull another lever.Their leader was Alain Gimenez, 54, a former St Jacques bad boy with two nicknames. The first, Nounours (“Teddy Bear”), nods to his cuddly frame, but his fierce and deep-tanned face exudes the charismatic vehemence that fits his second, harder moniker: Lino.“We’ve told the supervisor that if they don’t stop, things are going to get nasty,” Gimenez said.Then, in November 2018, two buildings collapsed in the Noailles district of nearby Marseille, killing eight people and provoking international horror at poor housing conditions in major French cities. The Marseille disaster underlined the urgency in Perpignan, and the city pressed ahead with its plan to demolish 483 buildings in St Jacques by 2024, and build 240 new ones.It did not, it seems, reckon with the Gypsies.The assistant mayor Olivier Amiel, who until recently was in charge of the regeneration, calls them “the soul of Perpignan”. The medieval street grid of St Jacques is the Gypsies’ raucous enclave, where they make up roughly three-quarters of a population somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000, depending on who you ask: the census can’t accurately assess the neighbourhood.It is not till late afternoon that the streets of St Jacques come to life, shuttered premises opening up to reveal bars and corner shops, overspilling with chatter in the local dialect of gitan (a form of Catalan mixed with the Romani language caló). “It’s another universe up there,” a lifelong Perpignan resident tells me. “You have to switch off that western, inidualistic, orderly part of your brain.”Place du Puig, a lively square at the top of a hill, is the heart of the neighbourhood. The bulldozers were trained specifically on Ilot Puig (“the Puig block”), a clump of nine buildings that was already earmarked for the wrecking ball after the collapse of a social centre here in 2006, in which one person died and 13 children barely escaped.The locals had other ideas. They didn’t like the vagueness of the city’s regeneration plans – the fuzzy timelines, the lack of information about prospective rents, and above all the total lack of construction to date on 50 other buildings in St Jacques that had already been bulldozed. Was all the urbanism talk emanating from city hall of greater mixité (social mix) and “de-densification” really just a euphemism for de-Gypsification?Rooted in paranoia or not, the anger led to an unlikely coalition. Gypsy representatives teamed up with counterparts in the neighbourhood’s north African population, with whom there had previously been little love lost after a violent confrontation between members of the two communities in 2005. They were also joined by an assortment of local middle-class groups who are keen to preserve St Jacques’ ragtag architectural heritage and carnival atmosphere: the city is bidding for Unesco world heritage classification, a process that could not be seen to sideline the city’s Gypsies.So when the protesters blocked the bulldozers and barricaded the building site, the wider coalition quickly rallied in support. Spooked by the growing numbers, and by the prospect of full-blown riots, the city’s prefect froze demolition.Something significant had happened. For the first time, the normally apolitical, insular Gypsies had successfully campaigned and cooperated with outside groups. St Jacques was awake.The thing outsiders tend to focus on in St Jacques is the rubbish. It lines the gutters: broken bottles, ringpulls, chocolate-bar wrappers, plaster shards. But the neighbourhood overflows in other ways too. Laundry hangs off the balconies, rumba music courses out of the occasional top window. Names – Bombom, Peto, Elisabeth, Anais – are scrawled in permanent marker on doors and walls, giving them a veneer of love and friendship mementoes. Women pushing buggies look almost like orthodox Jews in full-length black shirts, except for the cardigans covered in sequinned slogans. Four-year-olds zip past on motorised minibikes. A cool-looking guy with a guitar says hello: a member of Perpignan Gypsy supergroup Tekameli.The area is incongruous, shambolic, exciting – and it is this unique ambiance that St Jacques’ defenders want to preserve. From its vantage point on the hill, you can look down over the rather gloomy historic centre of Perpignan, a raffish and secretive city caught between republican France and Catalonia. Generally marginalised and free from most multinational chain stores, it is only Visa Pour l’Image, the annual photojournalism festival, that puts the city on the international map.As well as the ambiance, the collective wants to preserve St Jacques’ built environment: its tumbledown stacks of rough-hewn townhouses, which prop each other up on 14th-century earth foundations.“What was built wasn’t exceptional – it’s not palaces or anything – but it has an overall sense of history, where every edifice has its own particularities,” says Jean-Bernard Mathon, head of the Association for the Preservation of Roussillon Artistic and Historic Heritage.Mathon’s group wants to see renovation, not demolition. It is aghast at the prospect of the brusque, Hausmannian overhaul proposed by the government, which is funding nearly half of the €100m, with the town hall and regional bodies providing much of the rest.The locals don’t trust the authorities either. At the end of the gully of Rue de Quinze Degrés, a series of concrete blocks shields a building site, with a matrix of wooden beams bracing the buildings on either side. An irate-looking pensioner on his porch shakes his walking stick at it: “It’s been like that for a year, and they do nothing.” Does he trust the municipality to renovate? “They’re bastards!”The problem for the heritage brigade is the Gypsy community’s own lack of unequivocal support. Whereas the wider collective want to see the decrepit buildings renovated instead of demolished, many Gypsies’ stance is less cut and dried. “Nick” Gimenez (real name Jean-François), the uncle of Alain Gimenez, is one of the community patriarchs. He says his community would be happy to accept demolition as long as new social housing replaces it as promised. “We’re not bothered about heritage,” he says. “The question for us if that, if they demolish, they rehouse us immediately.”This bet-hedging gives the impression that the Gypsy community sees the heritage campaigners as useful allies in a bigger battle: to keep control of the neighbourhood.It is undeniable that St Jacques is a refuge for Gypsies. And it has always been a place for the excluded. A Middle Ages leper colony, it became the Jewish ghetto after the expulsion of Jews from Spanish Roussillon in 1492. Some current inhabitants claim Gypsies have been on the hill, cresting where the turreted 13th-century Catholic church stands, for centuries. Recorded history suggests most families arrived in the 1940s after the Vichy regime banned nomadism.The community’s isolation truly began in the 1960s and 1970s, as the historic Gypsy trades – horse-breeding, scrap-metal-collecting, knife-sharpening – fell out of favour. A kind of underclass alienation started to creep in, cutting them off from other nearby Gypsy enclaves, as well as their ethnic heritage. “It’s not that joyful nomadic rootlessness,” emphasises David Cook, a music producer who lives in St Jacques. “Where you’re always free to move and discover something else.”Keeping them further locked into this dependency is their dysfunctional relationship with Perpignan officialdom. There has been a longstanding practice of hiring influential community members for key town-hall roles: Nick Gimenez, for instance, organised St Jacques street-cleaning for several decades.People across Perpignan allege that this electoral malpractice continued in less blatant form under Alduy’s son, Jean-Paul, mayor from 1993 to 2009. L’Express also reported how, following the 1995 municipal elections, St Jacques was awash in brand-new scooters and fridges offered in exchange for the community vote. Jean-Paul Alduy today dismisses the idea as “completely crazy” he says some Gypsies used their allocation de rentrée scolaire, a state benefit for the September return to school, to purchase these goods.“For them, public money doesn’t come from the state. It’s always something that comes from the town hall,” he says. That was, he says, the origin of the rumour it was the town hall who had bequeathed the new swag. “One has to admit that everybody has always practised clientelism here,” says Amiel.Some of the St Jacques Gypsies, without true democratic representation through which to improve living conditions, have sometimes bridled at this deal: in the 2014 municipal elections, Nick Gimenez abruptly switched his political endorsement to the far-right Front National, a party not exactly known for its love of Gypsy culture, allegedly over a dispute with Jean-Marc Pujol, the current mayor, regarding Gimenez’s annual party at the Visa Pour l’Image festival.This toxic interdependency of Perpignan’s political class and the Gypsy community has so far hindered true reform in the neighbourhood. Even over the Ilot Puig block, there were Machiavellian forces at play. The French alternative news site Mediapart reported that the local representative for the République En Marche party, Romain Grau, who is the current frontrunner for the city’s 2020 mayoral elections, had encouraged the St Jacques collective to protest.Olivier Amiel, the assistant mayor, is adamant that the pas de deux between city and Gypsies must come to an end. “If the community continues to participate in clientelism, it’s suicidal in view of the social and economic situation,” he says in the Café de la Loge, across the street from the 14th-century town hall. “And if we do it, it’s criminal: we’d be guilty of killing a community.”As head of urbanism, Amiel has been the figurehead of the regeneration plans. It has made him a pariah in St Jacques, but his determination is obvious. The protest “has become something partisan, political, clan-based and even family-based”, he says, sipping a café noisette.He is not afraid to name names: he accuses Alain Gimenez of rousing the community in revenge for being refused a job with the municipality. Gimenez rejects the accusation: he insists that far from wanting a job, he turned down several job offers at town hall that he says were offered to him after the protests to buy him off.The 40-year-old Amiel, spindly and debonair in a dark suit, grey hair threaded through his black curls, likes to present himself in the post-Blair progressive mould as the bright young reformer (though he has been recently stripped of his powers after announcing his intention to run for mayor next year.) On his Twitter account, he fanboyishly outs himself as “the only French politician supported by Bret Easton Ellis”. After visiting Detroit, another destitute city that tried to bounce back, he wrote a manifesto for “positive gentrification”.Judging by a video he produced for the municipality, his vision of St Jacques reborn is the stuff of regeneration projects Europe-wide: lots of sanitised, glass-balconied, medium-density flats. When asked about the lack of reconstruction so far in St Jacques, Amiel says the demolitions must happen first. He claims that renovating the entire neighbourhood would be too expensive, citing an average price of €3,000 per square metre to overhaul the social housing, which would be too much for Gypsy tenants living in poverty to recoup in rent. Demolition and reconstruction would be half the cost, he insists.Besides, he says, beyond preventing other Marseille-style house tragedies, he sees regeneration as a broader social project: a way of ending the ghettoisation of St Jacques and the permissive misrule that he thinks has spread in the neighbourhood.Amiel proposes greater mixité – mixing – as the solution. You wonder how feasible this is. The insularity of many Gypsies here, which is reinforced by the wider prejudice toward its population across southern Europe, has a powerful social gravity all of its own. Aspects of Gypsy culture don’t mix easily with mainstream French culture. For example, girls are often pulled out of school early to ensure they don’t mix with boys, preserving their virginity for marriage. Many of the St Jacques Gypsies say these practices are a part of a culture that nourishes them with an irreplaceable solidarity.“We have a way of life that, for us, is better than yours,” Alain Gimenez tells me. “I say this to French people: go to a retirement home and you’ll see no Gypsy in there. We keep our old people with us.”This insularity even manifests itself physically on the streets, in what David Cook calls the Gypsies’ “strange relationship between inside and outside. The insides are spick and . But all this rubbish must leave this clean space immediately – so out of the window!” The Gypsy community has established safe boundaries in the neighbourhood, hence the acute suspicion about the town hall’s intentions, particularly the idea of non-Gypsies moving into new apartments. “There’s a kind of critical mass of population that if they fall below it, if it becomes too diluted, their lifestyle is threatened,” says Cook.To break down this entrenchment, the Gypsy community will need to be convinced that the St Jacques plans will benefit them. That is where the town hall’s communication strategy comes in. The official documents are opaque, full of complex figures and acronyms that are difficult to understand for anyone. Beyond the number of rooms, there is little functional detail about the new housing to excite any future inhabitants. Amiel mentions a series of public consultations, but they have been poorly attended.Word of mouth remains the key medium, via community figureheads such as Gimenez and local evangelical pastors. But that leaves plenty of scope for misinterpretation and manipulation.Jean-Bernard Mathon, of the heritage brigade, is suspicious of Perpignan’s master regeneration plan.Renovation, he insists, is not being properly explored. He believes it can be done cheaper than the town hall’s estimates, and has asked for an independent evaluation. He also disputes the idea that his group is solely motivated by a middle-class preoccupation with preserving the past: “Beyond the questions of demolition or renovation, you have to take into account the psychological aspect – people are terrorised by demolition.”Pujol, the mayor, insists the city would prefer not to demolish, and instead to sell expropriated properties to people who would fix them up. “But there are no buyers,” he says. “The reality, which no one wants to recognise, is that no one wants to buy in St Jacques.”This may be changing. As Pujol admits, there is a small real-estate buzz at the neighbourhood’s edge a Paris property company is rumoured to be canvassing residents about selling their houses.What is more, nearly two-thirds of the 236 new buildings planned for St Jacques will be sold on the open market. The remaining 92 units are social housing, but many of the Gypsies believe that it in reality they are destined to be student accommodation: the University of Perpignan’s huge new Campus Mailly development is bringing 1,350 law students right next door to St Jacques in 2020. Amiel denies this, saying the floorplan of the proposed social housing is too large for student use.Whatever the truth, Perpignan’s stealth-gentrification conspiracy theory has taken hold: an insidious plan to raise property values in a dilapidated but historic section of Perpignan while slowly siphoning off its populace, with no one responsible but “the market”.Abruptly, in April this year, a kind of murky light broke over the Ilot Puig. The Office Public de L’Habitat Public (OPH), the French body responsible for social housing, announced that bids for Perpignan’s redevelopment had gone out to tender – and also said the option of renovation is back on the table.“We’ve won,” says Alain Gimenez at an outdoor cafe table at Place Cassanyes, St Jacques’ other major square. Nearby, Nasser, the main representative for the collective’s north Africans, is simultaneously sorting out Gimenez’s internet subscription on the phone and selling globe artichokes from a car boot.However, it also turns out that Gimenez and Nasser have been offered jobs with the OPH – and both accepted. Gimenez previously insisted he had refused multiple job offers during the campaign. Does this mean he has now been bought?No, he says, slapping the table – those who’ve suggested this have got it wrong. “They don’t know how we came to an agreement. We gave the town hall two conditions for the Ilot Puig: one, you renovate the houses there. And two, it’s us who’ll take care of the work and decide who gets to live there. I said to them: don’t try greasing my palms, or I’ll have the mayor for breakfast.” He waves to his grandchildren, who are passing by in a car.The OPH declined to comment on the circumstances and conditions of Gimenez and Nasser’s hiring. The town hall did not respond to questions on the matter.Whatever deal they agreed, if any, the fate of Ilot Puig remains uncertain the results of the tender will be announced in September. Gimenez never argued unequivocally for renovation: could he just be claiming it as a possibility now in order to declare a “victory” and save face with the rest of the collective? And what of the future of the rest of St Jacques? Gimenez claims he will not stop fighting the demolitions – “No, never. The fight will carry on until Pujol has left, and maybe under the next mayor” – but now that he’s working for a government housing agency intrinsically involved in the redevelopment, it’s hard to see how that would work.Let’s hope he means what he says. The Ilot Puig campaign looked like a shot at self-determination for the wider Gypsy community, not just those members who enjoy privileged access to power. If the leaders of the protest abandon it for preferential treatment, this brief window for civic engagement could quickly slam shut. Whether St Jacques is regenerated or renovated, the choice should be the Gypsies’, free from manipulation by ambitious politicians or from the short-term demands of the daily grind.For now, the informal nightlife economy continues to thrive in full view of the old police station, the town hall is still claiming it wants to save the Gypsies, and the mantra of the TV show The Wire continues to apply in Perpignan as it does in cities across the world: it’s all in the game.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7226863109665f0e4cfe6a2c1c63c312835f73b/0_0_2000_2500/master/2000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=26e97244e6ef3b15e18d66b85a1c5efb 2020w","title":"the guardian view on tory purges a historic betrayal","story":"By forcing sensible, moderate MPs into exile Boris Johnson is extinguishing a valuable Conservative tradition in British politicsThe intensity of the current political crisis can dull the impact of events that would, in quieter times, be explosive. Until recently it was hard to imagine Ken Clarke’s political affiliation as anything other than Conservative. He has served in government under four Tory prime ministers. But Mr Clarke and 20 parliamentary colleagues have been driven into exile from Boris Johnson’s party. Their offence was supporting a cross-party bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The bill passed its second Commons reading on Wednesday by a majority of 29. Mr Johnson’s aggressive tactics, withdrawing the whip from dissenters, emboldened their rebellion.This is evidence not of the rebels shedding their Tory values but of the party abandoning its roots. Mr Johnson’s eagerness to shred the UK’s relations with its closest neighbours is one symptom of that change. His readiness to defy conventions that underpin democracy is another. Conservatives have harboured suspicion of the European project since the UK joined in 1973, but the party has mutated into something more extreme than was ever advocated by orthodox Tory Eurosceptics. Brexit is no longer a conservative programme for economic or constitutional reform. It is a faith-based revolution in the way the UK is governed.The prime minister himself may not see it in those terms. He has no constant belief, aside from confidence in his own entitlement to high office. Brexit happens to be the most powerful vehicle he could find at an opportune moment in pursuit of his ambition. But he is not the driver. Mr Johnson is a hostage to the same ideological sect that besieged, captured and destroyed Theresa May’s administration. The current Tory leader is unlike his predecessor in style and temperament, but he has made the same fundamental misjudgments: that support from his party’s radical English nationalist wing can be borrowed on a temporary basis that the hardliners can be placated, co-opted or controlled.Mr Johnson says his preference is for Brexit on orderly terms but his preference hardly matters when he has mortgaged his office to people who see any accommodation with Brussels as treason. He signals capitulation to that ethos by referring to the rebels’ plan to avoid no deal as a “surrender bill”, an insidious device to present legitimate democratic opposition as collusion with an enemy. He has also decried pro-European MPs’ “collaboration” with Brussels.This belligerent idiom is certain to resonate with the far right, although Downing Street would never admit to cultivating that audience. When it suits him, Mr Johnson presents himself as a social and economic liberal in the “one nation” Tory tradition. Maybe he even believes it. But his Brexit stance has alienated the voters who would be attracted to such a candidate. He cannot appeal to remainers, and liberal leavers are a niche constituency. Electoral logic thus requires that Mr Johnson appeal to supporters of Nigel Farage. He needs to reassemble the voter coalition that delivered referendum victory for the 2016 leave campaign. Naturally, he defers to that campaign’s mastermind, Dominic Cummings, a restless revolutionary with no respect for or attachment to historic political institutions, including the Conservative party.Mr Johnson won the Tory leadership by posing as the candidate who could deliver Brexit and win an election. He did not say that his method involved purging the party of dissenters, despising its pluralist history, reinventing it as something anti-conservative and risking its destruction in the process.He has already engineered the loss of the Tories’ majority in the Commons and surrendered control of the legislative agenda to opposition MPs. His discomfort in parliament on Wednesday was palpable, although he tried to mask it with the usual repertoire of bluster. In one awkward peroration, the prime minister declared: “Britain needs sensible, moderate, progressive Conservative government.” Even by Mr Johnson’s standards it was a moment of exquisite hypocrisy, identifying precisely the Tory tradition that his agenda and methods seem certain to extinguish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/390424ec02601f2b605ec2846ba53dbd7654d401/0_297_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e203b763f564d9be883e26a45cbf522f","title":"ilhan omar send her back somalia us foreign policy","story":"When a rally parroted Trump’s remark about Ilhan Omar, few were aware the US has been conducting drone strikes and combat operations against al-ShabaabIn July, a crowd at a Trump rally chanted “send her back” about the Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar, parroting Trump’s suggestion that she “go back” to Somalia, from which she immigrated as a child. Shortly after, the Kentucky senator Rand Paul offered to buy Omar a plane ticket back to Somalia so that she would be more appreciative of her American home. What few commentators have mentioned is that, when it comes to Somalia, “send her back” is not just racist and offensive. It also completely ignores the critical role of US foreign policy over the past several decades in contributing to what Paul called “the disaster that is Somalia”.According to the report, authored by the Colby College professor Catherine Besteman, US actions in Somalia are predicated on a misreading of the local context. Al-Shabaab is not just a terrorist group in the sense of a group that commits violence against civilians, it is also a local resistance movement against foreign interventionism.The US has played a significant role in Somali politics for decades, starting in the 1970s supporting Somalia’s brutal dictator, Siad Barre, during the cold war, and later attempting ineffectually to rebuild the collapsed state. In 1993, when the infamous Black Hawk Down incident occurred, the US military withdrew from Somalia after a local militia group shot down an American helicopter that was going after its leaders. After 911, however, the US once more began conducting military operations in Somalia as the report states: “US security panics identified Somalia’s ongoing statelessness as offering a potential opportunity for terrorists.” Al-Shabaab has been gaining strength and power ever since, fueled by Somali rage over now decades-long foreign interference in their country. Thus the growth of al-Shabaab has not only been fed by a long history of US operations in Somalia but also by the current US war against it.Today, US military policy in Somalia ignores al-Shabaab’s deep ties to the Somali government, business interests, Somali national security forces, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and regional entities. For example, it raises funds by smuggling illicit exports of charcoal and sugar, evading a UN ban on such exports, with the collusion of regional government. Members of the Somali national army and its US-trained elite force, Danab, even provide the US with incorrect information about al-Shabaab’s location to minimize the affect of drone strikes on the organization.America’s counterterrorism strategy has not lessened the impact of al-Shabaab activities. If anything, US actions have, according to the report, “augmented al-Shabaab’s ability to control the local population because al-Shabaab is so tightly connected to the war economy and benefits directly from it”. The money coming in from the US and elsewhere for security operations against al-Shabaab sustains the economy, and “the security economy is the economy in Somalia”. In other words, Besteman writes: “The war is good for business and business makes profit out of war.” Because of this, the US’s success in containing al-Shabaab over the long term through military actions is highly improbable.The high cost of the US war in Somalia is borne by the Somali people. In March, Amnesty International called for the US government to investigate credible evidence that its airstrikes have killed numerous civilians in Somalia, despite the denial of most of these deaths by US Africa Command (AfriCom). Caught between the extortion of al-Shabaab and US bombs, Somalis are struggling to forge secure livelihoods and self governance. Millions have fled their homes to take refuge both within Somalia’s borders and beyond. Decades of political turmoil in Somalia and US military operations since the early 2000s have led to 4 million people living in dire conditions and in need of humanitarian assistance.Given that al-Shabaab is so enmeshed with prevailing business and political interests, and that foreign militarism has just propelled the group onwards, it is absurd to continue combatting the group with military force, as the US has been focused on doing. Moreover, it is cruel. US lawmakers, pushed by human rights groups, have started to take steps towards ending America’s role in the atrocious human rights violations of the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Now its time to do the same with Somalia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39676871912f4808f37000eecd4b5de5124ff1bc/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=390512d1697dbd21722ee2dc7e2d5a03","title":"schools teach lgbt september 2020 new regulations","story":"Students across the country are heading back to school this week, and while this might not seem momentous, for Stonewall, this school year marks the beginning of the end of a decades-long campaign to get an inclusive education system in England. In September 2020, new regulations for teaching relationships and sex education (RSE) in English schools come into force. It will be a landmark moment – a whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBT people and same-sex relationships, but also celebrate and offer support on the issues that young LGBT people face.The guidance means that primary schools will teach about different families, which of course includes LGBT families. Contrary to what’s been said by some online and in the media, this is just about showing kids that families can have two mums or two dads. Or to put another way: different families, same love. If you, like me, were at school in the 1980s and 90s you endured an education system that erased LGBT people and history. In 1989, section 28 banned local authorities from “promoting homosexuality”. Without any recognition or inclusion, and with teachers essentially banned from reprimanding those who used homophobic slurs, bullying flourished and scarred a generation of young people. Growing up as a gay boy in Kent was hard. Schools couldn’t even acknowledge the existence of gay people, let alone talk about the challenges we faced – I felt totally isolated and afraid of being found out. All the while, the media wrote stories about lesbian, gay and bi people arguing that children would be “turned” gay if they were taught about same-sex relationships. I had few role models and was left feeling ashamed of who I was. During my entire school career I couldn’t accept my sexuality, let alone be open about it.However, if this is to be effective, the government (whoever that might be) has to invest in training to prepare teachers and schools. All schools need to have the resources and time to engage with parents and carers, and explain how they will teach these subjects in a way that benefits children from all backgrounds. To make this happen, we want people to write to their local authorities and be vocal in their support for inclusive education, so that every child can grow up and reach their full potential.Inclusive teaching is an affirmation that you exist, and your identity is valid. It’s also not just about lesbian, gay, bi and trans people. It’s crucial that people realise that there’s no hierarchy in this teaching. It’s about acceptance for people from all backgrounds – be that race, gender, sexual orientation, faith, class andor disability. This kind of teaching will help foster greater inclusion, acceptance and understanding in our classrooms, playgrounds and school corridors.I’m under no illusion that it will be plain sailing or that there’ll be no more disruptions outside schools. A vocal minority have gained a platform with anti-ersity rhetoric that seeks to target LGBT people and ide communities. Some protesters claim that a move towards inclusive education is against their religion. This perpetuates a harmful myth that faith and LGBT inclusion cannot coexist. Faith is a big part of many LGBT people’s lives and many of them have spoken out in support of LGBT-inclusive education. Unfortunately, this situation is being used by some groups to further inflame Islamophobic and anti-faith attitudes. We must be vigilant to this and push against those who seek to sow ision.Inclusive education helps to create inclusive communities. Building a more welcoming society requires building bridges between erse groups. If all schools teach acceptance – no exceptions – then that would be a good first step to healing some of the ision that we’ve seen in society over the past decade.• Paul Twocock is interim chief executive at Stonewall"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/389c68006cbf8f9d86bbce718185fb3ea00ac124/528_114_3939_2364/master/3939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da1d92ab6e13a0147ca6d26d418ed339","title":"astronauts breast milk chewed gum being human in pictures","story":"Being Human, a new permanent gallery at Wellcome Collection in London, explores what it means to be human in the 21st century.

It was one of the great delights of making that film - that I could hear these new songs - songs that I had no right to expect and had done nothing to deserve - emerge - and be so perfect.Richard, that stabbing between the fingers thing on the IT crowd.

But after your screenwriting and directing in Submarine and The Double revealed the extraordinarily breadth of your artistic talent, critics and film fans have been looking forward to your next film project.I hope this enquiry hasn’t been too personal in nature. Please accept my heartfelt thanks for all your work, and my best wishes for your future happiness and artistic fulfilment.This is a very kind and thoughtful question, and I find it hard not to default to glib - but I think everyone is probably trying to balance various things - I feel lucky that I was able to get to make any films at all - I never thought I would - but I feel much more lucky to be married and have children (but even that feels like a false comparisonequivalence) - and I would have to think very carefully about anything that meant I would have to be in absentia for an extended period.That said, we don\u0027t share a house.That is a joke.

My question: When you directed the most perfect television episode, ever, the US sitcom Community episode, which perfectly parodied both Pulp Fiction and My Dinner With Andre, did you watch the films immediately prior to directing the episode, or do it from memory?

Since 2000, in fact, when he and Matthew Holness created spoof horror author Garth Marenghi, who’d transition from Edinburgh stage to Channel 4 show (all the while penning books like Afterbirth, in which a mutated placenta attacks Bristol, and Black Fang, which asks the question: what if a rat could drive a bus?)Ever since, Ayoade has appeared in everything from The Mighty Boosh (as the belligerent shaman Saboo) to Danger Mouse (an evil snowman). He has presented every TV show, from the rebooted The Crystal Maze to his celebrity adventures on Travel Man. He has also directed everything from music videos (for bands like Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) to feature films (his 2011 debut Submarine and a film of Dostoevsky’s The Double in 2014). And now the pinnacle of his career: joining us for a webchat on Thursday 5 September at 12pm BST.His latest project is a book called Ayoade On Top, a sort-of-memoir-cum-ode to the film Gwyneth Paltrow once called the worst she’s ever been in: View From the Top, in which Ayoade argues for the canonisation of “this brutal masterpiece”. Ayoade on Top is published by Faber on 5 September.

It will feature four big names from the world of music on its inaugural covers: flamenco-pop star Rosalia, US rapper Tyler, the Creator former One Direction star Harry Styles and British-Albanian singer Dua Lipa.Given the Face was originally a music mag “first and foremost”, according to the editor, Stuart Brumfitt, he wanted to relaunch with music covers. But it felt right not to have just one star. “We didn’t feel like right now there was necessarily one person who defined the moment for us. We just like the fact that pop music is having this incredible moment and there’s such a great range of characters.”The magazine, known as a cultural touchstone and style bible throughout the 80s, is credited with helping to launch the career of Kate Moss, who appeared on the cover, shot by Corinne Day, in 1990, as well as those of the photographer Juergen Teller and the designer Alexander McQueen. It became, in the words of a former contributor, Alex Needham, a “global byword for cool, and a lifeline for readers dreaming of hanging out in the Wag club but stuck miles away in the sticks”.Bringing back such a cultural titan, which at its peak sold 70,000 copies a month, is a big task, but Brumfitt is “just excited really, not daunted at all”. Having launched the website in April, the team have had, he says, “a good few months of finding out what kind of content we want to create and what kind of stories we wanted to tell, what kind of images we like”.For Brumfitt, the thing he loved as a reader in the late 90s and early 00s was the mix of content. “It could do highlow, undergroundpopular … Any great magazine for me is somewhere you can go from something about an underground club night to something more serious and political to a great fashion shoot.”True to that ideal, Brumfitt says we can expect “a slightly bonkers mix” in the relaunch. Issue one darts from an interview with the England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to a feature about what fame does to the brain. There’s an interview with two of the actors who are part of the first black family on Coronation Street, a piece speaking to people who do LSD to have “more exciting, meaningful sex”, a 10-page guest edit from the TV presenter and naturalist Chris Packham, a Q\u0026ampA with Liam Gallagher and a guide to the tech-wear pagan revival in Somerset. Brumfitt thinks the varied content will work for young people used, via YouTube and Instagram, to hopping from one thing to another.The magazine’s 24-year run came to a complicated end in 2004 and there have been questions raised about the wisdom of relaunching the magazine at all, but specifically about relaunching a print publication in a digital age. Brumfitt, however, has no qualms: “I just think a magazine like it needs to exist.”A voracious reader of magazines until five or 10 years ago, Brumfitt doesn’t think he stopped reading them because he went off print. “I think it’s just that there weren’t the magazines filled with the kind of content I want to read.” A lot of fashion and style magazines have, he says, “become much more image-based, kind of portfolios of photographers and stylists, which is great if you’re specifically into that”. He wants to be sure to “put some emphasis back on stories and thinking and discussion, so you can read and learn but also see amazing images and fashion, the best photography and graphic design all in one place”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3aadce3ce558815932ecb13c2859cf14a300d4d/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baecb763b1c5a5d85805d46961c331e1","title":"a batman v joker movie could make marvels avengers look like the powerpuff girls","story":"Could Warner Bros finally match Marvel’s box office might with a mini-verse featuring Robert Pattinson’s caped crusader and Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck?Where Marvel continues to revel in an orgy of interconnectedness, the imminent launch of new superhero shows on the Disney+ channel being perhaps the apex of this splurge of comic book joined-up thinking, DC seems hellbent on going in the opposite direction.After 2017’s Justice League failed to leap tall buildings in a single bound and the previous year’s Suicide Squad slumped languidly into the shadows, Warner Bros’s subsequent DC movies have taken a narrower approach to world-building, with some success.

So much so that it is tempting to wonder if the long-mooted DC Extended Universe, always planned as a Marvel-aping excuse to cross-pollinate the publisher’s entire back catalogue, has already met an untimely demise.James Gunn’s upcoming Suicide Squad 2 may do its best to pull out the creative defibrillator when it finally debuts in 2021, but in the meantime, there are rumours of a rather more intriguing example of inter-superhero shenanigans. Could Robert Pattinson’s Batman really end up in the same movie as Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, currently picking up rave reviews in Venice? A slip of the tongue by Pattinson in a new interview suggests so.The prospect has a certain synergy to it, because both actors have made a home for themselves as doyens of the arthouse film, even if their careers started off in very different places. It is hard to imagine a Batman movie featuring Phoenix’s Scorsese-inspired, 70s crime movie-style take on the clown prince of Gotham not hitting it off creatively with the taciturn caped crusader everyone hopes to see in Matt Reeves’ forthcoming The Batman. The inclusion of both actors hints at a character-driven, cine-literate piece that couldn’t be further from the monstrously lightweight CGI-strewn nonsense of the worst DC releases. Why bother to set up Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck in such detail if he merely exists to be retooled as a common baddie in future instalments?Of course, the inclusion of top talent doesn’t always guarantee quality film-making – just ask the Oscar-winning Jared Leto, sort-of star of Suicide Squad, in which he played a version of the Joker so superfluous to events it would probably have been easier and cheaper to render the villain entirely via CGI. But setting Pattinson against Phoenix would at least create the kind of positive buzz around a major movie event that Warner needs if it is ever to match Marvel’s box office might and critical currency.The hype around Joker is such that Warner would be foolish not to make Todd Phillips’ film a jumping-off point for a fresh Gotham-themed mini-universe. Perhaps DC fans might even find themselves gifted the interconnected series of movies that the DC Extended Universe was intended to usher in, through a surprising route. If Warner has largely failed in its efforts to mimic Marvel’s industry-shaking success, that does not mean the studio cannot find an alternate, more organic route to world-building that better fits the superheroes and film-makers at its disposal.Naysayers might point out that Phoenix’s Joker seems to be living in a different timeline to Pattinson’s version of Batman. Bruce Wayne’s father Thomas appears in Phillips’ movie as a tyrannical Trump figure, played by 63-year-old actor Brett Cullen, while Wayne is portrayed by nine-year-old actor Dante Pereira-Olson. This suggests Phoenix’s Fleck won’t be battling a Pattinson-aged caped crusader for at least a decade or two. On the other hand, that gives DC plenty of time to finally get this new cinematic mini-verse right. The fan anticipation that would build in the meantime could be enough to make the Avengers look like the Powerpuff Girls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad40cf6c680510cb3170e848b095f9b67dd80b86/145_0_893_536/master/893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a806a1f4dc1ab9212fba62e6e613262a","title":"sprinter review jamaica athletics drama","story":"A Jamaican athlete’s career is jeopardised by problems off the track in this heartwarming tale of ambition and family tiesHere’s a heartfelt sports drama from Jamaica made in the traditional style, about a teenage athlete who dreams of using his blistering talent to give his family a better life. Does the kid have sufficient grit to make it to the finish line?Sprinter is a movie that leaves virtually no sporting cliche unbothered, yet it’s rooted in a naturalistic, emotional family drama reflecting the specific pleasures and perils of life in Jamaica. Storm Saulter directs with energy and style, with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith as executive producers.Dale Elliott plays Akeem, an exceptional 200-metre sprinter. A warm, easygoing kid, he’s nicknamed the Rasta Rocket and is already a national hero. But family problems are distracting him. Akeem’s mum (Lorraine Toussaint from Orange Is the New Black) has been working illegally in the US for a decade. His dad (Dennis Titus) is lonely, worn out from raising two sons alone, and drinking heavily. Akeem’s older brother Germaine (Kadeem Wilson) is living proof of the dangers of trusting in sport as a ticket out. Once a hot favourite 400- metre runner, Germaine picked up an injury. Now he’s a working for a local gangster.For a film about an athlete, Sprinter dawdles to a finish, as Akeem struggles with concentration ahead of a make-or-break race. Still, it’s impossible not to root for this movie. Newcomer Elliott is such an open presence, and the stakes for Akeem, and other explosively talented kids like him, are so high.Jamaica has been unveiled as a major location in the new Bond film, but let’s have more films about Jamaican people living their lives, please.• Sprinter is released in the UK on 6 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969503f1df33b0d2a59a594eb11573a9d66dd85c/0_175_2469_1481/master/2469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acc468eb5824ac77fbdeabff3d7b86e4","title":"why the third man is an essential primer for no deal brexit","story":"As the classic noir gets a 70th anniversary re-release, it’s hard to ignore the parallels between a shattered postwar Vienna teeming with spivs and the future the Brexiters have in mindWhat perfect timing for The Third Man to step back out of the shadows. Often hailed as the finest film Britain ever made, a 70th anniversary re-release will see it return to cinemas with the government much in the market for symbols of national grandeur. While Boris Johnson has named his favourite film as Dodgeball – for once, eerily believable – as the great British breakdown goes on it is easy to imagine him waving a tiny Union Jack at Carol Reed’s majestic noir.It is true, of course, that there could be no better moment for The Third Man to reappear – just not as a cosy patriotic treat. Rather, it is a cold premonition of no-deal Britain.In that, there is a certain poetry. We are where we are in no small part due to endless British war films convincing a generation born in the 1950s that they had lived through the Blitz and could only be happy back in it. But The Third Man is a postwar movie. American hack writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna to meet, then mourn, his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but the city he finds tells a bitter truth about life after wartime. “Smashed and dreary,” the screenwriter, Graham Greene, wrote in the novella drafted as a treatment.Barring the unexpected, we may still live to see the resemblance. The cosplayers will sputter that Austria was on the losing side in the second world war, ignoring that Britain can’t help but lose the re-enactment, given we’re the only ones fighting it. With Europe declining to drive us into the shelters, no deal provides the solution by dropping a bomb on ourselves.Reed and Greene show us the future that follows. “The classic period of the black market,” the voiceover calls it, an ugly scuttle of murky characters and fraught borders, an impoverished place carved up by predatory powers. The screen fills with parallels between then and our soon-to-be now. Official versions of Harry’s death hum with organised disinformation his lover Anna is a refugee, terrified of being caught with the wrong papers malign Russian influence lurks.But most of all, there are the vultures. To the crooks Greene found at work in the Viennese debris, the godsend of war was allowing them room to get rich. No Deal will be the same: a once-in-a-lifetime chance to tip a whole country into a handful of pockets. Disaster capitalism is just the modern name. There must be a catastrophe – because only that upheaval can allow the firesale of public assets and small businesses, the accompanying wave of deregulation, Britain remade as an offshore hidey-hole that asks no questions (and where those who do ask regret it).Enter – in that deathless flash of nightlight – Harry Lime. Because what is Lime if not a pioneer disaster capitalist, grasping the opportunities presented by chaos with a stash of tainted penicillin? Now, near the endgame, the point of the past three years is obvious – making possible the feral economy in which business minds such as Harry thrive, stripped of “red tape”, profit its own unarguable logic. “Free of income tax, old man,” he twinkles.It almost feels too on-the-nose that his racket takes place in the ultimate captive market – medicine. When the film was first released, the NHS was a year old. Now, it survives as the grand prize in a US trade deal Britons are assured we are first in line for, an army of Harrys poised to sell us an opioid epidemic and health insurance bankruptcies.With his loathing of American empire, Greene would be unsurprised to find Big Pharma circling. Yet at first, his villain sprang from closer to home. In Greene’s original novella, Lime and Martins were not Americans, but British subjects, old pals from private school. Harry’s crimes in Vienna are, we discover, those of a charismatic English scoundrel educated to rig the system.Indeed. It would be interesting to know what the current prime minister makes of Harry Lime – a habitual liar, his moral failures stuffed behind rogueish affability, an amply scaled betrayer of women, a nihilist and narcissist bulldozing through life with a bone-deep conviction that, as the novella puts it, “his happiness will make the world’s day”. Greene knew the type. He knew the poison in our golf clubs and members bars. The spivs and grotesques now running the country might have stepped whole from his pages, whipping up nationalism while discreetly betting against the pound and arranging second passports.High on the ferris wheel at the ghostly Prater amusement park, Harry prices up the tiny lives below. “Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving?” Now, the maths of no deal are only deranged if you value those dots above your investment fund. And we – car-factory workers, sheep farmers, research scientists, even film critics, all of us – wander below.The funny thing is that Britain’s greatest film was only ever part British anyway. Aside from the involvement of the Hollywood veteran David Selznick and the Anglo-Hungarian producer Alexander Korda, Greene learned of the real-life penicillin racket in Vienna from the Austrian journalist Peter Smolka. Our ruling ghoul squad would no doubt shriek that the continental influence explains the negativity. Others will see Smolka as a small but telling detail in pinning down how a 70-year-old film could map so closely on to our present debacle – an eyewitness to what happens once the rot sets in.How does it end? In 1949, American interests won the day: Greene was overruled by Selznick as to how to close the story. The mogul was proved right, refusing Greene’s original happy ending for a cynical parting note. For anyone who has never seen this cruelly brilliant film and wonders what it says about the road ahead, here is the spoiler warning. There is a funeral, a long solitary walk and then a fade to black.The Third Man is re-released for one day only on 29 September, and on DVD and Blu-Ray later in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09665aa2d469ec6311fe8ebf39c7c6a7678214b4/302_376_4574_2745/master/4574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb08ffa6fa96cc1518862949a15a94f2","title":"canned applause why tinned food isnt just for brexit","story":"From the expensive delights of Spanish anchovies to Jamaica’s humbler ackee or callaloo, some things actually taste all the better for coming in a canOK, stockpiling jokes really aren’t funny any more, but the following thoughts have absolutely nothing to do with the political disgrace that engulfs us. It is purely by coincidence that I am thinking a lot about food that works in cans. That, and bodybags.There is a category of food that is denatured by the canning process yet still delicious – such as sweetcorn, which loses its bite and takes on an almost waxy texture that is charming, maybe nostalgically. It tastes of church fetes and train journeys, diets you went on in teenagehood before you heard of the glycemic index. Spaghetti hoops, likewise – nothing like spaghetti in any real sense (unnaturally soft, sauce like service station ketchup) but intensely pleasing in a toast context, a delinquent double-carb on a par with a chip butty. Baked beans are universally faultless I don’t even mind the low-salt and sugar versions. These are foods it is not possible to ruin.That is not what I am interested in, however not for the moment. I am interested in the chic, in the statement, in the can you could open and serve to your spouse’s boss if you were Samantha from Bewitched (Google that, millennials). I’m interested in the food that turns to silk, to spun gold.Obviously, fish: anchovies of any provenance will work as a flavour bomb, which is plainly because of the salt more than anything else. Your standard supermarket anchovy tastes like a fish-infused crystallised salt, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But if you want to make the anchovy the star – the classic means of doing so is with bread, butter an inch thick, fish and shallots – they have to come from Santoña, on the north coast of Spain, where they only catch them between March and June, to make sure they are young. The eye-wateringly expensive Don Bocarte brand is said to use less salt, but they don’t taste any less salty, just fleshier, softer, less harsh, more miraculous.The fullest possible range of fish you could put in a tin is displayed like a gallery in Sol e Pesca, a cafe in Lisbon, Portugal: elephant tuna and abalone, mussels (smoked and not), octopus, squid. Octopus and mussels stay closest to their fresh texture, although canned tuna has been legitimised with familiarity and nobody would want it to taste as it does fresh.You would think you could write off all vegetables, and most of them you can: anything prized for its crunch is out, and the best thing you could do with a tinned carrot is to mash it before you start, so you are not expecting anything. But wait: hearts of palm take on a beautiful and quite varied texture, almost melting in the middle and crunchy at the outside. They could never remind you of anything else. Vegetables that would have been stewed anyway adapt brilliantly to canned life. The worst thing you could say about most canned ratatouille is that it is under-seasoned.I could not name a more stylish can-based dish than ackee and callaloo, which is eaten for breakfast in Jamaica but is deeply savoury and thus adaptable. Ackee is a fruit, known for its beautiful pip like a conker but, when stewed and canned, it takes on the texture of scrambled egg honestly, it could almost be mistaken for egg. Callaloo is a deep-green leaf vegetable, also stewed depending on your recipe, it is the consistency of saag, and seems to have a buttery slickness without butter. Together, ackee and callaloo make quite a sloppy ensemble, but you wouldn’t want it any other way.Of meat, I remain sceptical meatballs and frankfurters taste like hospital food when you can them. Classic French stews often need something from a can or they will take you a month to prepare – confit duck legs for a cassoulet, maybe – and those retain their integrity fine, if you can swallow their wowsome expense (though it would be rich of me to complain, after those anchovies).Cheese has been the canning surprise of this investigation I mean, I would not count stilton in a pot and nor would I entertain a tinned cheddar, even if I had ever seen one. But there is a Turkish manufacturer, Gazi, that does a range of cured sheep and goats’ milk cheeses that are grouped together as “nomad’s cheese” because, before cans were invented, they were cured and wrapped in animal skin to preserve them. Canned, they have an extraordinary shelf life of two years or so. They do not taste like classic feta they are a bit drier and crumblier despite their brine and have a more delicate flavour. If anything, they taste like cheeses from Georgia, almost neutral unless you concentrate, and then incredibly complex. You could do anything with these cheeses – salad, pastries, chop them into chickpeas. They are wonderful, with beautiful graphics featuring a surprised goat. Or sheep.I pass this on only in case of impromptu entertaining. No other reason, none at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46c5d8de92898a3b19ee752c12d918cf430984b7/94_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0785252b8fd05fb8e4d3439804bdf8ba","title":"food vegetables fast food texas healthy eating","story":"I grew up in Texas, where food is fast and portions are vast. It’s time to ditch the chicken and waffles and embrace the greensSeptember marks the end of summer and the start of a new school year. Parents and caregivers will soon begin packing school lunches or dispensing money into their children’s lunch accounts, leaving them at the mercy of the government for sustenance.My parents decided to go with the latter. They tried meal prepping before the term was even coined, but a kid can only eat so many Lunchables and peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. It was therefore agreed that my siblings and I would eat the standard cafeteria food at our public school.Maybe that’s where my problems began.Fast forward 15 years. I am now 24. It’s 7pm and I’m starving. I pull myself up three flights of stairs to my apartment. The day has flown by, and I’m feeling a little faint.My eyes scan the kitchen for something to eat. I open and close the cabinets and refrigerator door several times before deciding on … Cheetos. I eat about half the bag for dinner and watch season three of Stranger Things until I fall asleep on the couch. I wish Cheetos were carrots, I really do. I wish carrots tasted like Cheetos, but they taste like water and tree bark. And don’t even get me started on green vegetables.To be clear, this is not a junk food propaganda piece. I agree that most fast food is artificial (and probably carcinogenic). I try to limit myself to eating absolute garbage to just once a week, but considering I hate vegetables, that can be tricky.I suspect my hate affair with veggies can be traced to my Texas upbringing. I grew up in Houston, where we have the best tacos in the nation – not to mention the honey-butter chicken biscuit. The state-mandated fruit and vegetable requirement for public school cafeterias is three pieces of lettuce swimming in ranch dressing and a peach cobbler. And when I met up with friends after school, we’d go to Whataburger.My mother was a high school English teacher who went to college at night to complete her PhD. My dad was a traditionalist who came home from work at 7.30pm every night. I still don’t know what his job was (Finance? Consulting? The mafia?) but I knew the time he came home, because that’s when my brother and I would turn off the TV and run to the kitchen to hide our tortilla chips and ramen noodles. The sound of a garage door opening still strikes fear into my soul.My parents did not encourage junk food. In fact, when I would bring home Tastykakes or Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, I’d find them in the trash the next day. My mom was watching her weight and didn’t want to be tempted: she lost 60lb over the course of my middle school years. She never found my drawer of hidden snacks.Dinner was whatever my mom had made the previous night and left in the freezer. Sometimes it was lasagne, sometimes biryani. She made spinach and eggplant dishes quite often, but with no one to look over my shoulder when I was eating, I left it untouched. My father would eat on his chair in the living room while watching soccer or The West Wing while I ate in the kitchen, hogging the phone line talking to Kelly or Nicole about Kyle or Chad. (I lived in a very white suburb.)On the days my mom slaved over her dissertation on American syncretism, my dad would bring home McDonald’s or Chick-fil-A. Needless to say, I lived for those days. I felt like I would rather starve than eat another helping of rice, daal or cauliflower.College was another deterrent to living healthily. Though I worked out all the time with my fitness-crazed roommate, I lived above a Taco Bell and down the street from an establishment called the Potato Shack. A coffee, a beer or pretzels was considered a meal.For many Americans, this isn’t out of the ordinary. Food deserts form the tapestry of American cuisine,and most suburbs have a McDonald’s or a Burger King lurking nearby. Drive-thrus serving burgers, fries and milkshakes are common, but drive-thrus serving salads are rare gems, if any exist at all. Time and accessibility are factors that determine what the average American family decides to eat for dinner.You might envision me as a whale of a woman hunched over her laptop typing this with Cheeto-stained fingertips. While I’m not there (yet), my future is not bright if I continue on this path. No longer can I eat a family-size bag of Orville Redenbacher buttery popcorn and maintain my figure. I’m getting older and my hips don’t lie. Neither does my cholesterol.I’ve decided I’m better than that. I’m a grown woman living in New York who needs to suck it up and chow down on a salad. I’ve been experimenting with tricking myself into eating healthier – yes, like a toddler – so I grow into the habit.I’ve started eating zucchini noodles, which really do taste like spaghetti if you close your eyes and gulp them down. I discovered I love butternut squash soup. Granted, these are often preludes to a burger or ice cream, but I’m getting there. I’m also really into baba ganoush.I still enjoy working out, but as my best friend reminds me, abs are (allegedly) made in the kitchen. I know it’s time to abandon the Texas way and adopt a new lifestyle. I’m also sick of my judgmental colleagues, who sound like paid spokespeople for Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign. They never fail to mention they grow vegetables on the window sills of their Brooklyn apartments and how delicious they find kale. (Liars!) I won’t lie – my new health kick is partially due to my desire to not feel sluggish, but it’s mostly to get these annoying colleagues off my back.If you’re struggling to maintain a healthy lifestyle, just know you are not alone. Let’s make a pledge to stop eating monochromatic meals of brown and yellow starches and incorporate some color on to our plate. It won’t happen overnight. But I’ll be damned if one more person shames me for eating a cheesy gordita crunch for lunch again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4151f2529abc246117c71f1dc4e4c99470becfa5/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ba80f99d91ffb4d38f843790d81e3e9","title":"costa rica coach gustavo matosas resigns bored","story":"The Costa Rica coach, Gustavo Matosas, has resigned after less than a year in the job, blaming the frequent down times between games.“I realised that in the national side I feel unproductive even though I kill myself watching videos,” Matosas said at a press conference on Wednesday. “It’s not what I like to be doing.”The 52-year-old also admitted that he found the job boring. “It’s tough not having players in the day-to-day to train them.

For example, the top five lithium companies have all had human rights abuse allegations made against them, yet only one company had a publicly available policy on human rights, BHRRC found.BHRRC’s deputy director, Marti Flacks, said that in many of the countries where minerals are mined, weak regulation, poor enforcement and lack of rule of law have meant many companies have escaped scrutiny.“Renewable companies need to do their due diligence no matter where they’re working. This is not just about one country or one mineral,” said Flacks.“The companies that develop these six minerals are by and large more medium-sized mining companies, which don’t have as extensive due diligence or human rights policies in place, nor have they faced the same kind of exposure the larger companies have had, which means they haven’t been subject to the same kind of scrutiny.“But the renewable energy sector is growing really fast and it has a chance to change the standards and practices of the industry. This is a unique chance to send the sector a message to say: ‘You have to do your due diligence, you have to have a human rights policy and you have to be engaging in multi-stakeholder initiatives, doing site visits, and most importantly talking to communities and NGOs to get accurate reporting of what’s going on.’”Copper, which is integral to wind turbines and solar panels, had the second highest number of human rights abuse allegations, said the report, with 22 allegations of human rights abuses, including harm to access to water and land rights, recorded in Zambia between 2010 and 2019.The BHRRC has launched a tracker tool to allow investors, businesses and civil society groups to trace the allegations made against companies mining the six key minerals for the electric car, solar and wind sectors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d6d83db3f4027fb0b46ad276404d988154533f/0_325_4875_2925/master/4875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c80e218793993e07cdad554d223c696d","title":"from delhi street child to acclaimed photographer vicky roy in pictures","story":"Vicky Roy has gone from surviving in a railway station on food scrounged from a train to an award-winning career in photography.

In addition to official reviews, there are online listings for another 40,000 pubs across the UK.UK pubs are still closing at a rate of 14 a week, but the 2020 guide says the 2007 ban – which initially caused howls of public protest, “with licensees fearing a damaging drop in business as smokers deserted their local boozers” – has been transformational.“Those bars full of fug and male chat quickly became a thing of the past,” the guide notes. “Pubs adapted by installing smokers’ shelters and outdoor heaters, and licensees soon realised that by making their pubs smoke-free, they turned into cleaner, brighter places, and opened up a massive new customer base: women and families with young children who headed to pubs for a meal and even an overnight stay.”The editor, Fiona Stapley, said: “It is clear that this national institution has transformed itself from the 1970s, when pubs were smoky and grimy, the domain of beer-swilling men and only serving scampi and chips (if you were lucky), to the modern-day environment that is family and female friendly, serving excellent wines, craft gins and truly delicious home-cooked food.”Stapley singled out the Cottage of Content in Carey, Herefordshire, as a pub which before the smoking ban had offered average food and no bedrooms, with children admitted at the landlord’s discretion.But since the ban and under the landlord, John Clift, the beamed cottage now gives families and children a warm welcome. The food is cooked by Clift and overnighters can enjoy quiet bedrooms and first-class breakfasts.Crowned gin pub of the year for the second year running is the Cholmondeley Arms in Cheshire – nicknamed the Chum – which boasts a collection of 400-plus gins.The guide’s annual survey of drinks prices also reveals the average price of a pint of beer in Britain is £3.79, up 10p from last year. There is a £1.11-a-pint difference between the cheapest area – Shropshire at £3.46 – and the most expensive, London at an eye-watering £4.57."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a21bb6e549df157554edd5b005ec7a87182741/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0d3f4ad58bce3a1ce818baa1b8202a7","title":"softboi what is it instagram q and a","story":"They have alternative interests and come across as very open with their emotions, but there’s a dark side“I don’t deal in base desires such as social media. I pursue beautiful women and even more beautiful poetry.”“I feel like I’ve dreamt of you in colors that don’t exist.”“My parents live in Hoxton. But I live in the moment.”If you’ve ever sent or received a message similar to this, you may already know what a softboi is. If not, you’re probably thinking it’s a meaningless new dating term I’ve just made up (after all, I’ve done it before). But you’d be wrong.To learn more – and see just how extensive the trend is – the Instagram page Beam Me Up Soft Boi is the best available resource. It has amassed more than 200,000 followers since being set up last year to document softbois, and receives up to 300 submissions a day. I spoke to Iona, who runs the account and recently wrote an A to Z guide to softbois, to get to the bottom of it.Hi Iona. For anyone unfamiliar with the term, what is a softboi?There’s a softboi spectrum. At one end, it’s just anyone who has any unique or alternative interests that make them feel superior to other people. At the other end is quite hardcore emotionally manipulative men who use these interests to really mess about with women or men. But there’s so many people in between on the spectrum so there’s no one real definition.What are three terms you’d use to describe a softboi?You can assign those qualities to a lot of people, but you’re saying it’s the alternativeness that gives the bois their soft edge?Yeah, exactly. Softbois have alternative interests and come across like they’re being very open about their emotions, which is a really good thing for men to do. But it then twists into “and you should therefore sleep with me because of this”.But still, how do you tell the difference between a softboi and someone who is in touch with their feelings, and genuinely into “non-mainstream” things?The difference between the softboi and a decent guy who’s in touch with his emotions – and may just have a passing interest in Lou Reed – is that the softboi would try to lord his nicheness over people. They have blind faith that the people they want to impress will fall at their feet simply because they’re different, and if they don’t he will likely throw his toys out of the pram.What’s the best example of a softboi that you’ve been sent?This is the most softboi series of messages I have ever seen.He says he’s an outsider, which is straightaway a softboi move. But he doesn’t enjoy Shrek because there are much better films. That’s obvious, isn’t it? And then “please tell me you’ve watched Pulp Fiction” is just the greatest sentence ever.Is there a female equivalent to a softboi?There’s definitely such a thing as a softgirl, and people always tell me to set up an account for them, but I’m not sure it would be as funny. If someone sent me a really funny screenshot from a girl I’d post it and say it’s a girl. That’s why I spelt it boi not boy, because it can be fluid. But also, a soft girl already sort of exists in the form of a manic pixie dream girl.Hypothetically speaking, if I was now terrified that I’m a softboi, how would I know? Is there a checklist I can look at to find out?– Do you have the name of a band in your dating app bio?– Have you had a pair of Vans or Dr Martens that you’ve treated like children and tell everyone how you’ve had them for years?– Do you exclusively shop at Urban Outfitters?– Do you find yourself ranting about how terrible your life is to someone you’re trying to pursue and saying “but you can help me feel better”?– Have you ever asked someone back to your flat under the premise of taking “artistic” photos with your 35mm?– Is your ideal woman a manic pixie dream girl?– Do you romanticise drug use? (“Can we sniff lines and watch The Notebook?” is a real message featured by the account)What’s your advice to someone dating a softboi?Think: is it worth it? You know, if he keeps bringing up Thom Yorke while you’re trying to have sex. There are plenty of boys who aren’t softbois who you can go for but, that said, there are also plenty of softbois who are harmless and really great, so don’t worry too much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cdb5a17af8ebc36707353571d582e2f9db31640/0_690_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ac31ae655f10f6456523eaa481e0c4","title":"iggy pop free review","story":"(Caroline International)This strange patchwork of jazz, poetry, ambience, lamentable lyrics and the odd pub-singer moment works fitfully at bestIn 2007, in the middle of the re-formed Stooges’ chaotic Glastonbury performance, Iggy Pop suddenly struck up with an a cappella rendition of 1965 movie theme The Shadow of Your Smile. This clearly wasn’t something the audience were expecting: No Fun, yes I Wanna Be Your Dog, of course an easy listening ballad made famous by Johnny Mathis and subsequently covered by Engelbert Humperdinck, not so much. But it wasn’t an isolated incident: throughout the Stooges’ career, Pop showed a propensity for launching into The Shadow of Your Smile at unlikely moments. He sang it in 1972, for CBS Records boss Clive Davis, in the hope of convincing him to sign the Stooges at a point in their career when the band had been written off as a joke: a move that paid off. Later that year, he sang it during the Stooges’ mythic performance at London’s Scala cinema, to an audience who were largely bemused or horrified by what was happening on stage. There are muddy bootleg recordings of him singing it at whatever godforsaken venues the Stooges were reduced to playing in 1974, during the original band’s harrowing terminal phase. Pop, it seems, has always been keen to demonstrate that, amid the chaos and bloodshed and visceral rock’n’roll on which his reputation is based, he’s a man of many, perhaps improbable, parts.This is worth remembering when trying to make sense of his recent solo releases. The Stooges’ re-formation – and their failure to translate the force of their live shows into a potent studio album – seemed to have largely rid him of the desire to make loud, aggressive rock music. Supposedly his last album, 2016’s Post Pop Depression instead looked to the arty angularity of his 70s Bowie collaborations for inspiration. Elsewhere, the Pop of The Shadow of Your Smile has been very much in evidence: 2009’s Préliminaires saw him crooning Autumn Leaves and flirting with trad jazz 2012’s Après featured the mind-blowing sound of Pop essaying the Beatles’ Michelle.But perhaps not even that could prepare you for Free, on which Pop collaborates with jazz trumpeter Leron Thomas and shoegaze-inspired guitarist Noveller, recites poetry – by Lou Reed and Dylan Thomas – over new-agey piano and ambient synth textures and occasionally sounds less like one of rock history’s greatest frontmen than a special guest, a man with a cameo role on his own album. His contribution to the title track consists of him saying “I wanna be free”, twice. The nearest comparison from his back catalogue might be the spoken-word-heavy Avenue B, unveiled to minimal sales and critical raspberries 20 years ago. But even the ardent Pop-timist who’s sat through that might find that certain moments on Free cause them to hit the panic button, not least when Pop augments his The Shadow of Your Smile baritone with a pub-singer vibrato so pronounced and arch that, at one point during Page, it causes him to stretch the word “all” out over nine syllables.There are undoubtedly moments where the collaboration sparks. Love’s Missing is taut, gripping and not unlike the Pixies, had the Pixies opted to expand their lineup with a jazz trumpeter. Sonali, by contrast, sounds like something from the early 80s: wafty electronics, ringing guitar harmonics, surprisingly rapid-fire drumming. It’s a curious place for Iggy Pop to fetch up, but, as we’ve already established, a certain expectation-confounding streak has always been in evidence.Sonali also features the sound of Pop audibly struggling to fit the lyrics to the music. In fact, lyrics are a bit of a problem throughout. Pop has been keen to point out that Thomas and Noveller wrote the album, and it’s tempting to say you can see why. There’s clearly nothing wrong with Dylan Thomas’s Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night or indeed Lou Reed’s We Are the People, which hails from 1970, but sounds like an excoriation of Trump’s America. Occasionally, however, Pop seems to have accepted the challenge to sing something even more embarrassing than the lyrics of DD’s, the re-formed Stooges’ 2013 paean to large breasts. On Dirty Sanchez, someone has had the brainwave of using breasts and penises as a metaphor for the inequities of capitalism: “Just because I like big tits doesn’t mean I like big dicks, rich man make it stop – we don’t all want the cock”.It all ends after barely 30 minutes with The Dawn: more dramatic ambient tones, more spoken word, this time delivered in a menacing growl. “To lay down is to just give up,” Pop says, which perhaps offers some explanation for the preceding half-hour of poetry, weird vocal experiments, excruciating lyrics and occasional flashes of inspiration. Around the time of Post Pop Depression, he started talking of retiring: the ensuing documentary, American Valhalla, didn’t shy away from showing the physical toll being Iggy Pop on stage takes on a septuagenarian. Like adding vocals to Underworld’s music on last year’s EP Teatime Dub Encounters, Free offers him a way to continue, to demonstrate that he’s still a man of many, perhaps improbable, parts without unduly exerting himself. You can’t really blame him, although you do wish he’d exerted himself a little when it came to quality control: it’s an experiment that only fitfully works, that makes you eager for his next album largely because this really doesn’t feel like the right way for Iggy Pop to bow out.Jay Som: CrownHazy but expansive alt-rock from Los Angeles one-woman band Melina Mae Duterte, perfectly timed for the end of summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d047228f36cfa9dab23b1ee6e8b91a6b33fb430a/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=235487267fee9f640498b8b9239ed869","title":"back to school after a decade of austerity podcast","story":"As the chancellor, Sajid Javid, gears up for what could be a pre-election spending review, education correspondent Sally Weale tells Anushka Asthana how nearly 10 years of government cutbacks in school funding have fed through to the classroom.

We will build a global Britain where we will walk tall,” he said.During the statement, Javid was interrupted twice by the Speaker, John Bercow, and ordered to limit his speech to the spending review after the chancellor devoted the early parts of his appearance to attacking Labour’s policy on Brexit. But Javid quickly came under fire from Labour for exaggerating the impact of spending increases after nine years of budget cuts. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “The government seems to be spending the money they said was needed to cope with a no-deal Brexit. This is just another stunt and doesn’t in any way show the government is involved in long-term planning.”The Institute for Public Policy Research accused the government of using a “mirage of figures” that would fail to reverse austerity. The left-leaning thinktank said: “The public shouldn’t be taken in by today’s spending review. It does not reverse a decade of austerity and chronic underinvestment in our society and economy.”The tax and spending thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that once health was excluded from the calculation, the extra funds barely reversed a quarter of the cuts to spending departments since 2010.The IFS director, Paul Johnson, also accused the chancellor of making commitments using out-of-date economic forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent forecaster, that dated back to the spring and which had since worsened.He said: “By making major spending decisions without having the most up-to-date forecasts for the economy and public finances, the chancellor is taking a gamble. As it stands, there looks to be a very real risk of having to choose between tax increases or missing his current fiscal targets come the budget later this year– even with a smooth departure from the EU.”Javid said a combination of a £11.7bn increase in inflation-adjusted day-to-day spending and a £1.7bn rise in capital spending would push up public budgets next year by £13.4bn. If some 2019-20 funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit is included, it shows that the government is planning to increase day-to-day budgets across the two financial years by £13.8bn. The spending increase in percentage terms is the biggest since 2003-04. He said the government would set aside £2bn in addition to the £6bn already allocated for preparations related to leaving the EU without a deal. There will be an extra £6.2bn next year for day-to-day spending on the NHS.Briefing journalists after the chancellor’s statement, Treasury officials insisted that the spending round had been carried out within the government’s fiscal limits. “This spending round is delivered in line with our existing fiscal rules, and the existing forecast from the OBR. We said we would do that, and we have delivered that. In the coming months, we will review the fiscal framework, ahead of the budget.”An official pointed out that at Philip Hammond’s final budget earlier this year, he set aside “headroom” of £27bn against the rules, and the uplift in spending set out by Javid was £13.8bn.However, £12bn of student loans must be included in government borrowing from this month, and Hammond made clear that the cushion would be more than used up in the event of a no-deal Brexit – which Boris Johnson insists remains an option – on 31 October.Hammond said in June that he had “no doubt whatsoever” that all of that money and more would be needed to respond to the immediate impacts of the disruption caused by a no-deal exit. “And that will mean that there is no money available for longer-term either tax cuts or spending increases,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013e53a44f799ddbca19d592503e5ff83a690c5c/0_6_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cff055a141a4f995312d19e9fa606ca5","title":"luciana berger joins liberal democrats brexit remain","story":"Remain campaigner says party is only one that is unequivocal in wanting to stop BrexitThe former Labour politician Luciana Berger has joined the Liberal Democrats, becoming the second MP to join the party in a week.The MP for Liverpool Wavertree and remain campaigner said the party is the only one that has proven to be “unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit”.In February she quit Labour over the party’s handling of antisemitism cases and its approach to Brexit alongside six other MPs to form fledging political grouping Change UK.

Despite the recent pick-up in earnings, it said workers were still facing the longest pay squeeze for 200 years.O’Grady said: “We’re at risk of going back to 19th-century working conditions. Millions of workers have no control and no voice at work, with increasing numbers stuck on low pay, zero-hours contracts, and in sham self-employment.“We urgently need to reset the balance of power in our economy and give people more of a say about what happens to them at work. We know that collective bargaining is the best way to raise wages and improve conditions – so let’s expand it across the whole workforce.”The TUC says that increasing the number of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements was the best way to raise wages and improve conditions. In addition to a £10-an-hour minimum wage and a ban on zero-hours contracts, the TUC is seeking:TUC research has found that low wages are linked to unsecured borrowing hitting record levels, with one in five families stuck in problem debt. Unsecured debt per household stood at £15,880 in the first quarter of 2019, up £1,160 on a year earlier.O’Grady said Britain needed to have a debt reality check. “We need to rebuild family finances or we are stuffed. This has always been the canary in the mine.“This is not about people splashing the cash. It is about paying for the basics. It is about wages still not back to where they were before the crash and prices in the shops going up.”The TUC general secretary said that a hard Brexit would hit poor people first and hardest.“Michael Gove is talking about bumps along the road but they will be earthquakes for those drowning in debt who haven’t got a magic money tree at the bottom of the garden.”O’Grady said that many of those who voted leave in the referendum did so because of frustration about low wages, insecurity and zero-hour contracts and “uber-globalisation”, which had seen “a shift in power and wealth to a tiny minority at the top while everybody else had to do with the crumbs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5645aef0f35dc3721bc3c8a8d431dafc142cbc8/0_178_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72db51359a86485d1a8c4de5cbff74fd","title":"parliament returns for brexit showdown today in focus podcast","story":"Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss a pivotal week ahead in British politics.

It’s quite a fall from grace. If I was Devin I would be feeling very sorry for myself and wondering whether it was justified.”Toner missed the final four rounds of this year’s Six Nations after suffering an ankle injury in the opener and the player who was preferred to him, Jean Kleyn, qualified for Ireland on residency grounds only this summer. The South Africa-born player was part of the lineout that malfunctioned against England last month, but he is seen as offering more in the loose.Owen Franks, meanwhile, was looking forward to his third World Cup. The prop has been a mainstay of the All Blacks’ pack for most of this decade and started two of their three Rugby Championship matches this summer, but he lost out to two younger, far less experienced players with speed around the field cited as a reason. Franks issued a statement denying that he was slowing down while admitting the two tight-heads chosen were quicker than him.This is part of a trend. At 27 the Wales loosehead prop Rob Evans is not in the veteran category but after starting four of Wales’s matches in their grand slam triumph this year he suffered injuries that disrupted his World Cup preparations. He was considered to be lacking the durability needed in Japan and Warren Gatland chose the 21-year-old Rhys Carré, whose number of caps equals his number of starts in the Pro14, one, for the World Cup.The England head coach, Eddie Jones, did not have to make a decision over Dylan Hartley, who was not considered because of injury, but by making Owen Farrell co-captain last year and giving him the responsibility of overturning an interval deficit against Japan, he was already leaning that way.When Wales returned from their tour to New Zealand in 2016, the national management called a meeting with the four regional coaches and said they wanted tight five forwards to be far better equipped when it came to running, handling and passing. They recognised that the game was evolving and that set-pieces, while still important, were influencing fewer outcomes.The Bristol back-row Aly Muldowney, in an interview with the Irish website Balls.ie, reflected on Toner’s omission. “The demands on second-rows are increasing and increasing,” he said. “They have to be near level with back-rows who don’t have to scrummage as hard. Now you have to be way more involved in the game and the same goes for front-rows. Otherwise you just get found out these days when everyone else is so fit.”A breakdown of the squads for the World Cup showed that the tier two and three nations had a greater number of 30-something players than the tier one sides, an average of 11 compared with 8.2. Of the leading sides Wales chose seven and England a mere four, including both their scrum-halves.It was not that long ago that Eddie Jones looked geared to take players such as Mike Brown, Ben Te’o, Danny Care, Chris Robshaw and James Haskell to Japan. They all featured in England’s final match of the 2018 Six Nations, a day when eight of the 23 had reached 30. Jones’s training sessions are high on intensity, with players tracked. He never reveals why someone has been omitted, no matter his contribution in the past like Gatland, he relies on evidence, of his own eyes and statistical.If age is a factor, it is not the only one. One of the difficulties of selecting a Lions squad is anticipating how players who start for their countries will cope with the disappointment of being on the bench for a Test or, worse, stuck in the stand wearing a shirt and tie.Would a player chosen for the World Cup who had been a first-choice for so long show as much enthusiasm and drive in training when he realised he was likely to start against only the lowest-ranked side in the group as a rookie whose surprise at being included in the squad was as great as his delight? Carré might not start a match in Japan but he will bring a desire and energy to training. Which is not to say Evans would have sulked but it is hard to mask frustration for nigh on two months.Gatland, Jones and Schmidt have not got where they are by ducking tough decisions the same with New Zealand’s Steve Hansen. As former players, they know the stabbing pain of rejection. As coaches, they have to put the team first and not get washed away by sentiment.International rugby is becoming a younger player’s game, no matter how much such as Alun Wyn Jones and Sergio Parisse resist the march of time. Yes, there is something distasteful about a player just qualifying on residency grounds nudging out an established member of the squad but, if Schmidt brings the World Cup to Ireland, who will mention it?• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Will the Patriots repeat? Will the Raiders implode? And what can Patrick Mahomes possibly do for an encore?Nicky Bandini … hating on pass interference. Making PI calls (or non-calls) reviewable is one of those decisions that makes sense on paper but subjecting this area of the game to greater scrutiny will – a bit like VAR in soccer – make us realize everything we don’t like about the rules as they are currently written.Gabriel Baumgaertner … Jets quarterback Sam Darnold. The second-year passer will finish in the top five of MVP voting and instantly become the best quarterback in franchise history once New York fans realize that Joe Namath was overrated.Oliver Connolly … the little brothers. The Browns. The Lions. The Jets. The downtrodden and oft-scoffed at franchises will fight back against the stalwarts: The Bears, Steelers and Patriots (kind of).Hunter Felt … more players taking themselves out of the game for health reasons. Andrew Luck’s shocking departure will act as the tone-setter for this season: NFL players are well-aware of the long-term health effects involved with playing football and know that a single injury can ruin their lives.Melissa Jacobs … widespread inventive offense. With Sean McVay friend and disciples Zac Taylor, Mike LaFleur and Kliff Kingsbury stampeding the head-coaching ranks, not to mention Kyle Shanahan with a healthy arsenal, creative scheming should be the norm.NB The LA Chargers. Melvin Gordon is still holding out, Russell Okung’s return date is uncertain as he recovers from a pulmonary embolism and Derwin James is on injured reserve. Or, to put it another way, Los Angeles are down their starting running back, best offensive tackle and an All-Pro safety. GB The Chicago Bears may have the league’s best defense, but their league-leading 27 interceptions were a statistical outlier that is unlikely to repeat. Not even an elite defense will overcome the inconsistency of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and the team’s woeful kicking situation.OC The Indianapolis Colts. Indy have everything … except for Andrew Luck. Jacoby Brissett will do enough to carry a loaded team close to the playoffs, but they’ll just fall short.HF The Baltimore Ravens. The AFC North is going to be brutal. The Cleveland Browns have a genuine shot at winning the ision (don’t laugh) and the Pittsburgh Steelers are always in the playoff mix. This could leave the Ravens on the outside looking in, although none of that will be the fault of starting quarterback Lamar Jackson, who should improve as a passer in his sophomore campaign.MJ The San Francisco 49ers. Regular season Jimmy Garoppolo will look much better than preseason Jimmy G. Close but not quite playoff material yet.NB The Browns. Obvious, perhaps, but I’ll back Cleveland to end their 16-year postseason drought.GB The Jets. There are legitimate concerns about a team with a new head coach (Adam Gase) and one that fired their general manager in May. Fortunately, New York have a budding star in second-year quarterback Sam Darnold. He will be a top-five QB by season’s end with new weapons in running back Le’Veon Bell and wide receiver Jamison Crowder. Add linebacker CJ Mosley to one of the league’s top defenses and the Jets should nab one of the two AFC wild card spots.OC The Browns are the obvious answer. The talent on both sides of the ball, at all three levels, is ludicrous. One tidbit to monitor: Cleveland’s line is below average, even in an era of stinky offensive line play. HF The Browns. After a standout season from Baker Mayfield, Cleveland made the decision to trade for wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr to boost their offense. MJ The Packers. Matt LaFleur should add enough spice to the playbook and the Aaron Rodgers-Davante Adams combo should be enough to return to the postseason.NB Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson will lead the league in rushing touchdowns.GB The Dolphins won’t be the league’s worst team. The Cardinals, winners of three games in 2018, will regress in 2019 and win fewer games than rebuilding Miami.OC Ben Roethlisberger is benched. Look at the advanced analytics, and Big Ben was the league average in 2018. Any stat you want to go to, the Pittsburgh quarterback was between 15th and 18th in the league: accuracy, throwing under pressure, depth of target, on and on and on. He was fine, but not his usual self. The decline is already underway. The collapse will come sooner than most think.HF Given the myriad issues in the league (from non-guaranteed contracts to the long-term health impacts of the sport), it wouldn’t be shocking if we hear rumbling about the first players’ strike since 1987.MJ Tom Brady’s physical tools will finally regress to the point of being a liability. The Pats will still be in the Super Bowl but Brady will have a difficult decision to make about his future.NB Helmet sagas, frostbitten feet, fish-head-in-the-fridge lawsuits … is Antonio Brown in Oakland a disaster waiting to happen or one that’s already unfolding?GB Arizona’s Kyler Murray is an extremely talented quarterback who would thrive with a few games of study under a seasoned NFL quarterback. Instead, he’ll be the Week 1 starter under rookie head coach Kliff Kingsbury, who compiled a 35-40 record as a college head coach and whose defenses finished 105th or lower for five consecutive seasons before his dismissal. Murray is a great player entering a horrendous situation.OC The Raiders. OK, so in one building we have: Antonio Brown, Jon Gruden, Mike Mayock, Richie Incognito, Vontaze Burfict, Mark Davis and the looming specter of a move to Vegas. Woof! Not even Derek Carr’s blandness can save this inevitable calamity.HF The Miami Dolphins are desperately trying to tank, but what if starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has the tendency to play fantastic when nobody expects anything from him and incredibly badly when handed the keys, backfires and they win enough games to sink their draft position? MJ Beware more bizarre antics from Antonio Brown, especially once the Raiders start racking up losses. Trash-talking teammates and coaches, running off to Botswana, worshipping the color blue. With AB expect abnormal to be the norm.NB … not going to make anyone forget how the league treated Colin Kaepernick.GB … further proof that Jay-Z is not just a businessman, he’s a business, man! Whatever his aims are, it’s a staggering decision to align himself with NFL owners.OC … a sham. Progress to profit, this was always going to be the way. Jay-Z sold out Colin Kaepernick and his fellow, peaceful protestors. The NFL got what it wanted: Kaepernick is out of the league, other players are now on notice, and they’re able to make cash. It’s disgusting.HF … incredibly devious. It’s a brilliant marketing move that papers over a lot of ugliness in the league and the more I think about it, the more depressed I get.MJ … a strange branding move for Jay-Z that may help a few people but will never detract from the league’s role in Colin Kaepernick’s unemployment.NB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. It’s reasonable to expect some regression, but the conditions are all there for him to thrive again in Andy Reid’s offense.GB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. He’ll become the first repeat winner of the league’s highest inidual honor since Peyton Manning in 2008 and 2009.OC Aaron Rodgers, Packers. Either a new staff revitalizes the most talented player (second now?) at the most valuable position in sports, or he’s become some kind of uncoachable inidualist who cannot work within a team construct, regardless of its construct. I’m betting on the former he’s going to wreck the league.HF Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. His biggest obstacles? Well, there’s the looming presence of Drew Brees, particularly if the Chiefs end with a worse record than the Saints, and the general difficulty of remaining fully healthy year in and year out in the NFL. Still, I believe.MJ Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. As long as Mahomes is in the same stratosphere as last season’s 50-touchdown extravaganza, this is his award to lose in 2019 and beyond.NB Josh Allen, Jaguars. There are two Josh Allens to keep an eye on in the NFL this season, but only one of them is a rookie pass rusher who I’m expecting to light things up on a Jacksonville defense that could bounce back strongly in 2019.GB David Montgomery, Bears. The rookie running back from Iowa State will be thrust into head coach Matt Nagy’s offense. He’s a gifted pass-catching back and will be a necessary weapon for a quarterback as inconsistent as Trubisky.OC Mecole Hardman, Chiefs. Hardman might be the springiest athlete in the league. He was drafted to replace Tyreek Hill. Now, he’ll play alongside him. If Hardman has four “Wow” highlights, he’ll clinch the award.HF Josh Jacobs, Raiders. No 1 overall pick Kyler Murray is probably the favorite to win this one, but there are always questions when it comes to a rookie quarterback. It’s possible we’ll see Jacobs put up some monster numbers with the Raiders while Murray takes his lumps. His new boss seems to believe that will happen.MJ Kyler Murray, Cardinals. Murray’s talent and Kliff Kingsbury’s playbook should help the rookie compile an undeniable highlight reel, thus securing an award that almost always goes to an offensive player.NB The Patriots, because of course.GB The Patriots last finished a season with fewer than double-digit wins was in 2002. OC The Patriots. Duh. Messrs Belichick, Brady, Scarnecchia and McDaniels are there. If those four are in or around the building, they win the AFC East. It’s that simple.HF With Brady on the decline, and Rob Gronkowski retired, expect New England to take a step backward yet still clinch the ision with ease.MJ The Patriots. The easiest ision to call for a decade now. The Jets and Bills should improve but will be second-class citizens until Bill Belichick retires.NB The Browns. Ah, go on then, let’s buy all the way into Cleveland hype. This is a fascinating ision, though – I believe in John Harbaugh’s ability to make the most of Lamar Jackson’s skillset and Mark Ingram is an upgrade at running back, too. If the Steelers can stay competitive, as usual, it’s going to be a close fight.GB The Ravens. Second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson is ready for a star turn, and the Baltimore offense will wear down opposing defenses with exhausting drives while their defense will provide its trademark tenacity.OC The Browns. If Cleveland wore different helmets, they would be co-favorites to win the Super Bowl alongside the defending champs.HF The Browns. This is saying something, since the Browns haven’t won a ision title since 1989 and haven’t made the playoffs since 2002. The Cavaliers won an NBA title and the Indians won the pennant back in 2016. It’s the Browns’ time. MJ The Ravens. Cleveland are the sexy pick but Lamar Jackson’s progression and an elite secondary will help Baltimore prevail in a tight ision.NB The Jaguars. So many questions for all of these teams. Can DeShaun Watson survive without an offensive line in Houston? Will Marcus Mariota ever become the star he was billed to be? Is there any hope for the Colts without Luck? I’m not convinced that Nick Foles is going to be brilliant in Jacksonville, but he will be better than Blake Bortles, and that might be enough to vault the Jags to the top of the pile.GB The Colts. Even with Andrew Luck’s shocking retirement, Indianapolis will start one of the league’s more reliable backups in Jacoby Brissett while returning one of the game’s best defensive players in Darius Leonard, a stacked offensive line and an extremely creative offensive mind in head coach Frank Reich. OC The Titans. I don’t feel good about it, but it feels like they’ve leapfrogged the Colts and Texans in the last fortnight.HF The Texans. With Luck out of the picture, Houston are going all-in, particularly with the trade for tackle Laremy Tunsil, although possibly sacrificing their long-term success in the process. Watch as the Texans win the ision by default, potentially with a .500 record, lose in their first game of the playoffs and suffer buyer’s remorse for the next few seasons.MJ The Jaguars. Jacksonville retained most of their key defensive starters and should again be a top-five unit. Nick Foles is a major upgrade over Blake Bortles.NB The Chiefs. Did I mention how much I’m looking forward to watching Mahomes again?GB The Chargers. A toothless Chiefs defense means Los Angeles will shock the NFL and win the ision. The holdout of running back Melvin Gordon denies quarterback Philip Rivers of one of his better weapons, but backup Austin Ekeler is a versatile piece and complements a host of talented playmakers between receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams as well as tight end Hunter Henry. Defensive ends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, arguably the league’s most underrated defender, will terrorize opposing quarterbacks.OC The Chargers. They finished eighth in defensive DVOA last year and third in offensive DVOA. And they improved on both sides of the ball.HF The Chiefs. Here’s where my Most Valuable Player pick has essentially made my choice for me. If Mahomes ends up being the regular-season MVP for a second straight season, that would probably necessitate him leading the Chiefs to their second straight AFC West title. The Chargers are going to make things interesting though.MJ The Chiefs. With Mahomes, Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, Kansas City have too much firepower. The Chargers are close but losing disruptive safety Derwin James really stings.NB The Eagles. If Carson Wentz can stay healthy, Philadelphia are a Super Bowl contender. That’s a big if. Wentz made changes to his diet and workout schedule this offseason but his offensive line has been missing its entire right side in preseason. I’m still taking Philly, and have high hopes for rookie running back Miles Sanders, but so much rests on the quarterback’s ability to stay on the field.GB The Eagles. Philadelphia’s offensive line has combined to start 378 games as members of the Eagles, an astonishing feat of consistency that should help protect oft-injured quarterback Carson Wentz. On defense, linebacker Zach Brown was one of the best under-the-radar signings of the offseason. OC The Eagles. Pull up Philadelphia’s roster and try to find a hole. They are pretty much two-deep with league average talent at every single position. HF The Eagles. Bonus prediction: Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz will be the Comeback Player of the Year. MJ The Cowboys. With Zeke back and Kellen Moore calling plays, plus a fierce pair of inside linebackers, Dallas should hold off the feisty Eagles and claim the ision.NB The Vikings. Are we really sure Mitch Trubisky is going to take that big step forward in Chicago? The Packers have made significant upgrades to their pass rush and still have Aaron Rodgers behind center. But I’m taking Minnesota, who have an elite defense as well as brilliant offensive weapons in Dalvin Cook, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. Kirk Cousins has his limitations, but I trust him more than Trubisky.GB The Vikings. Kirk Cousins disappointed during his first season in Minnesota, but another year with receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs plus a reliable defense will help the Vikings outlast the Bears and Packers in one of the league’s toughest isions.OC The Packers. I’ve picked Aaron Rodgers to win the MVP, so I’ll give the ision nod to Green Bay. I still think the Lions go deeper in the playoffs, though.HF The Packers. It will be up for Aaron Rodgers to prove that he’s not done but a change in head coach might be just what he needs. The Bears’ ravenous defense should be enough to push them into the postseason, however.MJ The Bears. Chicago’s ridiculously stacked defense should give all NFL offenses nightmares. Also, Mitchell Trubisky is not the liability many think.NB The Falcons. I’m worried about Cam Newton’s shoulder. I also think that we may see a little regression from Drew Brees at 40 years old. Atlanta drafted to strengthen their offensive line but should be better in any case simply by virtue of having Keanu Neal, Ricardo Allen and Deion Jones – three key starters – back on defense after losing all three to injury early last year.GB The Saints. For years, New Orleans soared on offense while fielding some of the league’s worst defenses. The presence of defensive lineman Cameron Jordan and one of the game’s best secondaries has transformed the Saints into a complete unit that is equipped to make a deep playoff run.OC The Panthers. If Cam Newton’s shoulder holds up, Carolina are as gifted as any team in the ision.HF New Orleans were defeated in overtime by the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC championship game after the referees missed an easy pass interference call that would have put them in position to win in regulation. This will be their revenge season.MJ The Saints. New Orleans went 13-3 last season and probably should have been in the Super Bowl. They only got better in the offseason. No reason they shouldn’t dominate the ision again.NB The Rams have their problems, and it’s possible that opponents have learned a thing or two about how to stop them from watching Super Bowl LIII. But this ision is still theirs to lose.GB The Rams. Sean McVay enamored the world with his high-flying offense that anchored an unlikely Super Bowl berth. It’s improbable that quarterback Jared Goff will be quite as good in 2019, but the Rams remain the class of the ision.OC The Rams. We’re at the start of a long Sean McVay-Jared Goff run in the West. Don’t overthink it. Eric Weddle might be the most impactful pickup anywhere this offseason.HF The Rams. They still should be favorites to win the ision but watch out for the Seattle Seahawks, who should challenge them throughout the rest of the season.MJ The Rams. Forget the last Super Bowl. They still boast a super-team roster and a head coach who schemes in his sleep.NB Patriots over Eagles. Tom Brady continues to defy age and logic, exacting revenge on the Eagles team that defied him two years before. Brady, with nothing left to prove to anyone, confirms that he will be back to do it all again next year anyway.GB Saints over Ravens. In a thrilling clash of high-flying offense against punishing defense, Drew Brees finally overcomes the brutal playoff defeats that have ended the last two seasons in New Orleans before announcing his retirement. Lamar Jackson’s valiant comeback ends short of the go-ahead touchdown, but Jackson’s future brightens while one of the game’s most prolific passers retires on top.OC Eagles over Patriots. When you have a top-five offensive line and top-five pass-rush, you should be winning Super Bowls.HF Saints over Chiefs. I want to say Kansas City here, but the fact is the Chiefs defense continues to lag well behind their offense. That’s going to be a problem against Drew Brees and the Saints. In fact, if you’re a betting person, take the over on the points allowed by Kansas City in this prediction.MJ Bears over Patriots. With incredible defensive line depth that gives defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano many personnel options, the Bears are built to withstand the Pats’ various run schemes. Khalil Mack, Eddie Jackson and company will be able to disrupt Tom Brady just like the Rams did last season, Chicago will showcase their dynamic run attack and a signal-caller in Trubisky who people forget was a stud in the second half of the doink-y loss to Philly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236c2881f2aab4a6736b0e17c8dda8e07f353b2d/0_602_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ef7bc6353b34dfa1cdcb6d1bfb06460","title":"rafael nadal us open quarter final","story":"Rafael Nadal overcame a spirited challenge from Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman to win 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in the US Open quarter-finals on Wednesday night at Arthur Ashe Stadium, staying on course for a fourth title at Flushing Meadows and 19th major championship to move within one of Roger Federer’s all-time record.The second-seeded Spaniard squandered double-break leads in the first and second sets, but recovered to win each of them with exquisite shotmaking and his trademark steel before closing out the match after two hours and 47 minutes.“When he is under confidence he’s very difficult to stop,” Nadal said after reaching the semi-finals of a major tournament for the 33rd time. “Of course I made some mistakes, but I’m super happy the way I accepted the situation and I accepted the challenge. Here I am in the semi-finals. It’s super important to me. It means everything.”Nadal led 4-love in the opener before an abruptly wayward forehand enabled the 5ft 7in Argentine to level at 4-all, prompting chants of “olé, olé, olé” from the rollicking late-night crowd in Queens. It was the same for the second set, where a sudden glut of misfires from the forehand side allowed Schwartzman to push it to 5-all from 1-5 down.But the muscular Mallorcan, who pounded 35 winners and broke serve eight times, was able to clamp down on the critical points in each session to stake a commanding two-sets-to-none lead over the 27-year-old from Buenos Aires.The 33-year-old Nadal was visited early in the final set by the trainer, who spent the changeover rubbing cream into his left forearm. He spent the next several games flexing the other forearm on the baseline, but fears of cramping were quickly dispelled as he won the last four games on the trot to wrap up a competitive but straightforward third and book a spot in the last four, where he will be the betting favourite to add to his 2010, 2014 and 2017 titles at the season-ending major.“Physically I am fine,” said Nadal, who has reached the semi-finals of all four majors in the same year for the second time in his career and first since 2008. “Today was a very heavy day. Big humidity. I am this kind of player where I sweat a bit. Sometimes under these conditions it’s tough, but honestly I am happy that I had some critical moments at the end of the second and the beginning of the third.”After both Federer and top-seeded Novak Djokovic were eliminated in upsets earlier in the week, Nadal’s win on a humid New York night ensured at least one of the sport’s Big Three would be represented in the semi-finals for a 62nd consecutive grand slam tournament.The world No 2 advances to a Friday meeting with 24th-seeded Matteo Berrettini, who outlasted Gael Monfils in a five-set thriller earlier on Wednesday to become the first Italian man to reach the US Open semi-finals since 1977. The winner of their match will face either fifth-seeded Daniil Medvedev or 78th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov in Sunday’s final.“Berrettini is having a great year,” Nadal said. “He’s in semi-finals, winning a lot of good matches, so what you can expect in a semi-finals of a grand slam match? You can’t expect an easy opponent. You can’t expect an easy match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801df545afd70ec956e7e5024c3e0a52fe3803de/626_122_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=278e4099473acc94cd9d224c10fe15a6","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fourth test day two live cricket","story":"61st over: Australia 224-5 (Smith 90, Paine 0) Well bowled Jack Leach, giving Wade the chance to dance as he had before the rain delay. A crafty bowler. As Ricky Ponting notes, Wade likes to score and wasn’t picking up runs with the ease he would have liked when defending the seamers from the Pavilion End. Wade dances at Leach but miscues badly, the top edge swirling high in the air, taken safely by the captain Root. After all that hard work.60th over: Australia 221-4 (Smith 87, Wade 16) There isn’t much going on from Overton’s end, Wade defending him. confidently.59th over: Australia 220-4 (Smith 87, Wade 16) A mix-up! Smith bunts and runs into the legside, Wade sending him back with a roar. Absolutely the right decision - there was no run there. That’s the advantage of having a senior player with Smith. He’s right back on it next ball, taking full advantage of a delivery on the leg stump from Leach, taking him through midwicket for four. Shot. Leach bounces straight back though, beating him on the outside edge with a delivery that really dips and grips. Smith acknowledges that it is a very good bit of bowling. Smith moves to 87 with one to cover. Some mythbusting about that number: when in the 80s, Australians have been dismissed more often on every score other than 87. 58th over: Australia 215-4 (Smith 82, Wade 16) Overton goes bouncer, bouncer to begin - a touch odd to use them both to start an over. Smith is across this, standing tall at the crease to flick the next ball to deep backward square for one. Wade blocks out the rest without concern. He’s 16 from 39 balls. The players are back on the field. No news on whether the playing times for the day have been adjusted - I suspect they will be. “Has Woakes been dropped or finally been rested from an undisclosed injury?” asks Ian James. Rested, is the word. But there’s also a whisper of a knee niggle. “I’ve been trying to figure out why he bowled so little at Lord’s and Headingley. Lord’s (we were told) was a utopian-type home ground for him and he barley got a look in. At Leeds, Stokes toiled away for over after over and no Woakes.” My best guess is the captain wanted Archer every moment he could at Lord’s and Stokes was doing a real shift at Leeds after Woakes battled on the first day. Either way, he’ll be back soon enough.Overton will bowl the first over back. Smith is on strike. Some emails? Let’s. From Matthew Doherty, to begin. “This Test is beginning to remind me of the one here in 1985,” he says. “Mike Gatting 160 Craig McDermott eight of the available wickets.”Did anyone else enjoy that 1980s Ashes doco during the rain on Sky Cricket yesterday? They do good work. “Here’s a deal,” suggests Edward Genochio, “call it It a cricketing version of baseball’s intentional walk. Smith doesn’t get to bat. We give him 100 runs (out) automatically in every innings, and we’ll just bowl at the rest of you. Putting the laws of cricket aside for the time being: would England make the offer? Would the Aussies accept?”I’ve been thinking a bit about Smith and his batting average. Could it finish... in the 70s? Since his breakthrough century at The Oval in August 2013, he goes at 73 across those 99 innings. Crazy. 57th over: Australia 214-4 (Smith 81, Wade 16) It’s very dark all of a sudden at Old Trafford, I am afraid to say. We’ll see. Fow now, it is Jack Leach for the first time today and there’s plenty going on right away, Wade nearly gloving a sweep to keep the fielders around the bat on their toes. The left-hander responds by dancing down the track, clipping with class through the air for a two-bounce four. Oh, it’s raining. And they’re off. Here come the covers. Urrrrrrgh. 56th over: Australia 209-4 (Smith 80, Wade 12) Huge appeal for caught behind! Archer seems certain that he has won Wade’s edge on the hook, landing in Bairstow’s gloves. Umpire Erasmus turns the shout down and rightly so: the replay confirms there’s nothing on it. Root keeps his cool and doesn’t review. Earlier, Wade brought up the Australian 200 with another well-controlled steer, past backward point and down to the rope. As Isa Guha says on telly, these two put on a 100-run stand at Edgbaston that put the First Test out of England’s reach. After the appeal the final ball is sprayed, clipping Wade’s pad and running away for four leg byes. Poor response.55th over: Australia 199-4 (Smith 79, Wade 8) Another probing Broad over - this is an excellent spell. Has he ever bowled better across a full series? But Wade is up to the task, getting on the front foot to push with control for a couple past cover then edging with soft hands on the bounce into the cordon. “Good luck for today’s play.” Thanks, James Wrout. “The photo at the top of the page has a caption at the moment which says “Steve Smith sweeps a beach ball at Old Trafford”. Surely it should say: “The game of cricket, as seen through the eyes of Steve Smith”!”I reckon Felix White summed it up best on twitter last night. 54th over: Australia 197-4 (Smith 79, Wade 6) Nice and calm, Wade gets through an accurate Archer over without any concern. He’ll be on strike for Broad next, advancing the score by one with a leg bye.53rd over: Australia 196-4 (Smith 79, Wade 6) Aside from the whack to the arm, Wade had looked pretty organised so far. It isn’t a stretch to say that this could be his final Test Match unless he makes a big contribution - he’s been around long enough to realise that. He gets off strike with a controlled push to point. Smith pulls a similar delivery to the one he left a couple of overs back, not at all middling it, but landing safely behind square for a couple. He ducks, defends and waves his wand when shouldering arms to complete the set. Might this be the day they leave Broad on for a really long spell?“Morning Collo.” Nick Toovey, my man. “Can’t help but view Steve Smith as somebody that’s now been conditioned by the Dog-Stick commonly used to hurl balls at batsman into a cricketing cocker iel. His excitement at having balls hurled towards him never wanes, and like any dog owner will testify, the people hurling the balls are getting bored, tired and cranky well before he does.”Talking to a member of the Australian camp a few weeks ago, he explained that Smith doesn’t mind batting three (as he does periodically) on the basis that an opener might get out first ball, which allows him to go in straight away. This is how his brain works. 52nd over: Australia 193-4 (Smith 77, Wade 5) Good batting from Smith, getting on the back foot early to Archer, able to steer him behind point for his third boundary of the morning. There are three bouncers either side of the stroke, all dealt with relatively easily by Smith. The extra yard he had at Lord’s isn’t quite there. Yet. 51st over: Australia 188-4 (Smith 73, Wade 4) Oooh, Broad is all over it here to Wade, drawing the left-hander forward from the around the wicket as he has done time and again in this series, beating the edge. As CricViz reported yesterday, he’s sent down 37 per cent of his deliveries on a full length in this series, more than ever before for him. Wade keeps his cool, glancing a ball from his middle stump to leave the last ball to Smith, leaving a bouncer he briefly considered having a flash at before realising it wasn’t a good idea.“Whilst we grapple with one particular batsman and how to dismiss him,” says Andrew Benzeval, “I note that over in Chittagong Rahmat Shah has scored Afghanistan’s maiden Test hundred. Well done that man.” Go you good thing go! He joins a pretty handy list. We interviewed the great Aminul ‘BulBul’ Islam during the World Cup for our 1999 retrospective project, the man who did it first for Bangladesh.50th over: Australia 186-4 (Smith 72, Wade 3) Ouch! Archer stings Wade with a ball that he can’t get out the way of, smacking him on the unprotected top arm. Sure enough, he finds an edge next ball, albeit one that doesn’t quite carry to first slip. “You would normally expect that to carry every day of the week here,” notes Mike Atherton on the telly, who knows a thing or two about Old Trafford.“Seems to me one of the things that makes a batsman great is that they eliminate certain aspects of their game,” writes Peter Salmon. “Ricky Ponting eliminated the cut shot, Steve Waugh the hook. Smith has simply taken this to its logical conclusion and eliminated getting out. So simple, and yet astonishing no one has thought of it before.” 49th over: Australia 184-4 (Smith 72, Wade 1) Looking back at the Head replay, it was hitting leg stump but not flush. Boy, how Australia need Wade at his best today. I interviewed him a couple of days ago and he talked about how important his last two seasons in Hobart have been to re-training himself to bat on English-style pitches. He’s off the mark second ball, taking a single to mid-on. From around the wicket, Broad has slipped past Head’s inside edge. There’s no doubt where that is going and no review required.48th over: Australia 181-3 (Smith 71, Head 18) Here it is, Archer’s quicker bumper at Smith, waiting until the last moment before swaying out of the way. That’s exactly what Justin Langer talked about before the Test. He’s forced to use his bat for the majority of the over, the radar hit at 90mph for the first time in this Test Match along the way. He leaves a temper to finish. Good contest.Here is the overseas TMS link, from the same place it always is. 47th over: Australia 181-3 (Smith 71, Head 18) Smith wants to pull Broad’s first ball but doesn’t get enough of it to turn the board over. He leaves the two short balls that follow, defending and dancing the delivery aimed straight. He keeps the strike with a flick to finish. 46th over: Australia 180-3 (Smith 70, Head 18) Archer is beginning the day from the Anderson End and this strange start to the morning continues. Smith is on top to begin, on the back foot crunching the England quick through cover to move to 66 - his average will improve in this innings. But forget about that, Archer drops him next ball in his follow through. It’s from a low full toss, about thigh height to his right, the chance fumbled. As every commentator will note, they’re never easy for the fast bowlers, but even so, the replay suggests he should have taken that. After the two consecutive boundaries, Archer finds the inside edge - once again, not far away from strife there. Head’s turn to finish, facing his first ball of the day, and he’s beaten by a good’un outside the off-stump. 45th over: Australia 171-3 (Smith 61, Head 18) Edge first ball! Broad has Smith pushing and nicking, albeit on the bounce to the cordon. He plays and misses at the next. Unusually nervy from the former captain. After getting bat on ball to defend the third, he’s into his full carry on, “wait there!” he roars, turning 180 degrees for reasons best explained by him. Now... a delay. What is going on here? Smith has seen something behind Broad he doesn’t like. Umpire Dharmasena runs off the field to get a... door shut at long-off? But he’s still not happy. Smith can see through the crack of the door a reflection off the Sky Cricket truck in the car park. You couldn’t make it up. Relaxed at last, a bumper follows - quite right - before Smith keeps the strike from the final ball of this eventful over, tucking square. Thanks, JP! Morning all. And what a lovely Manchester morning this is. Stuart Broad has the ball in his hand, he’ll be running away from me at the Brian Statham (or Broadcast) End. Steve Smith is on strike, resuming his innings on 60 - still three runs short of his average in Test cricket, would you believe. Let’s do it. PLAY! Righto, I can see cricket on the horizon which means Adam Collins must be around here somewhere. Please redirect emails to adam.collins.casual@the and tweets to @collinsadam. I like Marnus Labuschagne. He talks in plain English, cuts through the noise and tries to answer questions directly. He’s just given a nice interview to Ian Healy on Australian TV, in part discussing what it’s like being at the non-striker’s end while Steve Smith bats. “They just don’t look like they’re ever going to get him out,” he says matter of factly. “One unintended consequence of Stokes’s onslaught at Headingley might play through later in this Test,” begins Ian Forth. “It’s easy to imagine a scenario where Australia are, say, 380 runs ahead with 5 wickets in hand at the end of Day 4 - but still feel reluctant to declare, lest new records are smashed on the last day. Then, just possibly, England could escape with a draw 8 wickets down with The Ashes still alive going into The Oval.”David Murray is one of many who can’t understand why Chris Woakes was sacrificed for this Test. “Replacing Woakes, one of our most reliable performers with bat and ball over the last few years, with the relatively untested Overton makes no sense to me, nor does Root’s under-use of Woakes when he was in the team. I would much rather have seen one of the batsmen dropped and Rashid brought in, or perhaps Curran. Someone who might offer something different and take wickets.” This email arrived just as I was considering sharing this piece of CricViz analysis:I wonder if it reinforces the decision not to pick Woakes (i.e. there was no swing on offer therefore a specialist swing bowler would have been redundant), or if it amplifies the wrongness of his dropping. Who’d be a selector?Big day for Jack Leach, you’d reckon. Surely he’s pencilled in for 40 overs at no more than 2.5 rpo to allow the quicks to steam in for short bursts. Robin Hazlehurst has emailed in some astute observations. “England’s failure to remove Steve Smith on a good batting track on a difficult day for bowling is not good, but the bigger worry is still England’s batting. A score of 400 in the first innings of a Test happens, it just means the team batting second has to dig in and pile up the big runs. But is anyone currently feeling optimistic that England can or will do that? And does that doubt undermine the bowlers if they feel under more pressure to perform if they can’t trust the batting?” Geoff Lemon has taken a look at David Warner’s unflattering series statistics. The slump has been a surprise. Warner was one run away from topping the World Cup list in England only a few weeks ago, racking up 647 with three centuries. He even played his one-day cricket in what felt closer to his Test match mode, taking his time to build big innings. He seemed set for a substantial Ashes. There is no way to quantify whether the difference has been in fields or in bowlers or in facing the red Dukes ball versus the white Kookaburra or whether it is something less technical, less tangible, like the lasting scrutiny of an Ashes series settling in the way that a manic global tournament might not.It’s always a pleasure when Ian Forth logs on. “Your ‘Day Today’ reference of ‘if need be’ highlights one of the charming old rivers which run underground in English syntax,” he emails. “Here we catch a glimpse of the subjunctive in a conditional protasis shyly rising its timorous head above the narrative parapet.” I will take your word for it. Although, if we’re competing for Pseuds Corner, your email did evoke memories of Rising Damp, a wonderful poem by Ursula Fanthorpe. The build-up to the fourth Test was dominated by anticipation of the duel resuming between Jofra Archer and Steve Smith, but as Barney Ronay reports the spectacle underwhelmed. We came for Archer v Smith, part two. What we got was a slow-paced pitch and something more faithful to the rhythms of this insistently slow-burn form not to mention more in keeping with Smith’s own status as a great of the game.On the topic of bowling, Adam Giles was unimpressed with Overton and co. “I must admit, England looked lacklustre with the ball yesterday,” he emails, not inaccurately. “They seem to have no clear plans or new ideas. Rather than hold a line outside off with the occasional variation to try take a wicket, there just seems to be a “run up and bowl” culture. As boring as it would be, I’d happily see 10 consecutive overs of 5th-stump leaves from the batsmen rather than the spray currently being produced.” While largely in agreement, I think yesterday’s showing highlighted how well both sides have bowled so far this series. Craig Overton was on media duties for England last night and Ali Martin was around to hear the recalled paceman explain how tough the conditions were on day one.Conditions really didn’t suit running into bowl. It’s just the rhythm of the run-up – you feel like you’re getting to the crease and all of a sudden the wind hits you and it pushes you forward.Further proof, if proof be need be, that it is a lovely morning in Manchester. Also, a reminder to me of that time I met Neil Fairbrother sometime in the mid-90s when I was a kid and you could watch a game at Old Trafford from the car park through the gaps in the stands. Harvey was wearing memorably excellent squash shoes. Miss any of yesterday’s action? Fear not, because Vic Marks braved the wind and the rain to bring you this report from day one at Old Trafford.Australia won a good toss and after 44 overs had advanced to 170 for three, having been reduced to 28 for two in the first half‑hour. That was a most satisfactory outcome for Tim Paine’s side. Even better for the tourists was the sight of Steve Smith back in harness, batting just as he did in the first Test at Edgbaston.The weather. The good news is it’s dry in Manchester and the forecast indicates we should (touching wood with a lucky rabbit’s foot lodged between crossed fingers) remain rain-free all day. The possibility of any interruption is highest during the afternoon session. The bad news is it’s decidedly chilly. The forecast top temperature is 14C with everything kept on the fresh side of that maximum by a westerly breeze. Chris Raybould has the honour of sending in the first email of the day. It takes an unexpected turn. “Sitting here in Australia and wondering whether England might have had their two big games of the summer,” he writes. “I desperately want them to wrestle the Ashes back but as good as he is, Stokesy isn’t a one man team. What was it my mum used to say? Something about it’s better to have a champion team than a team of champions? Clones… maybe cloning is the way?”The day two pitch looks flat and full of runs. Composing a strategy to winkle out Steve Smith on a surface like this would drive any captain to distraction. Also, a nice reminder in the tweet below that because of the overs lost to rain today’s play is scheduled to last 30 minutes longer than usual. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day two of the fourth Test from Old Trafford.Day one went decisively Australia’s way. Tim Paine won a good toss before Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith neutralised any momentum England might have been carrying into the match following Ben Stokes’s heroics at Headingley. Only 44 overs were possible and with further rain delays likely over the next couple of days, it may prove difficult for either side to force a positive result on a surface that has so far proven the easiest to bat on this series. With runs on the board and England batting last on a pitch expected to break up and facilitate spin, Australia are in the box seat. For the hosts to assert themselves on the contest the opening hour of play will be vital.There will be plenty of scrutiny on Jofra Archer during the early exchanges. The emerging star underwhelmed for the first time in his international career yesterday, bowling without intent for portions, reflecting a general demeanour that suggested he did not relish his time in the field on such a wintry day. Joe Root must demand more from his spearhead. If you don’t know the drill by now, I am holding the fort for the next hour or so until play begins but once the action gets underway I’ll hand you over to Adam Collins at Old Trafford. If you want to join in before play, starting at 11am BST, you can find me on Twitter  or you can send me an email."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37de9b683e104cf2334f25e9368a01c378638096/0_0_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f82a8ac8f4fcd7b7afc64aa9ecbb8801","title":"how can i force my windows 10 laptop to update","story":"Windows Update tells Frank that Windows 10 is up to date, but he still needs to install a new versionWhy does my HP Pavilion laptop tell me that Windows 10 is up to date, but at the same time tells me I’m running a version that’s nearing the end of support, and recommends that I update to the most recent version? FrankFirst, some background. Microsoft used to provide new versions of Windows every three or more years, and support them for 10 years. Examples included Windows XP and Windows 7. They didn’t change unless Microsoft released a service pack update, such as Windows 7 SP1.When it launched Windows 10 four years ago, Microsoft switched to delivering “Windows as a Service” (WaaS). Now the operating system is updated every month, at no charge, with two “milestone” releases each year. These are named after their intended release dates, such as Windows 10 1809 and 1903. (The March update, 1903, was actually released in May.)Thanks to WaaS, there are no more expensive “big bang” updates, which used to cause large organisations enormous pain and left some of them clinging to obsolete versions of Windows for more than a decade. Smaller, more frequent updates are much easier to handle, especially using tools such as WSUS (Windows Server Update Services), SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) and WUfB (Windows Update for Business). They are a bit of a pain for some home users, but Microsoft is trying to alleviate any problems.With WaaS, Microsoft also changed its support system. It now has a Modern Lifecycle Policy where basic versions of Windows 10 are only supported for 18 months. You have lost the 10 years of support, but your support now continues for ever, as long as you keep installing new versions of Windows 10. In reality, “for ever” means for as long as your device can run them.The net result is that Microsoft is still supporting at least three versions of Windows, but the three will usually have been launched about six months apart, instead of three years apart.You are, I deduce, running Windows 10 version 1803: this was released on 30 April 2018, and reaches the end of its supported life on 12 November 2019. So Windows Update is telling you, correctly, that this version is up to date.However, you have failed to install either of the two latest milestone releases, 1809 and 1903. You therefore have an up-to-date version of an out-of-date version of Windows 10. Your current version does not need updating, it needs replacing. This is what you should do.You are in much the same position as someone who is still running an up-to-date version of Windows 7, having skipped later releases. The main differences are that the timescales are much shorter and the upgrades are now free.Microsoft would like everyone to be on the same version of Windows, and it would not be economic to support 10 or 20 different versions. It is therefore using the end of support – and the end of security fixes – to push users into updating their systems, even though the Windows 10 Enterprise version of 1803 will be supported for another year (until 10 November 2020).These PCs are less of a burden because large organisations use tools such as WSUS to update thousands of PCs, rather than each one downloading the code separately. Either way, Microsoft must still be producing security fixes for 1803 it just won’t let you have them.With WaaS, not everybody gets the code at the same time, as you might expect. Instead, the task of updating more than 800m PCs is spread over many months.A few million people want the latest version, even if it isn’t finished. They join the “insider ring” of beta testers, who look for bugs before the operating system is released to a wider audience. Some are what Microsoft calls “seekers”: they check manually for updates and install them as soon as they become available. Most people just ignore new versions until they are reminded to install them, or – if they really are not paying attention – the installation is practically under way.In general, it’s safer to install milestone updates later rather than sooner. If you upgrade to version 1903 now, you will get a version that has had months of testing, and that has already been installed on hundreds of millions of PCs. If you wait for the “fall version”, currently called 19H2, then you will get code that hasn’t been as thoroughly debugged. Also, it will be a bigger leap from 1803, and big leaps are inherently riskier than small ones.You don’t have to be on the current version of Windows 10, where some new features may introduce a few new bugs. However, it’s a bad idea to fall two or three versions behind.The mass upgrade process depends on a lot of machine learning based on feedback from telemetry. The PCs that seem easiest to upgrade correctly are offered updates before the ones that look trickier. As bugs are found and fixed, updates are offered to more and more PCs.Updates are sometimes suspended for various reasons. It happened to some PCs that had not been patched for the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. With 1903, some users were put on hold because their PCs were running an outdated Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) driver. In my case, the warning went away and Microsoft installed a Microsoft driver. For the reader who wasn’t so lucky, it should have been fixed by the KB4512941 update on 30 August.Update attempts can also fail because your PC does not have enough storage space. You need enough room for the version of Windows that is running, the version you have downloaded, and a security copy of the old version of Windows 10 in case you need to roll back a failed upgrade. This backup is now deleted after about 10 days it used to be about 30 days.Otherwise, you may be able to solve update problems by downloading the Update Assistant.You can also contact Microsoft support via the “Get help” link on the right hand side of the Windows Update page in the Settings (cogwheel) app. I tried it once, got instant help, and it was helpful. The Microsoft Support web page for Windows 10 offers further options including “call me back”, “schedule a call”, and “ask the community” (by posting in the support forum).The current 1903May 2019 version of Windows 10 is a bit more flexible. You can click a pause button to “pause updates for 7 days” or skip down to “Advanced options” and pause updates for up to 35 days. You can pick a date when you want to resume, which is useful for business trips and holidays. After 35 days, you have to install some updates before you can pause it again.With the forthcoming 19H21909 version, Microsoft plans further changes. In particular, it will try using the same trick as major browsers: install feature updates without turning them on. This introduces an exciting new three-letter abbreviation: CFR (Controlled Feature Rollout). Microsoft defines this as: “A method to progressively rollout new features by gradually increasing the audience in a controlled manner.” In other words, every PC will get the same updates, but new features will be turned on gradually while telemetry checks that they are working correctly.According to Microsoft’s John Cable, who is in charge of Windows servicing and delivery, the aim is to make the twice-yearly updates more like the monthly updates. In the same blogpost, he said: “Anyone running the May 2019 update and updating to the new release will have a far faster update experience.”Have you got a question?

They had booked through Politrip, a bespoke travel company that charges $1,200 a person to ship them around Democratic campaign events.Iowa has an outsized importance in selecting a party’s nominee for president. It is the first state to vote in the primary process, and a good – or bad – performance here can make or break presidential campaigns. This year, more than 20 presidential hopefuls are crisscrossing Iowa, kissing babies, eating bad food and sitting on tractors, all with the hope of winning the February 2020 caucus.“I thought the opportunity to come out here and possibly meet a couple of candidates was an opportunity I didn’t want to miss.”Gray ended up seeing 23 out of 24 major candidates – many of those at the Iowa state fair, where the  met some of the mostly British and Irish holidaymakers. The fair, a sprawling exhibition of livestock, fairground rides, bars and deep-fried food served on a stick, is a must-visit for presidential hopefuls. Over the course of a week the majority of the 24 Democratic candidates made an appearance, along with less-heralded independent contenders and Bill Weld, a Republican challenger to Donald Trump.Politrip is the brainchild of Paddy Brown, a Northern Ireland-based PhD student and American politics enthusiast. According to Brown, its a mixed bunch of people on the trip.“A couple of lawyers have come out, a couple of people working in retail, and a lot in between,” Brown said as he hung out at the “soapbox” stage, an area of the fair reserved for presidential candidates to attempt to charm the crowd: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren spoke over the weekend.Many of the political vacationers end up volunteering for campaigns – they can express their preferred candidate in advance – with people knocking on doors in support of candidates such as the New Jersey senator Cory Booker and Warren.“There’s a couple of people just working summer jobs trying to figure out their next steps, and a lot of people actually who want to do this to get campaign cycle experience on their CV,” said Brown.One of the most intriguing aspects of the 2020 Democratic race is the number of candidates – many of whom have, to put it generously, little chance of winning. As Brown and the  chatted, a slight man wearing black jeans took to the soapbox stage.“Who’s that?” said one woman.“His name is … Joe Sestak,” her partner replied, reading haltingly from a pamphlet.The higher-profile candidates are, understandably, more of a draw.Etienne Seymour, from Southampton, was wearing a T-shirt in support of Warren, who is currently vying with Sanders for second place in the polls. Seymour, 22, had spent days knocking on doors touting Warren’s policies, and had also been deployed to cheer for the senator at rallies.“I got a hug from her. I’ve had two now,” Seymour said.To pay for the trip, Seymour had taken a job at John Lewis during her summer break from Nottingham University, where she studies international relations. Seymour hopes the experience will boost her CV – but she was also keen to sample some of Iowa’s more unusual offerings.“I want to see the butter cow,” she said – a cow modelled from butter which has become an Iowa state fair staple.“And I do want to try a corn dog.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9373fd511cc25cb2e91eadd595c421e78378a6d4/0_115_3967_2381/master/3967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf179b4ec4fe22d04b83d78b303bad2","title":"italys coalition enemies open way matteo salvini return","story":"Tie-up of rival parties likely to break from hardline immigration policyItaly’s new coalition government between the centre-left Democratic party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement has been sworn in, with many analysts casting doubt on how long it will last.The two parties are longstanding enemies. Should they fail, new elections might lead to them both being punished and open the way for a comeback by Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League.The coalition looks likely to break from some of the hardline immigration measures pushed by Salvini, interior minister in the last government.Italy was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with the Five Star Movement (M5S), as he sought to exploit his party’s popularity to force a snap election and seize the prime ministership. But the former interior minister, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the Democratic party (Partito Democratico, or PD).After two weeks of negotiations, on Wednesday, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced his  team of ministers. The list includes Roberto Gualtieri, an influential PD member of the European parliament, as economy minister. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, will be foreign minister. Luciana Lamorgese, a veteran of the interior ministry, in charge of planning refugee and migrant reception centres in northern Italy, has succeeded Salvini as interior minister.Many challenges lie ahead. On Tuesday, the parties published a 26-point programme that would underpin the government. At the top of the list was a commitment to use the forthcoming budget to help to stimulate economic growth, but also a promise that it would not endanger public finances.Italy has the second-largest debt burden in the EU as a proportion of economic output, and the pact called for greater flexibility from Brussels to overcome the “excessive rigidity” of existing budget rules.Emphasising social justice, the two parties pledged to introduce a minimum salary, avoid a planned VAT sales rise and boost spending on education, research and welfare. The programme also called for a web tax on multinationals and the creation of a public bank to help boost development in the south.Massimiliano Panarari, a political science professor at Luiss University in Rome, said of the coalition: “It is a government that is surely favoured by Brussels. But in order to carry out the programme it will need to govern until 2022. So far, this seems very difficult.”Others felt that the prospect of Salvini forming a far-right government with Brothers of Italy, a party with a neo-fascist lineage, would hold the new coalition together.He added: “M5S knew it wasn’t a good idea to forge an alliance with the League, with a party even more extreme than they are. They knew that in order to survive they had to shed their anti-establishment tendencies. With M5S losing ground, the League slowly began to capture their votes.

Social media users, though, accused Jeong of violating her rights, with one asking: “Would a male nominee have been asked this question?”South Korea has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, despite government attempts to encourage couples to have more children by investing billions of dollars in child-rearing subsidies and daycare services.The country’s fertility rate – the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – fell to a record low of 0.98 last year, or less than one baby per woman. That rate is far short of the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population.Many women, however, say they are reluctant to have children, citing the high cost of raising families and a conservative work culture that makes it difficult for parents of young children to balance their jobs with family life.Jeong later apologised for his remarks, claiming that he had only wanted to highlight South Korea’s demographic crisis and had not meant to insult Joh, according to the Korea Herald.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269b0750e58149b2aedaabb181562910b01dea45/0_30_1674_1004/master/1674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=928b7927c1a3a47d92e439c1ed386a37","title":"taliban claims bombing us embassy peace talks kabul","story":"Bomb attack in centre of Kabul close to Afghan government buildings A suicide bomber has blown himself up in the centre of Kabul, Afghan officials said, with the blast rattling windows and doors in an area near embassies and government buildings.The Taliban, who are in the midst of negotiating a pact with the United States, claimed responsibility.It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties in the attack on Thursday, by a checkpoint on a main road near the headquarters of Afghanistan’s Nato force and the US embassy.“Ambulances and rescue teams are being rushed to the blast site,” the interior ministry spokesman, Nasrat Rahimi, said.Video footage and photographs posted on social media showed cars and small shops ripped apart and police cordoning off the road.There has been no let-up in violence in Afghanistan even though Taliban and US officials have been making progress in negotiations aimed at securing a deal on a withdrawal of American troops in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.On Monday, a Taliban suicide truck bomber attacked a compound used by international organisations in Kabul, killing at least 16 people and wounding more than 100.The US’s senior negotiator for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said this week that the two sides had drawn up a draft framework agreement under which US troops would leave five military bases in Afghanistan within 135 days of the signing of the pact. There are some 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, deployed at various bases across the country.Khalilzad is expected to meet Afghan and Nato officials to explain the draft agreement, which must still be approved by President Donald Trump before it can be signed. Khalilzad, a veteran Afghan–American diplomat, has shared details of the draft with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and sought his opinion before firming up an agreement that could bring an end to America’s longest military intervention overseas.However, Ghani’s government is seeking clarifications from the United States on the draft agreement."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Do Brexit or die?

The same is true of construction, 45 down from 45.3, and manufacturing, 47.4 down from 48. The difference is the latter two sectors are now shrinking, as is business activity overall. UK plc only avoided a cricketing hat-trick because the video replay umpire didn’t overturn a marginal LBW decision made on the field after the third ball.\u0026nbspUK manufacturing output slumps to seven-year low amid Brexit concernsPMI survey reveals biggest slide in UK construction output since 2009How a no-deal Brexit will affect the economy — now and in the futureBusiness expectations are at their lowest for three years, with economists starting to pencil in the first recession since the financial crisis, unless there is a dramatic pick up in September. It’s hard to see where the fairy dust might come from.\u0026nbspThese are the sort of figures that should be of deep concern to any sane and sensible government of whatever hue, all the more so to\u0026nbspa Conservative government with its\u0026nbspmuch ballyhooed, and largely undeserved, reputation for economic competence. In more normal times, they’d scare the pants off it.\u0026nbspBut these are not normal times and this is not a normal government. It is run by a party that has completely lost its marbles, having been dragged to the edge of a cliff by gangsters who have just one policy of note. \u0026nbspThe global situation mightn’t be terribly cheery, but the contraction that is getting underway in Britain is an entirely self created one, a squeeze manufactured in Downing Street.\u0026nbspAnd remember, this could just be a taste of what’s\u0026nbspto come, a red balloon or two of warning of what Johnnywise the dancing clown of Downing Street could yet brings down on us as he emerges from his sinister house.\u0026nbspThis brings us to another set of figures published this morning. They concern household debt and come courtesy of the TUC ahead of its annual Congress.\u0026nbspThey give voice to the disturbing level of unsecured borrowing engaged in by the average Briton before one even starts to consider things such as mortgages.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Since the clip was shared online, Hart has been condemned for his attitude towards Lil Nas X.\u0026nbspThe Daily Beast\u0027s Goldie Taylor wrote: Kevin Hart knows exactly what the \u0027so what\u0027 is here and why a young black boy would closet his sexuality until he believed it was safe. Why not simply listen, give Lil Nas X the space and deference to tell his own story...Vox\u0027s Jenee Desmond-Harris said: Kevin Hart\u0027s rage and bitterness about anything to do with gay people is so jarring. Lil Nas X seems so stable and healthy and Kevin seems so... not okay.Hart stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars in December last year after a number of homophobic tweets he had posted resurfaced, including one where he said he would beat his son if he found him playing with a doll\u0027s house and say stop, that\u0027s gay.In his 2010 comedy special\u0026nbspSeriously Funny,\u0026nbsphe also claimed having a gay son was his biggest fear.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mobility made it possible for animals to make an unmistakable footprint on Earth, both literally and metaphorically,” said lead researcher Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geosciences with the Virginia Tech College of Science.The animal that made the latest prints would have looked like a millipede and was around a quarter of an inch wide and four inches long. It would have dragged its body across a muddy ocean floor and rested along the way, leaving a trail that is 23 inches long.\u0026nbspIt would have been made up of 50 or more\u0026nbspbody segments, a back and belly, and head and tail, researchers say.Tiny 4.2m-year-old monkey discovery casts new light on evolutionChimpanzees caught fishing for crabsGlobal CO2 levels rise to highest point since evolution of humansThe find also marks what could be the\u0026nbspfirst\u0026nbspexample of decision-making among animals. The trail suggests an effort to move towards or away from something, which indicates the animal could have had a sophisticated central nervous\u0026nbspsystem.\u0026nbsp“Animals and particularly humans are movers and shakers on Earth. Their ability to shape the face of the planet is ultimately tied to the origin of animal motility,” said Professor Xiao.\u0026nbsp“We are the most impactful animal on Earth.

There are a lot of them.”So is that the answer to the riddle which has fascinated the world for generations?Professor Gemmell said: “Well, our data doesn’t reveal their size, but the sheer quantity of the material says that we can’t discount the possibility that there may be giant eels in Loch Ness.“Therefore we can’t discount the possibility that what people see and believe is the Loch Ness Monster might be a giant eel.“Divers have claimed that they’ve seen eels that are as thick as their legs in the loch, whether they’re exaggerating or not – I don’t know – there is a possibility that there are very large eels present in the loch.“Whether they are as big as around four metres\u0026nbspas some of these sightings suggest – well, as a geneticist I think about mutations and natural variation a lot, and while an eel that big would be well outside the normal range, it seems not impossible that something could grow to such unusual size.”He added: “Further investigation is needed to confirm or refute the theory, so based on our data, giant eels remain a plausible idea.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The unidentified creature was apparently enormous - around 25 feet long and four feet high, with no discernable limbs, but with a large body and long neck. Spicer said it left a trail of broken undergrowth as it headed towards the loch.The following year, after at least two more sightings of unexplained creatures in the area, the most famous photograph of the Loch Ness Monster was taken by respected British surgeon, Colonel Robert Wilson.\u0026nbspIt was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934, but Wilson initially refused to have his name published alongside, so it became known as “the surgeon’s photograph”.In the 1990s the photograph was revealed to have been a hoax masterminded by a man named Christian Spurling, who reportedly wanted to get some form of revenge on the Daily Mail after the newspaper publicly ridiculed his father-in-law - the actor and director Marmaduke Wetherell, after he claimed he had found Nessie footprints which later turned out to be a hoax.Spurling made the fake monster out of a toy submarine fitted with a serpent head and neck.Since then, regular “sightings” have been claimed and even more regular hoaxes made.Additional reporting by SWNSShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

His brother Abdulrahman was just 7 years old when he died. \u0027He bought it for me in the market and told me to take care of it. We used to watch the cartoon together. I still watch it now.\u0027 He doesn\u0027t remember much about his home in Syria but he thinks it was as big as a Unicef Makani centre, where he goes for learning and psychosocial support. \u0027Most of our stuff we had to leave behind but my mum packed Ben 10 so I could play with it. It\u0027s so important to me. This toy is as precious to me as my own brother. I\u0027m going to keep it forever.\u0027 The best part of Omar’s day is sunset when he comes home from school and Makani, eats food and does his homework sitting with his family. His favourite subject is maths and he studies hard to achieve his dream. ‘I want to become a pilot. I used to be afraid of planes but now I want to travel. Maybe if I get on a plane I won’t be afraid anymore.’ Omar now has two little sisters in Za’atari Refugee Camp. He lets his youngest sister Islam play with Ben 10. When he gets dirty he puts him in the washing machine. ‘I’m the only boy now. I think my brother would be proud of me.’ Makani (which translates as ‘My Space’) centres provide an integrated set of services to children in the camp, including learning support, community-based child protection, early childhood development, adolescent and youth participation, life skills and innovation labs426 Yahya, 13, holds a passport photo of himself‘This is a photo of me. It’s my memory. It means a lot to me because it was taken for my school registration form. I was in the first grade for only one week and then we had to come here. I have memories from this time, both good and bad. I remember how my school looked, it was beautiful. I had started making friends and playing football. But the bad memories are of the war, when we were under bombing. I want to forget this memory and the memory of the journey here. It was night time when we left Syria and we could hardly see the road in front of us. We moved through valleys full of thorns that hurt when we stepped on them. People started throwing away their belongings because of how hard the journey was, anything heavy had to go. I had to leave behind my school books, my pens and my colours because my mum told me too. She said it wouldn’t be long before we came back home. But it’s been six years.’ He is now in sixth grade‘I was in first grade in Syria and my dad gave me this schoolbag. I was only little then but now I’m in the sixth grade.’ Although the schoolbag is now too small for him, he keeps it safe. ‘It’s important to me because my father gave it to me as a gift and I remember him by it. Also because it is from my country.’He still has happy memories from life in Syria, including going to school. ‘I used to feel really happy when break came and I could go to the shop. I remember playing in the schoolyard, my friends chasing me and me chasing them.’ Although he preferred his school in Syria, he still enjoys going to school in the camp. His favourite subject is English and he wants to become an English teacher. He has no plans to give up the old schoolbag. ‘I will keep this schoolbag forever. I will tell my children my father gave this to me and I kept it safe for all these years to show you.’726 Ayoub, 13, holds a set of spoons‘These are my spoons. I was six when I left Syria. I wanted to take them with me from Syria as a memory so I grabbed them as we were leaving the house and I carried them the whole way here. I used to eat my meals with them back at home so I thought that I am going to need them to eat when I come to the camp.’ Ayoub has dropped out of school in the camp but he continues to attend a Makani centre for learning and psychosocial support.  ‘When I grow up, I want to be a taxi driver because I want to leave the camp and go everywhere. I’ve been in a taxi before and I loved it. Inside the camp we don’t have taxis, only bicycles. I’m not in school so I can’t be a doctor or an engineer but I think it’s the easiest thing for me to do when I grow up. In Za\u0027atari, there are 13 Makani centres serving over 7,000 children. Located in every district of the camp, vulnerable children, youth and communities have access to Makani, no matter where they live826 Hamza, 14, holds a handwritten note, from his teacher in Syria‘This note was written by my teacher when I was in first grade in Syria. It’s a thank you letter to my family saying that I am a good student.’ The note calls Hamza a star. ‘I made sure to put it in my bag when we were coming here.’ Hamza is now in the eighth grade and has made a big effort to keep achieving academically, despite the disruption to his education. ‘It’s important for me to keep it because it reminds me of when I was the best student in my class.’926 Mohammad, 16, holds his hat‘This is my hat. My father used to work in Damascus. He bought it there and gave it to me. Life then was magnificent.’ He still remembers the beginning of the conflict in Syria. ‘Children were being killed and houses were being bombed. My father feared for our lives and for our future. When we had to leave Syria, it was winter. I remember crossing a valley and the ground being difficult to walk on. It was dangerous, cars were sliding on the ice.’ Mohammad brought as much of his clothing as he could carry to Za’atari but the hat remains his most loved item. ‘I wore it all the way crossing to Jordan and I still wear it every winter. It’s so precious, it reminds me of Syria. And it’s a gift from my Dad which is why it means so much to me.’Mohammad lives with his parents and brothers and sisters in the camp. He is in tenth grade and likes school. He feels like the camp is home because he is surrounded by his family and a bigger Syrian community who keep their memories alive. ‘My parents tell me about when we were little. They say that Syria was beautiful. I will go back home to my village and continue living there. I will bring my hat and tell my children everything about my story.’  When asked if it’s important for children in Za’atari to try to remember Syria when some of the memories are so traumatic, he replies straight away: ‘Both. I think it’s very important to keep memories but also to forget the horrors of war.’1126 Ahmad, 12, holds a key ring inscribed with his father\u0027s name‘This key ring belonged to my dad, I inherited it from him a long time ago. He died of a heart attack at the start of the war in Syria. I barely have any memories of my dad but the few I have are very precious. My favourite memory is the time he brought us to the river for a picnic and we played in the water. If I want to remember him, I take out his key ring and look at it.’Ahmad wants to be an architect when he grows us because his father worked in construction. ‘I still have a long way to go as I am only in the sixth grade but I will do my best. It would make my Dad proud of me.’ Ahmad lives with his grandmother and brother in the camp. Although they don’t have much, he says that their love is enough for him‘This toy is from Syria. Her name is Farah.’ Yara’s father gave her Farah for her birthday. ‘He used to buy me so many things.’ She enjoys taking off Farah’s dress, washing it and dressing her again. ‘I take care of her because I love her. I feel happy when I’m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood – it’s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.’ Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. ‘It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we’re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we’re going to Za’atari. I told her don’t made any sound because if you do, we can’t go in. She was scaredWe were both happy when we arrived in Za’atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah’s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.’ Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them.  She wants to return to Syria. ‘I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I’m bringing all of my toys1526 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria‘My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer’s studio where this photo was taken.’ Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. ‘I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn’t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren’t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It’s pure happiness.’ Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. ‘I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.’ As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. ‘I have to be courageous and not fear anything.’‘These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I’m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don’t remember.’Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. ‘We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I’m so far away from home.‘This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That’s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.’Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. ‘I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I’m going to keep it as long as I can.’2126 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She’s a gift from my mum so she’s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.’ These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad.  She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. ‘I will keep Lulu forever.’2326 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father‘That’s my father’s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn’t bring with me.’ Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. ‘I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father’s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.’ *name changed to protect identity‘I brought this dog,’ says Shath. ‘I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don’t remember much.  When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za’atari.  ‘The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we’re getting an education. We have friends and partiesShatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. ‘I love the Makani, it’s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. ‘My toy dog will always be with me. I’ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it’s the same as mine.’2626 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father‘That photo was taken in Syria. It’s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn’t come with us and he died in Syria.’ Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. ‘I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.’ If my dad was here now he would ask me “what do you want to be when your grow up” and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you’. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identitySyrian refugee children attending Unicef Makani centres in Za\u0027atari refugee camp share the stories behind the objects they brought from Syria and the powerful memories that they represent226 Omar, 11, holds his teddy bear Ben 10‘My Ben 10 transforms into an alien from space and he saves the world,’ says the 11-year-old. ‘I brought it from Syria.

This week, after a long and exhaustive selection process, he touched down in the UK to take up a scholarship at a prestigious boarding school in Wales.\u0026nbspIn doing so he became one of only a handful of Syrian refugees to make it to the UK without being part of a resettlement programme and with no help from the government.\u0026nbsp“I never dreamed I would be successful,” he says, speaking to The Independent in his now empty apartment in the town of Bar Elias, just days before he is due to leave for the UK“At the beginning, when I first applied, I was really upset and miserable and hopeless. There are lots of programmes and scholarships like this. I was applying but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s not going to make any difference.”It is easy to see why Nour was so pessimistic. The town of Bar Elias, where he has spent the last three years of his life, is home to thousands of refugees from neighbouring Syria. It sits just off the main road between Beirut and Damascus, around ten miles from the Syrian border.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was left with two sisters, but they were soon married and unable to care for him. He was on his way to an orphanage when a cousin stepped in to bring him to Lebanon.Nour’s love of school kept him going. He was a good student in Syria, and desperately wanted to carry on studying in Lebanon, but as soon as he arrived he was put to work in his cousin’s dairy factory.\u0026nbsp“I didn\u0027t have any free time for myself. I wanted to study English but I didn’t even have time to read a book. My cousin wouldn\u0027t let me study,” he says. \u0026nbspThe same is true of many Syrian children. According to the United Nations children’s charity, the average monthly income of refugee families in the Bekaa Valley is around $50 (£41), while their expenses are close to $120. The result is that many children are sent to work to make up the difference.Nour lost his both his parents in Syria when he was 10-years-old (Sam Tarling)Nour was still going to school while working for his cousin, but his job was getting in the way.\u0026nbsp“Living with him was really hard part in my life. I was suffering so much. That\u0027s why I decided to leave him and live on my own,” he says. \u0026nbspSo, at 15-years-old, a refugee in a country where most Syrians were struggling to survive, he moved into a one-room apartment on his own. He found a job painting houses, and on the weekend he worked in a restaurant chopping fruit.\u0026nbsp“It was the worst place I have ever lived. It didn\u0027t have a door even,” he says. “I was doing everything myself. Cooking, cleaning, and studying. I worked during my time off to support myself. I was only thinking about surviving.” \u0026nbspThere were other difficulties, too, not unique to Nour\u0027s life.\u0026nbspEight years into Syria’s devastating civil war, more than a million refugees remain stuck in limbo here, too afraid to return home to a country still stricken by conflict, where forced conscription and arbitrary arrests are commonplace.Lebanon was praised early on for its hospitality to Syrians, but as the war dragged on, pressure has increased for them to leave. Evictions and army raids on refugee camps are on the rise, towns have introduced curfews specifically for Syrians, ministers and politicians have made repeated calls for them to go home.\u0026nbspA worsening Lebanese economy only added to these tensions. Nour felt that undercurrent of anger.\u0026nbsp“I love Lebanon, but Lebanon doesn\u0027t love me,” he says. “Being a Syrian in the Lebanese society is really hard. Even though you have really close friends, you can\u0027t erase from his mind the idea that I\u0027m a Syrian and you\u0027re a Lebanese.”\u0026nbsp“I had friends for more than five years and sometimes they something so racist to me, they really hurt me. Even though I was so integrated, they will still treat you like a foreigner.” \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNour did more than survive. In his high school exams, he achieved the 28th highest marks in the entire country.\u0026nbspCharity workers started to take notice. He began receiving some assistance from Save the Children to help him stay in school. In 2018, he was visited by its then CEO, the former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The meeting would have a profound impact on the course of his life.\u0026nbsp“She came to my house and she suggested that I apply to a boarding school. I had no idea what a boarding school was,” he says. “She wrote the name of it on a piece of paper and a few months later I applied.”The boarding school, which The Independent is not naming to protect Nour’s anonymity, offered a scholarship for refugees — but competition for the place was fierce. What followed gruelling process of online tests and interviews.\u0026nbsp“After the first interview I said I don\u0027t care. I didn\u0027t think it would go any further. When I realised that things were getting more serious, I started to think about it more and more.”He waited and waited for news. When the day finally came, it was the worst possible timing. He was due to take three exams and he couldn’t keep his mind off what could be the biggest decision of his life.\u0026nbspI woke up at 5am I looked at my phone and found nothing. I thought ‘oh my God, I have been rejected.’ Then I remembered that the Wifi was turned off. I turned it on and I found the email.”“I started shouting. I didn\u0027t want to go to school to do the exams. I was writing and I was so sleepy. I couldn\u0027t concentrate. I wanted to go home. I wanted to dance.”While Nour’s story has a happy ending, there are some 2.5 million Syrian children scattered across the region who have little hope of following in his footsteps. \u0026nbsp“Nour’s story illustrates how important education is for children. He fought against all odds to make it to the UK, and while we supported him throughout his application process, he did it by himself thanks to his remarkable will and high grades,” says Allison Zelkowitz, Save the Children’s country director in Lebanon. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“But resettlement of Syrian refugees in countries outside of the region has decreased. The UK can play a key role to ensure that more resettlement places are accessible and increase access to other pathways for refugees, such as students visas. Supporting learning can be a lifeline to some of the highest performing Syrian refugees”.It would be a nervous few months while he made preparations for his new life. There were still so many things that could go wrong. It is not uncommon for Syrians to be detained at Beirut’s airport for bureaucratic infractions and there was always the chance that he could face problems on the other end, in the UK.\u0026nbspAs he sits beside his packed bags in his apartment, Nour is a bundle of excitement. He is fascinated with aviation, and airports especially, and has spent the last few weeks studying the layout of Heathrow Terminal 5, where he is due to land.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t have a clear idea of what he wants to do after school, only that he wants to tell his story to as many people as possible.\u0026nbsp“All I know about what I want to be in the future is that want to express all my opinions. When I was a kid I felt I was restricted by what I could say. I want to share my story. I don\u0027t want to be in one place. I want to move,” he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp*Nour arrived in the UK this week and is now getting ready to start the school term.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The decision must be for the common sense of the British people.”That decision was duly taken in the biggest single-issue democratic vote in British history.Hammond has been fighting ever since to turn it on its head.This is the real constitutional outrage. A defeated rump of Remainers, egged on by blatantly biased Commons Speaker John Bercow, is using every Parliamentary trick to destroy Brexit.Some threaten to occupy Parliament until dragged out by police.Left-wing class warriors will infuriate voters by blocking bridges and highways and stopping them getting to work.John Major and meddling Gina Miller have launched a Supreme Court bid to block No Deal.These are petulant tantrums. And they will fail.There is no chance Brussels will budge on the backstop, says chief negotiator Michel Barnier.

Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party commands  per cent.Once Britain leaves on October , Nigel will fold.“The Brexit Party would be happy to make Boris a hero,” he says. In , Farage deserves a peerage.Added together, his votes would give Boris an -seat majority. In the actual campaign, with a vote-winning Budget and Boris in fully fired-up election mode, that could turn into a landslide.At which point, we can wave good riddance to John Major, Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Anna Soubry, Dom Grieve and Uncle Phil Hammond and all.And get on with the job of repairing the wreckage they leave behind.The question nobody has asked is why Chancellor Sajid Javid appointed her as his media adviser in the first place.“Special advisers are a minister’s Praetorian Guard,” says one Cabinet figure. “They must be completely loyal.

The message is clear: Useful work is no longer done here.If Remainer MPs block Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan this week, we should place similar signs around the Palace of Westminster.Parliamentarians will have turned the place into a toxic waste ground which no longer fulfils a decent .It will have become an eyesore, a municipal liability, an assembly which no longer represents its voters and has become a poisonous threat to them. It will stand as sad testament to the misjudgement of its management in latter days.If Speaker John Bercow, former Chancellor Philip Hammond and other dead-set Remainers such as Sir Keir Starmer refuse to enact the  referendum result, the British Parliament — supposedly the fount of modern parliamentary democracy — will have lost its centuries-old claim to give voice to the people. The consequences of that would be enormous.The word “Parliament”, first used in these islands in the early s, comes from the French “parler” .The th Century Parliament was where leading men of England could let the king know how they felt about his laws and taxes. Kings did not always take much notice but the principle was established: That the people of England would be heard by their ruler.Over the ages, the people slowly became the boss. Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters. It’s weird and it is not democracy.If our Parliament ceases to have a point, so do its buildingsand so do its members’ privileges .The very nation state becomes questionable, for what is the point of a state without a democratic Parliament Before long you find yourself asking what is the point of Western Europe, Nato and the whole web of Western values that separate us from Putin’s Russia and other hostile powers.Such is the importance of the decisions facing our MPs this week. Let’s hope they ponder hard before vetoing Brexit, the greatest-ever popular demand for change. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Suddenly, the all-encompassing full-time job into which you poured all your time and effort becomes harder to juggle with what’s going on at home.Ruth Davidson is the case in point, after tendering her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives because, among other reasons, the thought of getting on the road to fight two elections in  months would have once fired her up but now fills her with dread.Ruth, who will remain as an MSP, adds: “Additionally, I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend. The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitment to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a dferent choice.”It was a similar story when former sports minister Tracey Crouch revealed she recently turned down the chance toto Government because of her three-year-old son Freddie.She’s still an MP but says: “I may or may not ever get the chance again to join the Cabinet, but I definitely won’t get this time back with Freddie.”And therein lies the rub for any Government, or indeed corporation, trying to inflate the number of women appointed to jobs that pay extremely well and, consequently, often involve great responsibility and super-human levels of commitment.As I have frequently suggested in this column over the years, the paucity of women in the Cabinet and certain boardrooms isn’t necessarily down to sexism, it might also be because women have chosen not to be there.We have the wombs, therefore we have the babies. That’s unlikely to change any time soon.Some manage — with the help of nannies or wider family — to juggle a high-powered job with motherhood, somechoose the route of flexible working and somechoose to stay at home. Each to their own.But until the day that tiny hand grenade is placed on your chest and someone removes the pin . . . you never know which option you’ll take.UNDER Theresa May’s lame premiership, Remainers struggled to contain their smugness. In public they pretended their disruptive tactics were rooted in concern for those poor, misguided souls who had voted for Brexit not knowing what it really meant.But in private they were rubbing their hands in glee at how they were tying the Government in knots with their cleverness and, consequently, thwarting the democratic will of the .million who voted Leave.But look at them now – they have come up against someone who not only knows all their cunning moves but has a few of his own to head them off at the pass.The smugness has evaporated – replaced by panic or, in the case of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq on the Jeremy Vine show, angry screeching while asking a Brexiteerhe would vote to leave the EU , er, it meant he would be decapitated in the process.Meanwhile, superannuated student Jeremy Corbyn – devoid of any solutions – suggests protests that will paralyse our cities and merely disrupt the rest of us trying to get to work. In short, the wheels are starting to come off the Remainer bus.Britain will leave the EUon October  and honour the democratic vote of .

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly. Simon Cowell, though, had some words of comfort for Ashleigh.“Pusdey’s in dog heaven, looking down on you now, thinking . . . ” “I was the talent. I was the bloody talent.”DIVA Forever’s Gemma Collins landed in Los Angeles last Wednesday night on ITVBe with all the charm and subtlety of a jolt from the San Andreas Fault.Take comfort, though, from the fact our gain is very much Calornia’s loss.Because within five minutes of arriving she’d already decided, “I ain’t going back to England”, and was using her new catchphrase to describe everything.Hamburgers  “Next level.” Hollywood Hills mansions  “Next level.” The Beverly Wilshire hotel  It’s next friggin’ level. She seemed to have her priorities right, though.Before going anywhere near a green card applicationshe got pretend friend Jonathan Cheban to take her to cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Doctor Simon Ourian: “Because I want a facelt while I’m here.How long will I need ” How long have you got, Gemma  It’s next level.FINAL word on Celebs Go Dating belongs to ­brilliant narrator Rob Beckett.Lauren Goodger: “Everyone’s, like, ‘Did you find love, did you meet anyone ’And I’m, like, yeah I did.

And theof greatest ever breakfast television duo Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid to GMB.Cos I don’t mind telling you, I’ve really missed the hoary old cricket anecdotes, that unfeasibly small yet hyperactive mouth and all three of those le-insurance-risk chins. And Piers as well. IF this fth series of Peaky Blinders achieves nothing , then Irish actor Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson’s attempt at a Scottish accent has certainly highlighted the problems of frictionless borders.Back and forth it pings between Dublin and Belfast.With the odd stop-off in downtown Hyderabad, before settling at something closer to Hercule Poirot Belgian rather than the leader of a depression-era Glaswegian razor gang thug he’s meant to be.It has a knock-on effect as well. Notice one thing that’s wrong with the show, you’ll probably notice everything  as well.Like the fact it’s all over the place historically, Paul “Arthur” Anderson is over-acting so badly the estate of Yosemite Sam should sue and Helen McCrory doesn’t look foxy dressed up as Janet Jackson. She just looks ridiculous.Underneath all that baggage and the obtrusive soundtrack, there is, I think, a serviceable enough plot involving Oswald Mosley, the IRA, the UVF, even though they weren’t formed until , and all sorts of carnage involving gypsies and Glasgow’s infamous Billy Boys gang, which our friend Brian Gleeson attempted to put into sharp focus at the end of Sunday night’s episode.“Zo, Tummy ­Shell-beee, it’s wuuuurgh yur wunt, it’s wurgh you zjall ’ave.” No, me neither.THIS week’s winner is BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Beaker from The Muppets.Compiled by Graham WrayJONATHAN Ross, in , to producer Andy Davies, on the subject of his -year-old neighbour: “I think you should, just for charity, give her one.”Jonathan Ross, in August , to Judge Rinder, on the subject of Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s disparaging remarks about Emmanuel Macron’s we: “I’m team Macron.It’s the most pathetic and most misogynistic thing they could say. It’s pretty awful, it’s pretty horrible really.”Jonathan, you’re a helluva guy.Sink Or Swim, Arg: “I’m going to be the plus-sized Michael Phelps.”And for all those wondering what the technical term for that is, it’s Michael Feltz.LIKE most of you, I watched a lively old bird called Judith serenade four sets of shrivelling male goolies with a chorus of The Lord Is My Shepherd before taking all of her clothes off on Wednesday night’s Naked Attraction.Then I switched over to Newsnight, where arch-Remainer Paul Mason was discussing Brexit and, I promise you, he sounded about a thousand times more unhinged. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Having invested £, in the disused building, the couple were set to leave their lives in Yorkshire and head to Galloway, Scotland. Andy and Jeanette , whose story is told on tonightaposs episode of Grand Designs, had planned to knock it down and build a £, dream home in its place. As the showaposs name would suggest, the couple had big plans for the remote plot of land.    Jeanette, an interior designer, and her husband wanted to build a three-side box with long stretches of glass window that would peak out of the grass. Gail force winds, pounding rain and the inevitably spiral of costs would quickly get in their way however. We found ourselves trying to put the roof on today with a force  gale blowing in our faces, explained Andy, from beneath layers of sodden waterproofs.    Itaposs been raining all day and itaposs a real problem. You can see all that dark in the sky over there and when that hits, the wind is going to go from mph up to  or  mph. Itaposs going to hit us in the next two minutes so I think we need to abandon this decision and get downstairs. In the ferocious conditions it took two weeks just to complete the first layer of the super strong roof.    While the roofers were hammering the structure into place, below them ferocious waves were smashing into the rocks at the bottom of the clf. The wind is still howling when they get to the most delicate installation - the glazing, Kevin McCleod, the shows presenter, explained. In one nerve wracking scene a group of high-viz clad builders are shown precariously carrying a large sheet of glass costing £, in total.    As they stagger across the yard a large gust of wind blows into the face of the sheet, causing the men to stumble momentarily. If they were to drop the glass, Andy admits, they would end up in hospital. At the end of the daring build the couple had invested £, in the project.

In June, , passenger Felicity Baker tweeted easyJet about Captain Bradley saying: Please tell your Captain Mike Bradleywho just flew me home to London from Copenhagen that heaposs a legend.

Stand up – but not at the controls please – easyJet first officer Michael Bradley who flew the plane from Paris to Liverpool on Monday morning. His suave, brilliant, fluent, informed and amusing mid-air briefing was a tonic to all on board.    More importantly, it was an antidote to the usual piping, brain-numbing, pseudo-posh, Wirral-Scouse, semi-literate, part-read-off-a card cabin twaddle regular passengers so often have to endure. The following week reader Bill Brown from Billinge wrote to the paperaposs letters page to talk about his experience of flying with the pilot. The letter was published under the headline aposDashing pilot Bradleyapos and said: I don’t agree with his comments usually, but he was spot on about easyJet pilot Michael Bradley. My we and I are regular passengers on the Malaga route and last month we had the pleasure of him flying us home. All the passengers around us were laughing and talking about his excellent commentaries. So much so, we asked the hostess to pass on our thanks to him. When we landed, he asked to see us and let me take a photo of him. So to suave, dashing officer Bradley, thank you for making our flight a fun event.

It is your parents and family - the way you have been brought up and accustomed to as a young man, which is chaos and violence.     Ambe was sentenced after being found guilty last month of causing grievous bodily harm with intent for the attack in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, in February. Judge Michael Kay, sentencing, slammed Ambeaposs parents for his upbringing and said the case had been a story of our times. You have been involved in a world of violence. Your violence is escalating. You pose a high risk of harm to others and the risk of further offences is imminent. It is because you know of no other world. You are a very angry young man and when you are angry, you turn to violence. You are a story of our times. A probation services report showed Ambeaposs risk of danger to the public was one of the strongest the judge had ever seen. Prosecutor, Simon Wilshere, said Mr Stevens was attacked with a machete or large kne on  February. He was with a friend in Abbots Langley when a moped ridden by Ambe appoached them. All three knew each other and didnapost get on. They started to run as soon as they saw Ambe, but Mr Stevens slipped. He got up and ran between two vans, but slipped again, Mr Wilshere said. He fell onto the grass verge. Che Ambe started attacking him with a machete or a similar weapon. He was hit some six or seven times as he was curled up on the ground, trying to defend himself.

Comerford deliberately hogged the parking space he shared with his neighbour in the y battle. The man, who runs an architectural design practice, claimed he had right of way on the pairaposs shared drive in Salford, Greater Manchester, when he began building works on his £, house. The project saw numerous work vans attending outside Mr Charnockaposs home next door and whilst the workmen agreed to move their vehicles upon request, Comerford kept blocking the space with his own car so his neighbour could not access to his house, located at the end of the driveway.    And in the -month feud, Comerford blocked the pathway on  dferent occasions, making it impossible for former lawyer Mr Charnock to park outside his property. But Comerford was convicted of harassment after Mr Charnock and his partner Michelle Lynch kept a record of the disruption. The businessman must now complete a -month community order,  hours unpaid work and pay £ in costs and surcharges. He was also issued with an -month restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Charnock and his partner unless through a lawyer. The order states he cannot cause obstruction and interfere in any way direct vehicular or pedestrian access to and from the Charnocksapos address.    In a statement read to Manchester Magistratesapos Court, Mr Charnock said: This whole series of events including the legal proceedings has taken a lot out of me but it was bad enough that we felt we had to. It has caused me constant stress when your nearest neighbour wages a war of attrition against you. It is particularly stressful when his behaviour stops you gaining access to the outside world and you feel trapped in your own home. Some of his behaviour has been disturbing and he has demonstrated an underlying obsession. It seems he holds an underlying and worrying hatred for us. Since we got the police and courts involved he has shown no contrition at all. We expect the outcome of this to remedy the situation and prevent further incidents in the future. And punish him for his offending over several months. Comerford denied causing his neighbour harassment, but was convicted following a two-day trial.  Zoe Earle, prosecuting, said: This defendant pursued a course of harassment against his neighbours Mark Charnock and his partner Michelle Lynch. Over the last  months the defendant stopped them from accessing their home address by parking across a road they both share. This was the only way the victims could access their home. Both parties initially viewed it as a civil issue but matters eventually escalated and the police became involved. The defendant during this period deliberately blocked access to their home in a way that stopped them getting access to their home. He parked his vehicle in front of their gates in an attempt to upset them. It got to the point that the victims struggled to cope with the harassment. Both struggled to cope with every day le. The victim has had signicant stomach pains. He was referred to a specialist and they thought it may be cancer but turns out it is an ulcer he feels is related to the stress caused by this. Comerfordaposs lawyers argued the matter wasnapost a criminal case.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge aposs second child started at Thomasaposs Battersea this morning , looking slightly shy but very excited as she walked through the front door with her parents and big brother.William told Helen Haslem, head of the lower school, that Charlotte, who is fourth in line to the throne, is very excited to be starting. According to a royal expert, George is very protective of his sister and will definitely show her the ropes when it comes to settling into le at the south London private school. Royal biographer Penny Junor told Hello magazine: Prince George is a very protective and lovely older brother.    Iaposm sure heaposll look after his little sister and take great pride in showing her the ropes. George started at the school in  and is said to be doing very well there, so itaposs easy to see why Kate and William decided to send Charlotte there too. They are also both regulars on the school run, so having both kids at the same school will make things a lot easier for them in the mornings.  George and Charlotte are said to be very close, so weaposre sure it will be a comfort to them both to have each other at the same school.And according to a source their relationship is even more important as playdates with other non-royal children can be tricky .They said: They are close in age, and they spend so much time together. Playdates [with outsiders] can be tricky, so they learn to lean on each other. However there are dferences between the two kids, and Charlotte is more outgoing than her reserved big brother. The Cambridges arrived at the school by car as other parents dropped off their children at the south London school.  Charlotte looked adorable dressed in her brand new unorm, a navy and red jumper with a matching skirt. She was wearing white ankle socks and traditional black school shoes.

The little royal was dressed in Thomasaposs Batterseaaposs navy and red unorm as she walked through the gates this morning holding her mumaposs hand. She arrived with mum, dad and big brother Prince George, who is already a student at the £,-a-term private school in London. The Cambridge family were greeted by Helen Haslem, head of the lower school, and William told her his daughter was very excited. Glamorous Kate looked thrilled to be accompanying her little girl on the first drop off.   Charlotte played with her ponytail as her parents shook hands with Ms Haslem. As they walked William told Ms Haslem: First day - very excited. Kate said: How are you  Did you have a nice summer  The four-year-old has been attending Willcocks Nursery in Kensington since last January but sheaposs now making the exciting jump to big school with her brother.Sources told the Daily Mail that George is excited and proud to be showing her around. His sister will be known to staff and schoolmates as Charlotte Cambridge.The Cambridges will be entitled to a discount for having a second sibling at the school, with annual fees reduced from £, to £,.    A small group of the media were invited to take photos of the special moment this morning. Charlotte was driven to school in south London by her father in the family’s Land Rover Discovery, arriving just after .. She was driven up to a side entrance while other children accompanied by their parents went in through the front. Charlotte arrived wearing what the school calls the transitional unorm of a blue pinafore with a white summer blouse, black shoes and white socks.Her arrival was a low-key event, recorded by a small group of journalists, in contrast to the crowds of photographers who turned out for Prince William’s first day at school when he was dropped off by Diana, Princess of Wales. William and Kate took Charlotte to her classroom to meet her teacher and settle her in.She is in a class of , one of three reception classes in her year, and will start by doing half days.  Itaposs an extra special day for Kate as she was forced to miss Georgeaposs first day at school in . The Duchess was pregnant with Prince Louis when George started at Thomasaposs and was suffering from  hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe and sometimes le-threatening illness which affects mums-to-be. Instead William had to take him by himself. George is said to be doing very well at the London school and heaposs reportedly just treated like a normal kid, so itaposs hardly surprising that Kate and Wills decided to send Charlotte there too. An insider told  Vanity Fair : Heaposs very popular and has lots of friends, and thereaposs very little fuss made about who he is.  Either William or Kate do drop off, and they are always very friendly. William particularly loves to have a chat with some of the other parents and he works out with some of the mums at the Harbour Club after drop off. Heaposs very chatty and amiable. The parent also says that George has been given a cute nickname by his classmates - PG. There is also another friendly face at school -  their cousin Maud, the daughter of Prince Michael of Kent’s son Lord Freddie Windsor, who is in the same year as George. After Kate and Wills wave Charlotte off, she will join her new classmates, sit down at her new desk and get started with the private schoolaposs packed curriculum - which includes some very exciting subjects . In her maths lessons, Charlotte will improve her counting and learn how to do basic addition and subtraction. She and her classmates will also learn about shapes, space and measurements.  In reception, the kids at Thomasaposs will be taught the link between sounds and letters so they can begin to read and write. Staff use a systematic, synthetic phonics approach to reading. For PE, Charlotte will get to try a number of new activities and sports. These including gym, games and ballet. They will also be taught about healthy eating choices and why exercise is so important. Children will have one French lesson a week which will be a wonderful introduction to the language. The schoolaposs website states: We believe that the Early Years Foundation Stage is fundamental in instilling positive dispositions towards learning. In the Reception year children will play and explore make choices and learn to have a go and persevere be creative and solve problems form good relationships be safe, secure and happy. A stimulating environment, including a multisensory outdoor play area, supports the teachers’ planned activities and the children’s own initiatives for learning.

The violent event unfolded when a man in a high-viz yellow jacket rang on the door of a detached house in Luton, Bedfordshire at .am on Monday.

She is then punched and dragged through the hall into another room.    Responding to her screams, the girlaposs -year-old grandmother rushes to the door and is swtly assaulted by the man. A dog can be seen running up the stairs in terror. The screaming abruptly stops and the man drags the unconscious body of the older woman into the dining room. He does the same to her daughter, slinging her across the floor by one arm and as she cries out, the man strikes her in the face and tells her to shut up. A voice upstairs can then be heard calling out, the young girl cries out: Thereaposs a person! The voice replies: What person  The girl replies: Help! Hurry up thereaposs a person.    Another young woman in a pink top then comes running down the stairs only to be met by the delivery driver who runs and seemingly throws a punch at her. The ordeal ends when the family are ordered into the kitchen. The victims, a Chinese family who do not wish to be named, posted the video online in a bid to help track down the attacker.One family member posted a plea for people to help find the attacker on Facebook , offering a £, reward. They told The Sun that the -year-old girl is being treated for fractured bones in hopsital.   The older woman, who was knocked out cold, has internal bleeding, she claimed. All he escaped with is two old-school Hi-Fi disc players, the family member told the paper. He does not take anything valuable he just hurt  them. He was brutal.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStephanie Bolam admits she often raises eyebrows among other parents on the school run with her full body tattoo. But her inking is only one of the unusual things about the -year-oldaposs parenting style. Stephanie lives on a boat with her seven-year-old daughter, Lola, on the River Thames close to Battersea. She is also an accomplished rock climber and mountaineer who’s introducing beloved her Lola to the art of wall-crawling. And passionate all-girls biker club member Steph is helping Lola excel at off-road ‘enduro’ motorcycling - at an age that would horry most parents.    But Steph, who is a model, said Iaposve always been super active and my dad took me out climbing and sailing at a really young age. But I actually started taking extreme sport much more seriously after Lola was born. Parenting and adventure is a weird contradiction - on the one hand you become more sensible and respectful of your le when you become a mother. But on the other hand, I wanted to take back control of my le having been pregnant and given birth. Lola and I now ski together, we climb together and we ride motorcycles together off-road. She goes for hours and hours.    Thereaposs always a few people who say, ‘wow, Iaposd never let my kid ride a motorbike’. Many people know someone who’s been injured while riding a motorcycle. But Lola’s not riding on a road, and because of the family she’s being brought up in she’s always likely to end up riding a motorcycle anyway. It’s so much better to learn how to ride at a young age, and in a safe environment, so that she has long-term skill-set. If she ever wants to ride on the road, that’s up to her. Next year she can have a bigger bike and start competingshe wants.    And for me, riding off-road is certainly no more dangerous than introducing a child to riding a bicycle. Steph walked away from her job as a City analyst to co-found her own clothing brand, Filthy Cute London. As well as being a member of the VC London female motorbike collective she is also a passionate runner and endurance athlete. In March this year she took part in the ‘Mongol ’, an epic  mile long ultra-marathon across a frozen lake in northern Mongolia, where temperatures can dip below minus - degrees C. That event is the brainchild of Rat Race Adventure Sports - and Stephanie is now a ‘test pilot’ for that firm, running ‘recce’ missions to prepare the routes before they’re opened to the general public.    Steph said: I really needed to find something extreme and sporty as part of my daily le, and that wasn’t going to take time away from Lola and see me heading to the Alps every other weekend to go climbing. I can’t just go to the gym - that’s just not going to happen. I needed a mission, something to train for. And that’s how adventure racing began for me. Before the Mongol , I’d never even run a marathon before and I didn’t really take the training seriously until six months before the event. For me, it was the hardest thing Iaposve ever done. But I absolutely loved it. “It wasn’t competitive at all and there were no egos. Everyone just wanted the others to achieve what they wanted.    The support of the people around you was incredible. It was super emotional, and an amazing feeling. Next up for Stephanie is a Rat Race ‘test pilot’ trip to Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago between mainland Norway and the North Pole. It’s a land filled with ice, glaciers, tundra - and potentially deadly polar bears. Steph, also an accomplished sailor, will be among a team of pioneers who’ll attempt a four day ski traverse of this barren landscape. She said: Svalbard is a place I’ve always wanted to go and I’m fascinated by wilderness areas that people don’t tend to go to.    This is a really wild place where you’ll really feel like part of an adventure. And, of course, there are bears to contend with. We’ll have special training to deal with any issues they might pose and some of the team will have weapons in case of any emergency. After Svalbard, I’ve also got a crossing of the Namibian desert on my wishlist. A blazing hot desert will be a nice contrast to all the frozen destinations I’ll have been to. The first thing anyone notices about Stephanie is her ‘full body suit’ tattoo, which took almost four years to complete.    Steph said: “The school run mums are quite used to me now. Lola goes to a fairly small school around the corner from where we live, and I think people in London are generally pretty open-minded, interested and intrigued by my body art. It’s noticeable that when I visit other cities I get a lot more looks! Some people do feel entitled to have an opinion, which is fine. At the end of the day I’ve got something that’s visible on my body and that’s very dferent to others. But art is theatre. It’s there to give people something to think about. And I don’t mind that at all.    Meanwhile Steph admits that introducing Lola to the world of adventure hasn’t always been plain sailing, particularly when it comes to rock climbing. She said: We’ve had some bad days and good days. And it’s hard when you take your kid climbing outdoors.

The mercury will drop to single figures across the country as bitter winds move south from Iceland today and Friday. But the mercury will reach C and above on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday in London next week, according to the BBC . Conditions will remain cool until then with the chance of an early winter frost this weekend, according to the Met Office . There will be lows of C this morning and highs of C this afternoon. Conditions should be sunny for most of the country today, although there will be heavy showers in Scotland.    Oli Claydon of the Met Office said: “Thursday and the start of Friday will see conditions remaining unsettled, but the showers and wind will die out by Friday evening. “High pressure is moving in, which means clear skies and a northerly air flow, bringing a particularly chilly night. “Saturday and Sunday arrive with the potential for a widespread frost.” Downpours will move south of the border tomorrow, hitting Wales, north, north-west, north-east, east, central, west, south, south-west and south-east England. The weather should improve on Sunday as most of the country enjoys sporadic sunshine, although the mercury is not expected to reach above C. Monday promises to be a washout as light showers affect nearly the whole country and temperatures drop to a maximum of C. Tuesday is also expected to be a relatively chilly day, with cloudy conditions. A spokesman for netweather.tv said: High pressure continues to build in from the west on Thursday, bringing a mostly dry and bright day for many, with winds lighter in the south.    But still windy in the north, with a warm front pushing east bringing a band of cloud with some patchy rain across Scotland and northern England for a time. Still on the cool side for early September, temperatures reaching  to C, though slightly milder across the north-west. The spokesman said low pressure will wash across the North Sea on Friday, sending cooler temperatures and rainfall across the UK. They added: The weekend will continue the cool theme, with winds blowing down from the north on Saturday between low pressure to the east and high pressure to the west.

Right now, boss James McPake must be scratching his head about that.Against Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup, his men came within a whisker of beating one of the country’s top teams.In the league, though, it’s been a dferent and worrying story. For  minutes in their opener they were in danger of being swamped by a Dunfermline side whose movement and pace they seemed to have no answer to, before rallying in the second half to earn a draw.If that first-half showing at East End Park was a warning future such lapses would prove costly, it was not heeded.After just over half-an-hour of the derby they were right in the game, maybe even a touch unlucky not to be ahead, but the loss of four goals in  minutes left them battered and badly bruised.With so many changes needed over summer, the early weeks of the season and even within games, that inconsistency was going to be a problem.However, Dundee were hammered by United and, given the quality of player they have, however new a team this is, it was an unacceptable outcome.It should also be said not many teams suffer the kind of beating the Dark Blues did against United and finish a season at the top of their league.Just one win from four games has to have Dee fans worried.Turning things round is going to take character. The one big hope they might be clinging to at the moment is that’s something their manager has in spades."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"tayside pharmacy workers strike looks set to continue","story":"A pay dispute between pharmacy workers and NHS Tayside looks set to rumble on.The disagreement relates to what Unite the Union describe as a “flawed job evaluation process” which leaves some workers on a “lower grade than they should be”.Union members have been striking since August  and say they had hoped for a resolution after an independent  was established to evaluate the current system.However the union has now claimed this process has now collapsed and have branded the process an #utter farce#, and members say they plan to continue their walkout into next week.Susan Robertson, Unite regional industrial officer, said: #From day one NHS Tayside has tried to wriggle out of their commitment to an independent process at every opportunity.

Scott is obviously disappointed that he is not going to be playing in these qualiers as they are two great games.“It would have been two brilliant games for him to go into.“However, I think the good thing is that when Steve took the Scotland job on he played Scott in the first two games.“He sees Scott as part of that .”The hamstring tear suffered at Kilmarnock was the latest injury setback to marr McKenna’s international career.The centre-back suffered a hamstring tear against Rangers in the opening game of last season that ultimately ruled him out of action for six weeks.That injury saw him miss Scotland’s opening UEFA Nations League clash against Albania and the friendly with Belgium last September.McInnes believes the recent injury was particularly cruel for McKenna as he was in good form despite the speculation over his Aberdeen future.McKenna had submitted a transfer request days before the English transfer window closed on August  for Premier League and Championship clubs.Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers both had bids for McKenna rejected before he handed in the request.Sheffield Wednesday came in with a late bid on transfer deadline day that was also rejected for the defender who is contracted to Pittodrie until .McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance have been very strong. Unfortunately he missed spells of football last season with two hamstring injuries and this is another one.“This is a similar injury to when Scott over-stretched itagainst Rangers here making a blocking tackle.“He has over-stretched it again having lost his footing on that pitch and is out for the region of three to four weeks.“It may be a bit longer, maybe a bit shorter, but Scott has been a quick healer in the past.”Devlin’s call-up came  hours after histo the Dons starting line-up for the first time in six weeks after a hamstring injury.McInnes said: “It just shows you need that squad and how it changes because Mikey thought he was not getting into my team a couple of weeks ago.“Mikey is now in charge of he jersey and he comes back in now and plays.“We know we can rely on Mikey when he is called upon.“It is great to have that quality in the squad to call upon when you have injuries.McKenna is one of five centre-backs ruled out of Clarke’s Scotland squad with John Souttarand Stuart Findlayboth omitted with injuries.Grant Hanleyand Liam Palmerwere called up but dropped out with injuries.In reaction Clarke called up the Dons’ Devlin, , and Hamburg’s David Bates, on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.Uncapped Devlin was previously in the squad last November and was set to earn his first cap only to suffer an ankle injury training with Scotland that would rule him out for three months.McInnes said: “What looked like an innocuous injury when he was away with Scotland saw him miss the best part of three months.“He missed out on the League Cup final, playing for Scotland and a number of key games for us.“For a young lad he has a lot of injuries to deal with but hopefully he will have better times ahead.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45044973-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"don devlin urged to take scots chance","story":"Aberdeen defender Mikey Devlin was today urged to make the most of his unexpected Scotland call-up for the Euro  qualiers against Russia and Belgium.Uncapped Devlin, , was called into Steve Clarke’s squad just  hours after his first game action for the Reds in six weeks.Devlin’s start in the - defeat of Ross County at the weekend was his first Dons game time since sustaining a hamstring injury in the - defeat of RoPS on July .Scotland assistant Steven Reid insists the late call is an opportunity to show his international credentials that he must grab.Reid said: “It is not ideal when you have members who would have been in the original squad and they have to pull out for ious reasons.“At the same time it is an opportunity for those who do come in.“An injury or another reason to pull out of the squad at club level as well means there is an opportunity for someone to come in and take their chance, and that’s usually the case.“It is quite rare you get an opportunity through some other reason – usually it’s an injury orsomeone is struggling for form and you have to take the opportunitycalled upon.”Devlin was drafted into Clarke’s Scotland squad along with fellow centre-back David Bates of Hamburg, who is on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.The call-up arrived on Sunday.The defensive duo were called in after Norwich City’s Grant Hanley and another Wednesday player, Liam Palmer, pulled out through injury.Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna was ruled out of the Euro  Hampden games having suffered a hamstring tear in the - draw with Kilmarnock.McKenna is set to be out for up to three weeks.Centre-backs John Souttarand Stuart Findlayare also injured.Devlin has been involved with the Scotland squad previously but has yet to be capped.Having recovered from a serious knee injury sustained at former club Hamilton that ruled him out for a year, Devlin’s form for the Dons earned him a maiden call-up to the international squad last November.He was set to earn his debut cap in the UEFA Nations League ties against Albania and Israel under former boss Alex McLeish.However, Devlin suffered an ankle injury while training with the international squad in the build-up to those qualiers.That ruled him out of the ties.

It can ultimately lead to an infection that is characterised to a large extent by diarrhoea, cramping and pain, fever and nausea. In the most severe of cases, C. dficile infection can be le threatening or fatal. vw, px\"  Patients with a C. dficile infection can often be successfully treated with antibiotics, however, there is a high risk of the infection ing as the underlying microbial imbalance that allows C. dficile to prolerate remains untreated.When patients suffer from multiple recurrences, this has a signicant impact on both their quality of le and on the NHS.Medical treatments that restore ersity in the gut microbiome could be the best option for patients suffering from hard-to-treat infections caused by gut-dwelling bacteria.To date, the most successful of these treatments is FMT, with cure rates of % reported widely across the medical literature. Indeed, FMT has been approved by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellencefor recurrent C. dficile. vw, px\"  To capitalise on the growing clinical demand for FMT and in response to the evident absence of an off-the-shelf and ready-to use product for use in FMT, EnteroBiotix has established field-leading microbiome collection, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, which include an active donor registry, a controlled stool donation facility and fully integrated Good Manufacturing Practicecompliant stool processing facilities.The company holds two regulatory manufacturing licences from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency , the UK’s executive agency which is responsible for ensuring that medicines work and are acceptably safe.Collectively, these capabilities and licences have enabled the company to distribute its first-generation novel medicinal products to doctors across the UK and Europe and serve patients with serious unmet clinical needs.Looking forward, the ambition of the company is now evolving beyond its initial concept.Indeed, the exponential growth of research into the microbiome has now linked imbalances in the gut microbiome with intestinal diseases, ranging from acute infections caused by C. dficile to more complicated chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.The impact of imbalances within the gut microbiome may even reach other parts of the body, with studies linking imbalances to diseases of the brain and nervous system such as Parkinson’s, Autism Spectrum Disorder and multiple sclerosis.In response, the company has quadrupled its workforce, secured several rounds of substantial investment . It is now actively developing its product pipeline with a view to realising the full therapeutic and clinical potential of its products. vw, px\"  The company’s ongoing commitment to realising both its therapeutic and research ambitions means that it is constantly looking to recruit healthy stool donors to capture healthy bacteria. The company is working hard to dispel the taboo and overcome the obvious mental barrier that can be associated with donating stools.It has established a tried-and-tested donor screening and donation process that while comprehensive remains simple and easy.The company would like to hear from iniduals who are:To find out more and explore the possibility of becoming a stool donor, please contact its donor manager Claire Kidd at donors@enterobiotix.

Front line staff are working hard to provide care in very dficult circumstances, but care in the community can only workproperly resourced by senior management.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of the decisions to sht care away from centres such as hospitals are as much to do with saving money as the genuine best interest of patients.In times of recession it is, once again, the most vulnerable in society who bear the brunt.The rain is teeming down as this is being written, but last weekend saw sunshine and crowds in Tarbert.The atmosphere was fantastic for the seafood festival, and there is no doubt the weather helped in a big way.Congratulations to the small band of organisers for another great weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"red star take derby spoils","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star welcomed local rivals Tarbert to the joint campus, and it was the Lochgilphead side who maintained their place at the top of the group thanks to a Stuart MacLean goal early in the second half.The first half of the game on Saturday August  began at a typically fast pace as you might expect from a derby clash-  but both sides were limited to efforts from long range which goalkeepers John Martin and Ally Lewis dealt with relative ease.The home side started to enjoy more possession as the first half progressed but were finding the well-organised Tarbert defence dficult to breach and were limited to efforts from distance which failed to trouble Martin in the Dookers goal.Star came out quicker at the start of the second half and looked to play at a much higher tempo. The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment.

At that time her father was employed as an English teacher at Marr College, later transferring to the village school of Scotlandwell in Perth  Kinross.The family moved to the Borders when Mr Baxter took up the post of schoolmaster at Bowden School, eventually rising to become Director of Education for Roxburghshire County Council.The family set up home at Lindean, with Helenrsquos brother Sandy later taking over the running of Lindean Farm. Both siblings attended Lindean School, before moving to Selkirk High School.Helen undertook her basic nursing training at Edinburghrsquos Dean College, then studied for her midwery qualication at Bellshill Maternity Hospital, Glasgow. From there she headed to Jersey to serve as a midwe on the island, before ing to the Borders in the early s.In November, , she married Harry Russell, who earlier that year had been appointed Selkirkrsquos Royal Burgh Standard Bearer.

Another finding from the research was the high levels of DNA from land-based species in the loch, including humans, dogs and farm animals such as sheep and cattle.DNA from wild animals such as deer, badgers, foxes, rabbits, voles and multiple bird species was also found.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

So the teammade a conscious decision to use all the meat from the carcase, specically the prime cuts, in thesausages and burgers and it has made a huge dference to the taste and succulence of the product. Why not have an everyday product with the best ingredients The pork meat is available all year round giving customers a steady supply of their staple shopping and this is then boosted with seasonal lamb, game and beef. When theygo to the markets people just love the story of the farm and that theycan basically point to the field where the animals are being reared.The flavours and dferent products have been created in collaboration with thelocal butcher and theirrange of wild venison is sourced from local estates, shot by a member of the Scottish Deer Society.Springfield Game and Country Meatsare looking to develop flavours without detracting from the flavour of the meat and product, you donrsquot need to hide quality.

Wersquore not falling for that trick ndash no way Jose. Asking for an election was just Boris Johnson trying to use democracy to get off the hook, said Labour and the LibDems.Jeremy Corbyn may have spent the last two years demanding ldquoa General Election now, but he didnrsquot actually mean ldquonow, according to Labourrsquos Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Tony Lloyd, on Newsnight. He meant: ldquoonly when the Opposition parties choose it. They want to stop No Deal first by mandating the Government to ask for an extension of Article .:Brexit: Boris Johnson to seek election after Commons defeatNow, the original objection to the election, as with the prorogation, was the threat that Mr Johnson might cunningly schedule the campaign to last beyond Brexit day, on October , thus forcing the UK out when Parliament is not sitting. That would have been outrageous. But even the offer of an election on October  ndash two and a half weeks before Britain is set to leave ndash seems to be unacceptable to Labour or the Tory rebels. Or at least most of them. There were many contradictory statements yesterday, as Parliament went into meltdown.You can understand why many Labour MPs might want to delay an election. A lot of them would lose their seats for a start. Mr Corbyn is thought to be a closet Brexiter, so maybe he doesnrsquot want to risk the possibility that Labour might actually win, leaving him with the poisoned chalice of Brexit.All Opposition MPs relish the prospect of Mr Johnson, who said he would leave the EU on October  ldquodo or die, being forced to go cap in hand to Brussels to ask for yet another extension to Article , as ordered by the Extension Bill. Butthe Tory rebels stay strong today, and the bill becomes law, could Parliament really order the Prime Minister to do something he has repeatedly promised not to do Outside Downing Street on Monday, Mr Johnson said there were ldquono circumstances in which he would ask Brussels for a delay. But it would be the law of the land, chorus MPs and commentators. He would just have to do what hersquos told by Parliament. But it isnrsquot quite as easy as that. You can take the PM to water, but can you make him drink He could refuse to give the Extension Bill what is called ldquoQueenrsquos Consent, because it interferes with royal prerogative ndash the right of governments to conduct foreign affairs, and sign treaties. This has been used by Prime Ministers before, Labour included.The similar Cooper-Letwin Bill, last March, didnrsquot require Queenrsquos Consent because Theresa May accepted it. Indeed, she went ahead and requested the extension of Article  before the bill had finished going through Parliament. She wanted an extension to avoid no deal. Mr Johnson doesnrsquot, so he could refuse to let it become law.Alternatively, he might just note the Extension Act, and then noty Brussels that,the EU  agree to an extension, he will not cooperate. He could just empty-chair the whole process, as he did the TV debates during his leadership election. Or he could attach unacceptable conditions over budget contributions. The European Union does not negotiate with inidual MPs or with parliaments ndash it negotiates with the governments of member states. Would the  EU countries agree to extend British membership under such a recalcitrant, delinquent PM Mr Johnson would argue that the constitution is on his side. If the Commons keeps him in office, and by not supporting a confidence motion, it would be reaffirming him as the Prime Minister, then he has to act according to Government policies. This would be an absurd situation of course. A demeaning spectacle.:What the papers say about Boris Johnson and BrexitIn times past, when a PM lost on a key plank of government policy, he or she would simply resign and call an election. This was what James Callaghan did after he was defeated in . But because of the Fixed Term Parliament Act ndash passed by the Cameron coalition in  without thinking through the consequences ndash the Prime Minister cannot actually call an election. Mr Johnson has to win a two-thirds majority in the Commons.Labour appears to be saying that it would vote to keep him, pro tem. It wants the Extension Bill to be law before there is an election, to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of October. But the idea of a Prime Minister being forced to act, as it were, by an alternative government based in Parliament, is not something our constitution can handle. The Westminster system is based on the assumption thata government has no majority for its actions, it ceases to be it is a dead parrot. The Fixed Term Act allows the Opposition parties effectively to hold the Prime Minister hostage.The matter will probably end up in the courts. Remain groups already have their legal teams working against the prorogation and will roll that into an action claiming that the government is acting unlawfully. Willy nilly, democracy is moving from Parliament to the judges benches. Irsquom not sure this is a good thing.Whatever happens this week, there will have to be an election soon. It could destroy both the main parties. Indeed, after ex-Chancellor Philip Hammondrsquos claim that the Tory Party is being taken over by ldquoentryists itrsquos questionable whether the Conservative Party still exists. Conservative MPs are crossing the floor, like Phillip Lee, or leaving like Justine Greening.:Andrew McKie: Contradictions at heart of SNPs Brexit election strategyLabour isnrsquot in much better shape. It is hopelessly confused over Brexit, still apparently committed to negotiating another deal with Brussels before putting it to a referendum. In Scotland the party is facing virtual extinction.Perhaps thatrsquos why the prospect of a General Election before Brexit Day has become somewhat unattractive. As Oscar Wilde said, therersquos only one thing worse than not getting what you want thatrsquos getting it."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Late it is  indeed  but we can rejoice at this Booker choice","story":"Why the excitement  Well, where to begin  Ellmann, who lives in Edinburgh with her husband Todd McEwen, also a writer, is one of the most undeservedly under-appreciated novelists of our times. In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Local charity the Blide Trust put a lot of work into ensuring the gardens are kept up to a high standard and are a peaceful and welcoming place to relax and rewind in. Sadly, there seems to be an ongoing problem of anti-social behaviour in the gardens.“If people hear or see something and are concerned, please noty the police immediately.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

The motion was carried by  to  votes.As part of their Is Deontóir Mé Yes I Donate campaign, the family of West Belfast toddler Dáithí Mac Gabhann lent their support to the council motion as they geared up to mark the important week. “As it’s organ donation week, it gives us an opportunity to shout even louder than normalfrom our rooftop about the importance of organ donation.“We did the impossible on Saturday night by lighting up our beautul Black Mountain with ‘I Donate’ and this week is shaping up to be a pretty busy one in terms of raising awareness for our campaign and organ donation,” said Dáithí’s father Máirtín.“Dáithí will be welcomed to the Lord Mayor’s parlour on Friday and the DonateDáithí charity is the official match partner for the biggest game in Irish football this weekend with Cltonville against Linfield on Saturday. To finish off the week there will be our biggest ever Gaeltacht Quarter K with  people running in pink throughout West Belfast.“From we started the campaign we want to, and continue to, normalise the conversation around organ donation and this week gives us that ,” he said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"no transport as schools start back","story":"THE Education Authority has denied reducing transport services for special schools despite multiple complaints from parents who say there was no transportation available for their children this week.Parents with children at Fleming Fulton, St Gerard’s and Longstone schools have hit out at the Education Authority, after being informed that transport had not been arranged.Áine Steenson, has been in touch with the EA since July regarding transport for her nine-year-old daughter, Caitlin, who was due to start at Fleming Fulton on Monday. On Friday , Mrs Steenson received a call informing her that no bus was available due and mix-up between the EA and the transport provider. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs Steenson said she had “issue after issue” during the summer months due to their errors.“My experience of it is that the Education Authority has a lot of people off sick, they are understaffed and there is a lot of pressure, and there just isn’t enough transport places available for the kids that need them. There are children being let down, and for us personally, it’s just not doable. We both work, and it’s an hour-and-a-half to get down to Fleming and back up again, so to do that while working and bringing our other child to school is impossible.”She continued: “This week we have been very lucky that my work has been flexible and allowed me to take some times, but that’s not sustainable. I hope that her transport can get organised very very quickly so that she can go to school. We have prepared her for going on the bus or getting in a taxi and she’s wondering why it’s not happening – it’s confusing for her.”She added: “I don’t know what we’re going to do. It’ll be very stressful. There’ll probably be days where she can’t make it in because we can’t get transport. I might have to take more time off or my husband might have to.”Despite complaints from parents, the Education Authority has said there has been no reduction to transport services.A spokesperson for the Education Authority , said: “EA provides transport assistance to over , children every day, including , children with Statement of Special Educational Need.“We remain committed to ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place ahead of the new school year.“In this case, EA’s transport service provision has been maintained and there has been no reduction to services at either school.

In many respects, we have finally arrived at a moment of truth for the country,” he wrote.“It is my judgment that pronouncing myself publicly in the midst of the debate that is ongoing at Westminster would not be appropriate, even though my attitude has always been to work in an objective manner, based on facts and the law, together with the UK, to find solutions for the consequences of Brexit.“My regret in having to postpone this lecture is amplied by the work done by researchers at Queen’s University.

He added the imminent prorogation of Parliament poses \"real dangers\" in terms of Northern Irelands governance, and asked when Mr Smith was consulted about the matter. On the Governments plans to legislate for direct rule in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Lloyd asked: \"Does the Secretary of State accept that some form of direct governance, some form of direct accountability, would be necessary in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and can he tell us what steps hes taking \" Mr Smith replied: \"I think Ive been very honest with the House - powers are needed, not only to ensure the current situation where civil servants across Northern Ireland are making dficult decisions without political direction, but obviously in the run-up to either a deal or no deal that the very tricky decisions can be made and Im sure those will have to be made at pace.\" On legal advice for prorogation, Mr Smith said: \"Its not something I or my department was involved in. That was a matter for the Attorney General.\" Ms Bradley expressed concerns about the impact proroguing Parliament may have on the people of Northern Ireland. She said: \"Can you ensure that while prorogation is in place, Government does not stop working for those that need redress, and by that I mean victims of historical institutional sexual abuse and those that were severely physically and psychologically disabled in the Troubles through no fault of their own  \"They need redress, they need it urgently.\" Former Tory minister David Gauke said powers are needed to protect the people of Northern Ireland and the Commons needs to be sitting to legislate for those powers. He said: \"Is it not clear thatthis House does not get the legislation through because it is prorogued or dissolved by the end of October that the rights of the people of Northern Ireland will be detrimentally affected \" Mr Smith said the priority is on getting Stormont up and running. Mr Lloyd called for a \"clear statement\" that there will be time to discuss the issues before prorogation so the Secretary of State \"has the power to do the things that Northern Ireland needs\". Commons Speaker John Bercow said the concern being expressed on both sides of the House \"will have registered very firmly\" with Mr Smith. He said: \"About this matter, more must be heard. I think we need to be absolutely crystal clear on that point.

The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

Johnsons first PMQs was choreographed madnessThere were fears the Bill could have been stalled in the Lords, with Labour peer and leading lawyer Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws accusing Tory peer Lord True, who had submitted a raft of amendments to the motion, of time-wasting.The Lords sat until .am on Thursday when chief whip Lord Ashton of Hyde said all stages of the European Union Bill will be completed by pm on Friday.   “We have also received a commitment from the chief whip in the House of Commons that Commons consideration of any Lords amendments will take place on Monday and it is the Government’s intention that the Bill be ready for Royal Assent,” he told peers.The late night debate capped a day of high drama in Westminster where newly appointed Prime Minister Boris Johnson was defeated over a backbench Bill to delay Brexit and a plan for a snap general election.Mr Johnson had called for a poll to be held on October  but Labour and other opposition MPs refused to back the bid – which needed a two-thirds majority in the Commons – while the risk of a no-deal remained.The Government failed to secure the support of two-thirds of MPs, with the Commons voting  to  –  short of the number needed.In a hint he could seek a further vote to force an election, Mr Johnson issued a direct plea to Jeremy Corbyn’s MPs as he accused him of being “the first Leader of the Opposition in the democratic history of our country to refuse the invitation to an election”.“I urge his colleagues to reflect on what I think is the unsustainability of this position overnight and in the course of the next few days,” Mr Johnson told the Commons.The Labour leader had said the Bill must be passed through the Lords and have received Royal Assent before he would entertain the thought of heading to the polls.He said: “Let the Bill pass and have Royal Assent and then we can have a general election.”These are friends of mine and believe me I take absolutely no joy in any of it but it was very sad and surprising that they should choose to undermine the UK’s ability to get a dealBoris JohnsonMeanwhile, Mr Johnson was facing continued criticism after Tory MPs – including two former chancellors and the grandson of Winston Churchill – had the party whip withdrawn because they rebelled by helping the effort to prevent a no-deal.The PM defended the move, telling ITV’s Peston: “These are friends of mine and believe me I take absolutely no joy in any of it but it was very sad and surprising that they should choose to undermine the UK’s ability to get a deal.”On Thursday, Mr Johnson has a busy schedule, including separate meetings with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and US Vice President Mike Pence in Downing Street."},{"url":null,"title":"hotel staff startled to find bear curled up in toilet","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He seeks a second term and what he calls a strong mandate to negotiate with the militant group on the country’s political future. Mr Ghani has rejected talk of an interim government, an idea that has gained such traction in Kabul that many other presidential candidates have barely campaigned.Mr Omer acknowledged on Thursday the risks of holding another chaotic election after the presidential one in  and last year’s parliamentary vote. He said the election must happen on time but said a vote that is not transparent will “cause challenges”."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures 39 wall wall sunshine 39","story":"Berriew Show President and grandfather, Mark Bright, presents cup winner in the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtover s fancy dress ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtto Olivia Jonesfrom Berriew.

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal. I am indebted for all the support I have received, particularly from my family, he said.Listooder Ploughing Society chairman Martin Gill spoke of his delight following the gala awards presentation.He said: ldquoTo go to the world contest for the first time, using borrowed equipment and to compete with the best in the world, winning a bronze medal and best newcomer title is a fantastic achievement.ldquoListooder has a long and successful history in ploughing. All three of our members who have competed at the world contest have all come home medal winners.In the reversible class, Hillsboroughrsquos James Coulter, who was also competing at the world contest for the first time, produced another fantastic performance.After finishing th on day one, James ploughed a fantastic plot the day after to win a bronze medal on grassland, finishing fourth overall and winning the best newcomer for the class.There will be little time for Andrew and James to celebrate as they prepare to compete in the Northern Ireland Championships at Cookstown this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin primary school opens new sensory garden  ","story":"CHILDREN, teachers and parents at St Maryrsquos Primary School, Aughlisnafin, celebrated the completion of a sensory garden and outdoor learning centre at the school with a barbecue and family fun night last Friday.The garden was officially opened by the school principal, Paddy Hardy, and Laura Brennan, chairperson of the schoolrsquos parent-teacher association.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service and the RNLI were in attendance to advise the children on fire and water safety.Another special guest was Down gaelic footballer Rory Burns, who took on the children in a lsquoBeat the Goaliersquo competition.The school staff got involved by raising funds with a lsquoSponge the Teacherrsquo event which was a highlight for the children.A total of pound, was raised from all the activities and the barbecue.The school wishes to Fresh Food Centre, Castlewellan, Finnegans Butchers, Castlewellan, and Eurospar, Clough, for their donations.The school also wishes to thank everyone who attended the event for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Ban.jpg","title":"Ban on circuses with live animals  ","story":"CIRCUSES using live animals will be banned from performing throughout the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.The move calling for the council not to grant entertainment licences to circuses using live animals was passed at Monday nightrsquos full council meeting.It echoes back to a previous ban enforced by the legacy Down District Council which prohibited circuses with live animals performing on council facilities.The notice of motion, tabled by Alliance councillor Patrick Brown, was supported by  councillors. The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again. This issue was actually raised in the Assembly as far back as  by my good friend Jim Wells MLA, who was very critical of the failure of Michelle OrsquoNeillrsquos Agriculture department to include such provisions in the Welfare of Animals Act .The councillor argued that some of the worldrsquos best circuses, such as the Cirque de Soleil, ddid not use any animals which ldquoreflects a global trend towards human-centered performances that no longer use animals, including the Russian and Chinese state circuses.He added: ldquoHopefully council will lead the way on animal welfare and pass this motion.The motion was seconded by fellow Alliance councillor Gregory Bain.Downpatrick SDLP councillor John Trainer, who also supported the motion said circuses did not provide a natural habitat for animals.DUP councillor Billy Walker, UUP councillor David Taylor and Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Willie Clarke all supported the motion on behalf of their respective parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28th August 2019 Border.jpg","title":"Border Cup set to start  ","story":"CUP action continues to dominate the local soccer scene with the countdown to Christmas joy beginning on Saturday.Thatrsquos when the first round of the prestigious Border Cup takes place with eight local teams in action.Top billing goes to the game at Robert Adams Park between Kilmore Rec and Portaferry.Other ties include Grove United v Killyleagh YC, Drumaness Mills v Greenisland, Holywood FC v Ballynahinch Olympic, Aquinas v Ballynahinch United, Comber Rec v Bangor Swts and Saintfield United v Bryansburn Rangers.

There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community.

Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant.

The new puffin crossing will address this issue at what is a particularly busy main street which is notoriously dficult to cross, even with the presence of the current crossing.Cllr Walker said people need to be able to bring traffic to a halt so they can cross in safety.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation.

It was agreed that a report, which would include how the fee was set within the framework of the council’s fee setting policy and the investigation process, would be brought to next month’s

We did not want to be seen to be overly pressing”.He is expected to fight again on November , his counsel added.A possible trial date in December posed problems surrounding the availability of expert witnesses including a specialist in accountancy, barristers told a review hearing in the Belfast court.McGuigan’s barrister Brian Fee said a January trial date gave more leeway for preparatory measures.He added: “If there is a new trial date it should be one that won’t be imperilled by any further delay.”The judge said he was keen to deal with the case and expressed willingness to postpone

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

out how much it costs  ","story":"Do you want to complain about a neighbour#s high hedge  It#s going to cost you five times more in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area.That’s £ - five times more than any other area in NI, says AllianceCllr Eóin Tennyson.Cllr Tennysonsays the Council must make it easier for people to deal with high hedges.He said: “As it stands, where mediation fails in dealing with concerns around high hedges – which can often be a real nuisance and source of frustration and stress for people affected – raising an official complaint in the ABC area costs up to five times more than other areas in NI.“Often people dealing with high hedge disputes have no choice but to make an official complaint, which is why it is dficult to comprehend why ABC Council insists on charging applicants £ – adding financial strain to an already stressful situation.“While the fee is ed to the applicantthe complaint is upheld, this is still a large outlay which can be prohibitive for residents seeking resolution to a problem that has often been lingering for some time.“The fee is set by Councils, so while in other areas like Derry and Strabane Council it costs £ to pursue a complaint, I must question why the fee is so excessive for people to access the same service in the ABC area.“That’s why we are not only calling for a review of the costs of high hedge complaints in ABC Council, but have urged officers to advance the development of a mediation toolkit or resource to help resolve a greater number of disputes at an earlier stage.”A Council spokesperson said: “The matter of high hedges was raised at this week’s Environmental Services Committee. It was agreed that a report, which would include how the fee was set within the framework of the council’s fee setting policy and the investigation process, would be brought to next month’s Environmental Services Committee.”Princess Charlotte arrives for first day of school - accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
