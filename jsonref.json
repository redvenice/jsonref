In total 65 pieces of artwork will make the short journey to the Queen’s Gallery for a year long display.They will be seen for the first time in a “gallery context … as you would see them in a picture gallery instead of a palace,” said Shawe-Taylor.“You can see them reasonably well in the picture gallery but it is still a palace … they are double stacked in a sumptuous interior, most visitors would be going for the whole experience of the summer opening. Many people would not be saying: ‘Oh I’m really looking forward to seeing the Dutch genre painting.’”From December, visitors will be able to enjoy close-up one of the only 35 Vermeer paintings in the world – The Music Lesson, a work far more sexually charged than it may seem. The female subject is playing the instrument but clearly looking at her tutor while doing so, while in the foreground is an aphrodisiac pitcher of wine.There will also be two “extraordinary” Rembrandts, including one which has long been said to be the Queen’s favourite painting: The Shipbuilder and his Wife (1633).“It is an absolutely spectacular painting,” said Shawe-Taylor. “Not just because of the effect of light and realism … I mean the flesh of the two elderly figures is rendered with extraordinary, palpable realism. But it is also a very tender, almost comic depiction of a relationship between husband and wife, so it’s got a very modern feel to it.”Whether it is the Queen’s favourite is for her to confirm. “It is always said,” said Shawe-Taylor. “I have no more inside information than you.”About half the paintings were acquired by George IV, a monarch usually remembered as unintelligent and who spent too much money, but also someone who had a good eye and a passion for art.It was George who commissioned the architect John Nash to transform Buckingham House in to the principal royal residence in the 1820s. Part of the scheme was the creation of a picture gallery to show off the king’s paintings.The 2021 show is a first. “In a way, we’re obliged to do it,” said Shawe-Taylor. “We’ve got to get them out of the picture gallery for the building work.”• Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace is at the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, 4 December 2020–January 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45262c8c41bf89599a1077894d4f64b73d3fd02/0_499_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=742215c14ce31a14d8799c789194fafd","title":"fawley waterside hampshire new forest power station cadland estate leon krier poundbury","story":"Despite the government’s new planning design codes, this New Forest ‘mercantile city’ development resembles a prissy Poundbury, at odds with its wild settingThe government calls it a “fast-track to beauty”. It means a set of rules, clearly stated by public bodies, about what constitutes good architecture. In the recent white paper Planning for the Future, it proposes that a development that follows these rules – or “design codes” – automatically gets planning permission. That way, a minimum standard of quality is set, without the kerfuffle of subjective argumentation that goes with committees discussing what is and is not beautiful. Which processes, to judge by the built environment we see around us, are not particularly successful.It’s an attractive idea. Georgian London and 20th-century Manhattan were built roughly along these lines, and they’re generally considered to be successful examples of city-building. The point is partly to make the process foolproof – a developer who follows these rules doesn’t have to be a genius at design to produce a tolerable result – and also to achieve a degree of coherence between different bits of building, and between old and new.Then the difficulties crowd in: how can you create a code that works for the many different characters of places not only across the country, but within counties and even inidual towns? How do you identify the aspects that really do make places successful? How do you avoid imposing an aesthetic tyranny in which the men from the ministry know best? How do you have enough looseness to allow for invention, without making the rules so loose that they’re meaningless?To get some idea of the future the government might have in mind, you can look at the plans for Fawley Waterside, a “mercantile city” of 3,750 inhabitants and 2,000 jobs, planned for the site of Fawley power station, a mighty but redundant 1960s structure in a mixed zone where the bucolic New Forest collides with the industrial edges of Southampton Water. The proposal is put forward by the Cadland Estate, which is the Wodehousean name of the large neighbouring landholding of Aldred Drummond, whose banking ancestors got rich financing George III’s unsuccessful attempt to retain the American colonies.Fawley Waterside, for all that it intends to attract tech businesses and their employees, doesn’t particularly look like the future, but rather a mixing of Regency terraces with traditional cottages that (according to the computer-generated images) come with actual thatch and real donkeys. This old look is the point: Fawley is inspired by Prince Charles’s model town of Poundbury in Dorset, which aims to apply traditional building patterns to modern development. The advisers behind the government’s enthusiasm for design codes like to cite the Duchy of Cornwall’s work among their inspirations.Léon Krier, the architectural guru behind Poundbury, also worked on Fawley. He resigned when he felt his ideas were getting watered down – including the rejection of his plan for keeping the power station’s 198-metre chimney, with a classical capital added, such that it would become the largest Tuscan column in the world. But the current proposals still have recognisably Krieresque aspects, in particular a close-packed, slightly irregular plan like that of traditional European cities.Different types of “grain” – by which they mean the density and scale of the buildings – are specified: “coarse”, “less coarse” and “much finer”, depending on the location on the site. Building height limits are set, except for some “mixed-use buildings of stature” – little towers that in the visualisations look weirdly Ruritanian, also like miniaturised versions of socialist realist landmarks in the former Warsaw Pact countries. Desirable window proportions are stated. At times the code seems to be a rather tedious guessing game, to which the correct answer is always “neo-Georgian”.The likely result of the admirable promises will be a much higher quality of development than you would get from the average volume housebuilder, and as with Poundbury its residents will no doubt like its traditional styling. Me, I find it clammy, plonky and prissy, and not meaningfully connected to the rather wild and anarchic environment in which it stands. I feel that the literalness of this kind of classicism gets awkward when handling advances in window technology since the Napoleonic wars, or the humane modern regulations about wheelchair access. And if Poundbury is anything to go by, there will be a lot of porticoes, arcades and verandas that look like agreeable gathering places in theory, but in practice are not.But then I’m not in their target market. What matters for the rest of the country is how codes can capture what might be good about new development of whatever style. This has a lot to do with tangible and unarguably beneficial qualities, such as minimum space sizes for rooms and daylighting standards. Those much-loved codes for London and New York were primarily to do with the practical issues of stopping fire spread and limiting overshadowing respectively, but they happened also to contribute to making successful streets and a memorable skyline.Using the codes to push up density would be a good idea, both to use land effectively and encourage walkable neighbourhoods. It might be nice to stipulate minimum standards of external materials. Most importantly, and most difficult, the framers of design codes will have to take on highways engineers, who as Matthew Carmona of University College London pointed out, still insist on space-eating road layouts that are miserable for children’s play or for anyone on foot.The government has called for a return to “pattern books”, which were once used to set out a limited range of house types for builders. As Carmona has also said, modern developers have their own ranges of standard types: the problem is that they are not very good ones. To find rules that really work will be a complex task, requiring resources and expertise. Let’s hope the government means to fund it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012b6b6880cc7974df5822df7559fa021bffce20/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec23219e5295951bc102e3c3158f4c7","title":"the big picture shadow play in 1930s germany","story":"Paul Wolff’s 1930s images of a tennis match in silhouette have a graceful life of their ownIn 1930, Dr Paul Wolff took a series of pictures of tennis players’ shadows for the German magazine Die Dame. The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Not for nothing is the book called Light and Shadow. Dr Paul Wolff \u0026amp Tritschler: Light and Shadow – Photographs 1920 to 1950, edited by Hans-Michael Koetzle (Kehrer Verlag), has been nominated for the Kraszna-Krausz 2020 Photography Book award.

About 63,000 sq km of this land is Wilinggin country of the Ngarinyin people and their connection to country dates back 60,000 years.One of the first stops towards Wilinggin country passes the Queen Victoria Head – a rock formation bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous monarch. While it’s a blunt reminder of colonialism, it’s also the gateway to an area that until very recently had far more dubious name – the King Leopold Ranges, named after the Belgian king responsible for grievous atrocities, brutal oppression and enslavement of African people.An estimated 10 to 15 million Congolese people died under his brutal regime. Leopold is a figure among many whose inappropriate immortalisation has been brought to the global stage by the Black Lives Matter movement.But after two years of work behind the scenes, traditional owner groups made some new headlines with a historic name change to the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. It’s a hybrid name to represent both the Ngarinyin (Wunaamin) and Bunuba (Miliwundi) traditional names.Since then, another seven places in this conservation park have changed back to their Ngarinyin name.Since the Wanjina Wunggurr Wilinggin native title determination in 2004, the Ngarinyin people have made significant moves to empower their community and return to, and care for, country. One of the first things they set up after determination was an Indigenous ranger program: the Wunggurr Rangers.Ngarinyin man Robin Dann was one of the first rangers employed and is now head ranger, living on country in the Ngallagunda community, with his family. His younger brother Kane Nenowatt is more recent addition to the Wunggurr rangers while his wife, Tanya Spider, sits on the Wilinggin board of directors.Dann’s granddaughters Anastacia and Lizinta Jumburra provide boundless energy and infectious smiles, but they also represent a new generation for the community.“These changes are about time, mate, but we always kept the names when we worked on country anyway – they never went away. But this does give us recognition and that makes us proud,” Dann says.One of locations changed back to its traditional name is (the formerly named) Barker pool, now Dudungarri mindi. The name refers to the dreamtime story of the Wanjina spirit and the Yawarlngarri jirri (blue catfish) which live in this pool. This represents a rich and ancient history that Ngarinyin people hope to share with visitors alongside the staggering beauty of the region.For the Wilinggin Aboriginal Corporation, this moment also highlights the benefits surrounding native title. With it comes a genuine economy: employment and investment brought to the region by the people themselves. With a second ranger group on the way, the determination of the Ngarinyin people to stand on their own is a shining light in an uncertain world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1178f9fdaee4872074e224ab3232727543f3ba33/0_0_2770_1662/master/2770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7314530f994420e3e8f44dc40a17625","title":"dont expect any more historical fiction from me says hilary mantel","story":"Writer tells Edinburgh festival audience she wants to focus on short stories and theatreHilary Mantel has spent the last 15 years consumed by Tudor intrigue and writing award-winning historical fiction, but fans should not expect much more in that vein.“I haven’t got another big historical novel in view,” she told the Edinburgh international books festival on Sunday. “I think that’s quite important to say, so I hope people will stop writing to me with suggestions. It’s lovely that people have the appetite for it but considering the pace at which I proceed, I would like some life before it’s too late.”It had been an all-consuming experience, she said in conversation with the ’s chief culture writer, Charlotte Higgins. “I will frankly say that the last three, four years particularly have been hard. I haven’t really had any break or downtime in between.”Her entanglement with Thomas Cromwell continues because she is involved heavily with a stage adaptation, hopefully to be put on by the Royal Shakespeare Company next year, and to a lesser extent with a planned BBC television adaptation of the third novel.She said she was “increasingly interested in working in the theatre”, with plans to disinter “my box full of scenes for other plays”.Mantel also wants to devote more time to short stories. She had ideas while she was writing The Mirror and the Light and scribbled things down for three hours before putting them in a box.She said: “It may be that none of them will work out. I don’t have a great strike rate with short stories. I often find they fall over and I have to abandon them, but I’d like to see if there’s any potential there.”Whatever comes next, Mantel said she was determined it would not be “some sort of mea coda” or “a sort of tailing off of effort.

Of course Oxford Street should be pedestrianised,” she said.Selfridges joins a swathe of brands from John Lewis and Ikea to Gucci that have stepped up their ethical profile.The department store is signed up to the Fashion Pact launched at last year’s G7 meeting in which more than 20 brands, including Gucci, H\u0026ampM and Zara’s owner Inditex promised to address their environmental impact.Brands are responding as growing numbers of young people turn to reuse and resale sites such as Depop in the UK, The RealReal in the US and YCloset in China. The second-hand market is expected to grow faster than fast fashion in coming years.John Lewis is launching a furniture rental service and is mulling a marketplace to sell used products. Laying out a new strategy for the business, which also owns Waitrose, its chairman Sharon White said last month: “The themes of tackling inequality, of wellbeing and sustainable living will be at its core. These have never felt so relevant, with the economic uncertainty and social inequality coming out of the pandemic.”Ikea has invested in renewable energy and mattress recycling, promising to phase out single-use plastics as part of plans to spend at least €3bn (£2.7bn) on sustainability from 2009.Chana Baram, a retail analyst at market research firm Mintel, said: “Since the pandemic happened, people have become far more aware of the processes of supply chains because all this has made the news in a big way.”She said the headlines highlighting poor conditions in a Leicester garment factory linked to online fashion shop Boohoo and reports on the treatment of workers in warehouses during the pandemic had put workers’ rights at the top of the agenda.She said these community concerns were part of a trend in more conscious shopping – sparked by David Attenborough’s BBC documentary series Blue Planet, followed by Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg – and had inspired protests on broader environmental issues.“People have high expectations now of what retailers should be doing,” she said. They could not focus on just one issue, such as plastics use, but had to work on all aspects of ethical business as well as they could.Selfridges’ Project Earth, was ready to launch in April but was delayed until this week because of the high street lockdown.The retailer is working with brands including Prada to promote recycled materials such as nylon made from plastics pulled from the ocean and more sustainable fabrics like organic cotton.Its resale service, called Resellfridges, will host a series of vintage collectors selling specially curated collections. After that, customers will be able to sell their own accessories for store credit.Selfridges is also launching its first collection for hire with specialist Hurr Collective. Pieces from more than 40 brands including Zimmermann and Emilia Wickstead will be available to rent for between four and 20 days.The company is also pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its stores and office by 2023 and eliminate waste by reducing unnecessary packaging.

In their last year of school, pupils apply for up to five courses through Ucas. Universities then decide how many deserve the offer of a place, based on how many offers are usually accepted and then matched on results day.It is a difficult task even in a normal year, yet the costs of getting it wrong are huge. If an institution under-recruits, it will have spare places, empty beds and financial problems. If it over-recruits, it will have overcrowded seminars, a worse staff-student ratio and discontented students, hitting league table positions.This year, the job is impossible to do properly. The exams were cancelled and, in their place, we have rough-and-ready results with sharp edges. A teacher relative of mine showed me data for one class at her comprehensive school. Everyone expected to receive grades A to C but, in the event, half received D to U.There is an appeals process, but iniduals cannot appeal directly and the grounds for appeal are limited, plus, where an appeal succeeds, it may be too late to get the university place you want. Universities want to help where they can and many will have spare capacity as international students stay away. Most want to ersify their intakes, but they are not free agents. The UK is meant to have the most autonomous universities in the developed world, yet, bizarrely, ministers have responded to the pandemic by imposing a system of student number caps on English universities, with big financial penalties for over-recruitment. Many challenges posed by the pandemic are the same across the world, but the UK’s university admissions round has one important difference. In two-thirds of European countries, living with your parents is the most common type of student accommodation. In the UK, eight in 10 full-time students leave home to study.Aside from the extra challenges in terms of social distancing, mass residential education encourages a ersity and hierarchy of institutions. People don’t just look to their local institution but much further afield. When our university admissions system works well, it is like the Sorting Hat process at Hogwarts, finding the best match between person and place.This year’s school leavers have been told for years that the world is their oyster. They were told they would have a particularly wide set of options because they are, relatively speaking, such a small group. Apart from 1976-78, 2001 and 2002 were the only years since the Second World War when fewer than 600,000 babies were born in England and Wales – those babies are today’s 18- and 19-year-olds.So they had been expecting unprecedented choice, with universities falling over each other to recruit them. This year was on course to be the least painful admissions round in living memory. But it is instead a terrible time to be leaving any educational institution: no school proms, no normal exam results and no freshers’ weeks. This is encouraging all sorts of wild predictions about the future. Some say the results mess shows why we should move to continuous teacher-led assessments rather than putting all our eggs in a basket labelled “public exams”. Others say the era of big physical university campuses will end as online learning takes over.Those children are now itching to go away as planned. After all, you do not just go to university to study, you go to get away from home, make new friends and journey to adulthood in a secure environment. This is particularly important this year, after so long spent in the claustrophobic atmosphere of lockdown. That is why, against many of the predictions, more young people, including more disadvantaged young people, have secured a place in higher education this year. And they want a traditional university experience when they get there, ideally alongside other students because they know learning is a social endeavour.A traditional experience won’t always be possible, due to social distancing, but universities want to provide it. They wouldn’t have built up such vast physical presences if they had wanted to be virtual institutions. Real, as opposed to online, lectures and social events will return as soon as they can. In the meantime, a bigger concern than entry rates is likely to be drop-out rates. New students will be less well prepared than their predecessors, having generally done no school work since March. They could also find it harder to integrate, as freshers’ fairs and social events are postponed or cancelled. They won’t all survive the distance.In moments of doubt, new students should recall that higher education generally works out, with graduates tending to earn more and live longer. But the journey is not always smooth, so institutions are putting in place more online and face-to-face support for those who need extra help or have second thoughts – and accessing this should be recognised as the act of bravery it is, rather than evidence of being a snowflake.Before anyone does drop out, they should remember that, even if their initial year of university life is disrupted, it is the least important one, academically and socially. As Evelyn Waugh put in Brideshead Revisited, you may even “find you spend half your second year shaking off the undesirable friends you made in your first”.• Nick Hillman is the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95ece22368a0b412c41f133061de0b02e4aaaec8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a2cc77be291aea427fb51cedbd99b","title":"news britain covid local communities tories","story":"Covid proves that local communities need power and a sense of place. So why are they being pushed in the opposite direction?Last week, as the government announced the reshaping of its dysfunctional test-and-trace operation, one of the biggest lessons of the pandemic was once again made plain. First, reports said that the current centralised, privatised call-centre operation was to be cut back by Sunday, the chosen term was “wound down”. Expecting any clarity from the people in charge is clearly a mug’s game, but what looks definite is that getting flashpoints of infection under control is now to be fundamentally overseen by local councils. Reluctantly, it seems, ministers are starting to acknowledge that the anti-Covid effort – which is still too top-down – will only work effectively if it is rooted in communities.The fact that whole swathes of basic administration are best handled at the local level is a banal insight that has eluded British governments for decades, and so it has proved again. For all that we are encouraged to think of the pandemic as a national issue, all outbreaks are essentially local – and like extreme weather events, they demand effective on-the-ground action and communication, and the kind of strong institutions that affirm people’s sense of place and solidarity. After a decade of cuts to local services, Covid-19 has cruelly highlighted the importance – and lack – of both. It has crystallised a question that goes beyond matters of politics and government into some of the most basic ways that places function: if the coronavirus has proved that doing things from the grassroots up is so crucial, why are so many aspects of our everyday lives being pushed in the opposite direction?Last year, I wrote about drastic changes to local commercial radio, and the broadcasting giant Global getting rid of around 60 local breakfast and drivetime programmes, remodelling local news bulletins, and closing studios in places such as Chelmsford, Kendal, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon. Now, the radio company Bauer is folding almost 50 local stations into a national radio network branded Greatest Hits that will carry programmes made in London. To meet the demands of licences, a smattering of non-national programming will continue, but will be regionally produced rather than falling to inidual local stations. In the midst of an ongoing emergency that demands as many information outlets as possible – not least to advise about local lockdowns and what they entail – the gap between these moves and the most basic notions of social responsibility is obvious.And this is only one small part of the story. A month ago, the BBC confirmed that it was cutting 450 jobs from its regional news operations. Weekly current affairs programmes will no longer be made in Nottingham, Salford, Tunbridge Wells, Southampton and Plymouth. Meanwhile, the demise of local newspapers continues apace. Reach, the UK’s largest publisher of local and regional news, is shedding hundreds of jobs. Last week, it announced the end of the Lichfield Mercury and the Sutton Coldfield Observer in Wales, another company is shutting the weekly Glamorgan Gem, which publishes different editions across six communities. More than 245 British papers have closed in the last 15 years in the US, the scale of extinction exceeds 1,800 titles.There is an urgent conversation to be had about the demise of print publishing, and how to bring local journalism to new audiences: the recent arrival of dozens of local news websites – in places from Falmouth to Crewe – which trade under the brand of Nub News is encouraging, but there is still far too much scorched earth. Again, the pandemic throws everything into sharp relief. If social media is awash with misinformation – much of it local chatter – and national politicians have now decisively moved into the realm of Trumpian mendacity, then whatever guarantors of fact people can access are precious. Clearly, the demise of local media makes the search for truth even more difficult.What is often missed in accounts of these changes is the way they dovetail with the process of austerity. First, crucial foundations of anywhere’s sense of place come under attack: libraries, youth clubs, community centres. When local media closes, the capacity to present those changes to people and hold those responsible to account shrinks, often to nothing – something seen recently in the serious claims that nearly half of the UK’s leisure centres are in danger of closure, and the fact that such a jaw-dropping prospect seems to have barely sunk in. Something comparable applies to the newly accelerated decline of high streets, and our mounting jobs crisis. Even if big things happen, they increasingly appear as dull and unarguable as the weather.Here and elsewhere, the 21st-century human condition is perhaps reducible to living far too quietly and fatalistically – something that came to mind when the government announced its proposed free-for-all on new housebuilding. Visit the new residential developments that now ring so many towns and cities, and you will see our increasingly rootless, anonymous, nondescript way of life frozen in bricks and mortar. The houses are sometimes nice enough, but these confounding tangles of avenues and crescents have little sign of any shared amenities aside from tiny play areas and the odd retail development. Quaint street-names, usually chosen to create the impression of a heritage that never existed, only further the sense of somehow being nowhere.Now, as the decline of local journalism means that building proposals get far too little attention, the government wants to sideline the role of councils in the planning system. The promise is of a rapid building boom that will use design templates redolent of “Bath, Belgravia and Bournville” to deliver housing “that is beautiful and builds on local heritage and character”. But anyone who has watched what has happened to British housing will know what is surely coming: more and more Unplaces, in which community and collective purpose are beyond people’s grasp because the physical means to create and sustain them simply do not exist.Ministers are set to get rid of section 106 agreements, the arcane-sounding provisions – named after part of the 1990 Town and Country Planning Act – that often compel builders to include affordable housing in their developments, but also to make contributions to parks and public spaces, local education and community centres. Whatever small sense of shared experience and inclusion in the wider community that exists in new-build developments is frequently dependent on these things. But along with the community infrastructure levy, section 106 deals are to be replaced by a nationally determined charge for developers that is already the focus of alarm and scepticism. Given that their whole thrust is to speed up housebuilding and free developers from supposed red tape, it is not hard to see where these moves point: to places made up of cookie-cutter housing, and very little else.Here, perhaps, is our hyper-inidualised future, to be accompanied by a national soundtrack beamed out of the capital: no sense of place, no dependable local news, no spaces to gather – nowhere, indeed, to organise the kind of collective self-help that has recently been revealed as many communities’ last line of defence. In what looks set to be an age of disruption and disaster, we could not start from a worse place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce152ee573bcb038529759bd0df33dae05a38486/0_0_3810_2286/master/3810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6ec5f76b1645f5f39428d0538e9137","title":"the guardian view on lebanons blast a cabinet resigns a system must go","story":"Without meaningful political change the country could slide into sectarian strifeDays after an enormous explosion tore through the city of Beirut, leaving at least 170 people dead and thousands injured, Lebanon’s cabinet last week resigned. It might have been an opportunity to end a sad chapter of the country’s history. Protesters have been on the streets since last October, angry at official corruption, mismanagement and spiralling inflation. With the politicians resigning en masse, this was surely a turning point. Unfortunately there appear to be many more sad chapters for this tortured nation to endure.Lebanon’s tragedy today is that it is caught between Iran and the US, a standoff which saw the UAE and Israel – former foes – draw closer last week. Iran backs Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist political party and a US-designated terror group, which has become a pillar of the Lebanese state by weaving a web of multi-sectarian alliances.The “Party of God” has been part of Lebanese coalition governments for more than a decade. It is also Israel’s most potent adversary. Previously Hezbollah lurked in the background, allowing rivals to run the government but able to intervene at crucial moments. When demonstrations brought a new government in January, Hezbollah was firmly in charge. This meant it could be blamed for the state’s dysfunction, which it can do very little to fix. With the suspicions that it stored weapons near the site of the explosion, the Tehran-backed group will struggle to retain its dominance.Lebanon’s confessional-based political system lies at the heart of its dysfunctional governance. Based on a French colonial-era power-sharing agreement and reinforced by the 1991 Taif agreement which ended the country’s 15-year civil war, seats in parliament are shared out proportionally among the country’s 18 religious groups. Public sector jobs are ided up among sects. This system ought to have disappeared within the first parliament after the civil war ended.But Lebanon’s political parties had no interest in dismantling the system of patronage. They use ministries to dole out jobs to their followers. Lebanon’s political system relies on foreign powers, which back local proxies. Syria ran the country, with tacit US approval, until its 2005 withdrawal – which was sparked by assassination of then-prime minister Rafik Hariri. This week a UN-backed court in the Hague is to deliver its verdict on four men, linked to Hezbollah, tried for his murder.Hariri’s death should have been the spark for real change: national reconciliation between communal groups and, as the Taif accords envisaged, the establishment of a parliamentary body to end Lebanon’s “confessional” democracy. There needs to be a process of reform. But Beirut is hunkering down, enacting a law that gives the army sweeping powers while demonstrations rage.The Lebanese, who host 1.5 million Syrian refugees, ought to decide their government. They are rightly angry: rolling blackouts, food shortages and soaring prices mar their daily lives. Aid to deal with Covid-19 is needed. More US sanctions will be self-defeating. New elections might help. But voting carried out using the current system favours incumbents.One demand from the protesters is, before any new election, for the electoral law to be changed to a non-sectarian basis. That needs the current caretaker government to cede power to a more representative one. Something must give, and it would be better for the Arab street to be heard. As we saw in neighbouring Syria, a civil non-sectarian movement can morph into deadly sectarian strife. That is a chapter of Lebanese history nobody wants to write."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/123b6dbc20309b0c456cbe9d979ad2aedbe79ac5/0_51_1594_957/master/1594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8668f0ab32220612ac142d17e39cc4be","title":"the names bond second best bond","story":"In a world racked by disease, it’s lovely to debate which actor was almost as good as Sean ConneryThe subject of who is the best James Bond is a difficult one on which to be interesting. As you’re about to find out. I really meant not to write about it but I couldn’t resist, simply because I find it so interesting. I reckon that’s probably why it’s tricky to be interesting about. Increasingly I think, when it comes to the risk of being boring, that’s the red flag: are you finding yourself interesting? If so, no one else is.Bores are seldom themselves bored – they’re usually finding themselves fascinating, banging on about wiring, or gardening, or what people don’t understand about Charlemagne or who’s the best Bond. So, listening to a bore is like an offensive metaphor for global wealth inequality. The bores (representing the super-rich) droning on, becoming more and more interested, as everyone else gets more and more bored, until all of the world’s interestedness is in the possession of a tiny number of droning people, while the vast majority must scratch an existence in unremitting stultification.But being boring is really enjoyable if you can find a nice supportive environment to indulge it in. The scourge of mansplaining is well-documented, and I’m absolutely first in line to take everyone through the various issues with that, but explaining things can be deeply relaxing. Anecdotally at least, it feels like something men do more than women, but that doesn’t mean men do it exclusively to women (as the bishop mansplained to the actress). Some of my most peaceful evenings in the pub with other men have involved hours and hours of taking it in turns to explain things – just saying some facts that probably everyone listening already knows, so that they can nod and then it’s someone else’s go. It has the same comforting quality as muttering the Lord’s Prayer or assembling an Airfix model.Discussing which actor’s portrayal of fictional spy James Bond is most accomplished is right in the “thy kingdom come”gluing-on-a-Spitfire’s-landing-gear sweet spot. So, in a world racked by disease and mega-explosions, last week’s news that Sean Connery had won a Radio Times poll to decide the best Bond was lovely to read. It was relaxing and uplifting in the same way as turning on ITV on a random afternoon in the 90s to discover that Moonraker is on and you haven’t missed the bit where the gondola turns into a hovercraft.The poll is of course totally unnecessary. Everyone knows Connery is the best Bond. Statements to the contrary are only ever made as a means of asserting personality. People sometimes find the refutation of obvious fact useful as a means of defining themselves in a group. Like citing a link between the coronavirus and 5G, these aren’t really opinions, but aesthetic choices by which people can stand out from the crowd without the necessity of doing anything difficult or good.It must be a source of some bewilderment and sadness for the producers of the Bond films (as well as for the several talented actors who followed Connery in the role) that the relatively unknown former milkman and bodybuilder who first landed the part in the face of scepticism from, among others, Ian Fleming turned out to be the only person who can quite make it work. Balancing Bond’s suavity and brutality while remaining sympathetic, and also responding plausibly to circumstances of extreme jeopardy, while remaining cool but not becoming smug, is virtually impossible.Everyone else erred in one direction or other: Roger Moore is too suave, Timothy Dalton too stressed, Pierce Brosnan too groomed, Daniel Craig too depressed and George Lazenby, with the best will in the world, made it look like they’d accidentally rolled camera on the stand-in. But Connery got it right first time and made it look easy. It’s taken half a century of other actors failing in order to properly contextualise his achievement.I don’t blame those other actors. James Bond is a ridiculous character – a pathetic mixture of dandy, narcissist, twat and thug – but in the stories’ universe everyone thinks he’s ace and we’re not supposed to think that’s because they’ve all gone potty. The job of playing James Bond is to make all the punching, screwing and fastidious drink-ordering seem cool, likable and real and only Connery managed it.So the real issue (and I know it’s my round and I’ll go to the bar as soon as I’ve just made this one point) is who is the second-best Bond and here, I must say, I take issue with the structure of the Radio Times survey. This was not done as a straight vote but as a series of rounds, with Connery taking on Craig in round one, then Brosnan versus Lazenby in round two, Moore against Dalton in round three and then a final fourth round between the victors of the first three to decide the overall winner.Well, you don’t need to have been in charge of seeding for a Wimbledon championship to see the problem. Craig against Connery in the first round! That effectively eliminates Craig’s chances of coming second overall, which, as anyone but his agent would say, is his absolute best hope. Connery should be seeded one and face Lazenby in the first round, Moore and Craig should be seeded two and three, or three and two – maybe do it based on box office adjusted for inflation – and should take on Dalton and Brosnan in rounds two and three.Then if everything went according to seeding, Connery, Moore and Craig would all make the final and we might get an answer to the only significant remaining question: do people prefer Roger Moore’s dapper charm or Daniel Craig’s craggy-faced verisimilitude?Perhaps it’s time to give The Living Daylights a serious re-evaluation, finger hovering over the pause button and notebook and pen at the ready. This is intriguing. I’m so sorry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a930d7dfc326c23790e20a56830ea36f61bbd79/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f80106416f0c9d0d169c48b197c05d6","title":"naomi campbell it is time to reset the supermodel relishes a moment of change","story":"The world’s greatest supermodel has been a fearless champion of ersity in fashion for decades. Now she’s relishing a moment of changeAn upside of our new Zoom-operated civilisation is supposed to be the abolishment of lateness. It’s harder to justify when the commute is from your bed to the living room. Unless you’re Naomi Campbell, of course. Twenty minutes into waiting for her to join our call, a message pops up from a representative apologising that she’d be a few minutes late. Another 20 minutes and I’m told she’s “just working out how to sign in”. I’ve been expecting the wait, comparatively tame compared to the tales of four-hour stake-outs I’d heard from other journalists.And then, suddenly, she enters, and the atmosphere changes even in a virtual room, international accent first and then the face that launched 1,000 covers skin dewy and glowy, goddess-like impossibly high cheekbones and honey-blonde highlights. “Hi,” she says coyly. Polite but unapologetic. It’s fascinating to witness in real time this acute awareness of her own mythology an unspoken agreement with anyone she encounters that she will be operating according to her own time zone.The scene is made all the more surreal for me by how locally her story started. Naomi grew up in Streatham, south London, and attended Dunraven, a school that’s a bus ride from the house I currently sit in and is best known for the hood-famous disstrack Fuck Dunraven, penned by an excluded pupil. It’s difficult to conceive of a time Naomi Campbell was ever “from ends”, occupying a level of fame often reserved for black American juggernauts: Michelle Obama, Serena Williams, Oprah Winfrey. She’s easily the most famous black person in Britain and one of the most famous people in the world full-stop – meeting her feels like facing the final boss at the end of the Black Girl Magic hashtag. When I met her at the Fashion for Relief launch last year, people actually congratulated me.“I don’t think about the word ‘fame’,” she says, when I bring this up. “I really just feel that I’m me. I’m just Naomi. And that’s it.”Still, being “just Naomi” means being fashion royalty since puberty, a muse to the likes of Azzedine Alaïa and Karl Lagerfeld, a supermodel of the early 90s alongside Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and others. She, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington famously formed “The Trinity”, who now quaintly share a WhatsApp group.“They really put themselves out there, Linda and Christy, in terms of supporting me with designers back in the day who hadn’t used a model of colour yet,” she says. “We were friends outside of work.”Indeed, it’s well known the pair once famously told Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana: “If you don’t take Naomi, you don’t get us.” Racialised sidelining would be a theme in her early career, though her impact on the fashion world was near instant. Naomi started modelling at 15, in 1986, and covered British Elle just before her 16th birthday. Two years later, she became French Vogue’s first black cover girl. By 1989, two more covers: the first British black model to front British Vogue, and the first black model to cover US Vogue’s most distinguished edition of the year, the September issue. In January 1990, she was declared “the reigning megamodel of them all” by Interview magazine.These career highlights were not without difficulty. In a recent Woman’s Hour interview, she recalled crying at the sight of her 1988 Vogue Italia cover because of her “grey” makeup. The makeup artist didn’t have her shade, he said, because he didn’t know she was black.“Now it’s OK to speak up, right?” she says. “But when I spoke up when I was younger, I was ‘difficult’.”There was similar strain in the lead-up to her French Vogue cover, which came about after her friend and mentor Yves Saint Laurent threatened to withdraw his advertising from the publication if they continued to leave black models off their covers. Still, she does witness breakthroughs. Last year, she noted that her  Weekend cover marked the first time she had ever worked with a black photographer “on a mainstream publication”. This year, she had her first black photographer for a Vogue publication. She finds it galling that these are still milestones to pass.There’s still a great deal to celebrate in terms of her own history making. This year, she became the first ever face of Pat McGrath Labs makeup line, launched by the renowned black British makeup artist in 2015, who Naomi has known for over 25 years. At the height of quarantine, she appeared on the MayJune cover of black magazine Essence in celebration of both their 50th birthdays. She did her own hair, makeup and styling for the shoot, capturing the images on her iPhone.This ability to adapt is as integral to brand Naomi as her signature strut – she has managed to stay generationally relevant at the forefront of an entirely trend-led industry. Gen Z have come to fall for a more motherly iteration, affectionately dubbing her “aunty”. She laughs, properly now, when I ask how she feels about this new appellation.“I don’t feel old,” she assures me. “Even when I was called aunty 10 years ago. I’ve never felt old. I find them sweet!”This shift was solidified in July last year by a viral YouTube video of her inflight sanitising routine, depicting levels of both hypochondria and clean-freakishness that immigrant children know well (her choice of Dettol as cleaning agent reminded many a Tweeter of their Jamaican mum). “Clean everything you touch, anything that you could possibly touch,” Naomi instructed fans, wiping down the TV screen, pull-out tray, remote. She finished off her pre-Covid precautions with a pair of gloves and mask, which made her pandemic-era upgrade to full hazmat suit and goggles a whimsical but logical leap, and one the internet lapped up.Years ago, she dominated headlines for very different reasons. In 2000, she pleaded guilty to assault after throwing a phone at her personal assistant. Seven years later, she pleaded guilty to assaulting a former housekeeper. She arrived for community service at a New York City sanitation garage in a glittering $300,000 Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana gown, a move that was panned by the press as petty – the very reason her legion of younger fans love it. Other controversial examples from her past live on in gifs. Naomi taking the witness stand in the “blood diamonds” trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor is immortalised in a meme often used to display eye-rolling disbelief. It is captioned: “She’s reaching, your honour.”“I’ve seen some of the memes,” she shrugs. “They make me laugh. I only recently figured out how to send a meme. Someone sent me one and I was like, ‘How do you do that?’”The youth celebrate the hedonistic Naomi suspended in 90s decadence alongside the matriarch they now know from No Filter with Naomi, her YouTube show, where she interviews fashion innovators. Her first foray into reality TV was as a coach on modelling competition The Face, where she frequently cut contestants down to size. A filter has not been added for her YouTube channel, nor for Amazon’s Making the Cut series, on which she is a judge. But she says young models appreciate the tough love approach. She’s taken a number under her wing, such as Anok Yai and Adut Akech, who has referred to her as a “second mother”.“I’m bossy and motherly,” Naomi says. “And I don’t want to see my babies go in the wrong direction, if I can say, ‘Don’t do that, do this.’ I don’t put my nose in, but if I’m asked, I’m going to give my opinion. And when they come running to me, I’m gonna pamper them.”With a career ning decades, she prides herself on having seen it all, the peaks and troughs of ersity, black falling in and out of fashion. At the moment, things seem to be moving in the right direction. Virgil Abloh is one of the most sought-after designers. Olivier Rousteing became the first black designer to run a major Paris house when he took over at Balmain in 2011, aged just 25. Gap recently inked an apparel deal with Kanye West. Fenty is the first fashion brand launched from scratch by LVMH since Christian Lacroix was founded in 1987, making Rihanna the first woman of colour at the top of an LVMH maison. Much of the ersity we see with models now, Naomi notes, she lobbied for with Bethann Hardison and Iman via the platform Diversity Coalition. “Now I want to see them pay models of colour in the right way,” she says. “Now I want to see that the board seats are given, and no: ‘Let’s make a ersity board for this.’”As the Black Lives Matter movement continues to create change, there is also a touch of cynicism about the now-vocal voices that were silent when Naomi decried a lack of industry ersity before it was deemed “in” to do so. “I’m sticking to the people that I’ve spoken to before,” she scoffs. “I’m not trying to jump on any new bandwagon. So, now we’re allowed to speak up? We weren’t allowed to before – who’s given the permission? I’ve given myself the permission – if I feel a certain way and I’m in a situation that I don’t think is right, I’m gonna speak it.“I understand that a lot of people didn’t want to then, or thought, ‘If I do, am I gonna lose my job?’” she continues. “I get it. Listen, better late than never. But I have not changed in this aspect, in terms of what’s going on in the world now, from how I was 15, 20 years ago.”It is this consistent push for change, paired with past mistakes, that’s made her such a compelling figure. Decades of charity work have been at times obscured by scandal. In 2005 she set up Fashion for Relief, a catwalk show and auction that’s raised millions for various charities. Last year, she was awarded the Fashion Icon award at the Royal Albert Hall in London for her contributions to the fashion industry, as well as her philanthropic work. The honour reduced her to rarely seen tears. “I learned today that I’m the first woman of colour to receive this award,” she said in her speech, voice cracking. And, of course, there’s her ongoing work in many African nations, supporting everything from infrastructure to women’s rights, a love affair that started in South Africa in 1993 and saw Nelson Mandela name her his “Honorary Granddaughter”.“I just love the people, love the vibe” she says. “It’s just been a continent that’s just been ignored and only cared about for their resources. What about them as the wonderful people that they are?”It’s more likely now than ever. After the launch of the chart came the Disney + release of Beyonce’s long-anticipated Black Is King album, which pays homage to Africa’s erse cultures. It features artists from across the continent. Campbell herself appears in the Brown Skin Girl video, alongside Kelly Rowland, Lupita Nyong’o and her mentee Adut Akech. The album has elicited largely positive reactions, though the Chicago rapper Noname wrote it off as “an African aesthetic draped in capitalism”, and it has reignited But the so-called “diaspora wars” continue to plague online spaces.“Diaspora wars?” Naomi repeats, confused. I explain to her that it references the mainly digital infighting among the world’s black communities: African Americans vs Black Brits, Caribbeans v Africans, everyone versus Nigerians. “There’s no time for that,” she tuts. “In order for this to really work and grasp this that is our time, we have to be together. There’s no other way. There’s no time for separating. I’m not into that,” and she shoos the notion away with an elegant flick of the wrist. How could she be, when so many across the diaspora feel they have a personal stake in celebrating her success as theirs as a “Jamaican aunty”, as Mandela’s granddaughter, as the south London schoolgirl who conquered the world?Naomi Campbell: an updated two-volume portfolio published by Taschen at £100, is out now (taschen)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebec942dbc2928c4f5dc91fc7f69cae439112b9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a472e50990b597f1523311f37e1139c","title":"the edit kaftans in pictures","story":"Throw on a relaxed and stylish kaftan in a bold print or a classic stripe for a chilled day at the beach – or just for garden cocktails...

With a humorous nod to the less glamorous aspects of publishing life – hastily defrosted canapés and eked-out warm white wine – the author of One Day and adaptor of the Patrick Melrose novels has thrown a series of Twitter book launches, amplifying new releases from writers including (but far beyond) the big names who will automatically elicit review space and window displays. The responses from the authors, especially the debutants, to gaining the imprimatur of a much-loved and huge-selling colleague, and from readers to discovering books to connect with in a time of such immense disconnection, has been powerful and touching. It’s a particularly nice example of someone paying it forward.Nicholls’s virtual launches have been held every Thursday, the day new books are traditionally published in the UK, but this week’s will be his last. Quite possibly, his publishers have reminded him that the paperback edition of his own book, Sweet Sorrow, needs some love, or perhaps he wants to get on with writing another.It’s fortunate for him – although arguably less so for the world of books – that he’s bowing out before 3 September. On that day, in a development that has provoked anguish among booksellers, editors, reviewers and readers, almost 600 new books will be published, an increase of about a third from last year. There is such a thing as a crowded market, and then there is this: an avalanche of words that no retailer or media outlet could hope to accommodate. Even Waterstones Piccadilly, the chain’s flagship London store, is feeling the strain, one of the team writing on Twitter: “We are big and I doubt we’ll stock them all. No one has enough space for this.” They added: “We’ll do what we always do. Choose the books we think our Piccadilly customers will love most and those that we can honestly recommend.”Why the surge? Largely, of course, it’s the pandemic: with bookshops closed and literary festivals and events cancelled or significantly shrunk and moved online, publishers moved swaths of their publication dates to later in the year. Festivals are still in abeyance, albeit with virtual events, but publishing houses – and their authors, many in extreme need of their publication payments, which usually represent a third of their advance against royalties – had to do something. To shift entire programmes to next year, its landscape still highly uncertain, would be to kick the can down a highly congested road.But 3 September – just the first of a series of similar days throughout the autumn – is a problem. Waterstones Piccadilly has vast premises, but others – including the independent bookshops attempting to weather 2020’s storm – must rely on heavily curated selections and hard choices. For an industry that has suffered a series of shocks – including the collapse of wholesaler Bertrams, owing £25m to its creditors – autumn will be tough. For literary editors presiding over fewer pages for book reviews the issues are similarly intractable.As ever, certain realities prevail. It is implausible that the autumn’s big releases – which include Martin Amis, Roberts Harris and Galbraith, David Attenborough, Elena Ferrante, Caitlin Moran, Nick Hornby, Ant and Dec and Will Young, plus the cookery books that so often top the charts in the run-up to Christmas – will go under the radar there is simply too much marketing spend and, generally though not inevitably, too much public appetite for that to happen.And yet recent months have also intensified long overdue conversations about representation in publishing, and the need for radically overhauling both the systems and sensibilities that dictate who and what ends up in bookshops. Covid-19 has not created an arena in which writers of colour, working-class writers and writers living with disabilities have been marginalised and struggled to find an outlet for their stories, but it would be a travesty of publishing and bookselling’s core mission – to put the best array of writing in front of readers – if it were to make that arena even smaller. It’s not what the literary world’s most dedicated workers, who in better times turn out to eat their semi-defrosted canapés and chug their tepid Sauvignon Blanc with gusto – want or are working towards. Let’s hope the Super Thursday to end all Super Thursdays doesn’t drown them out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9eb4e2681c2bfa1c080cdde258367652c698f21/0_0_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02968dbb1f44bcd907a8474bbd94239f","title":"best thing i ate all summer chefs memorable lockdown dishes","story":"Chefs and food writers pick their memorable dishes in a season transformed by coronavirus. Standout moments: ice cream in Sicily and pizza from a secret vanI’ve never cooked as much as I have this spring and summer. Cooking has been sustenance, pastime, balm and escapism. I’ve shrugged off the reins of my usual Chinese habits and cooked more eclectically: Thai food, Sri Lankan curries, crumpets, quiche. But I think the meal that’s given me most satisfaction was a roast guinea fowl, prepared according to Judy Rodgers’ famed chicken recipe in the Zuni Café Cookbook.I fancied making something simple – forgetting that the recipe is five pages long and meticulous. The bird was pre-salted, sprigged with herbs, roasted in a hot oven and then served in pieces on a complicated, delicious bread salad made with green leaves, pine nuts and currants. On the side were boiled Jersey royals with tarragon mayonnaise and grilled asparagus. Finally, because Chinese thinking suggested something was needed to balance the richness of the other dishes and perk up the colour scheme, I made a salad of sliced pink grapefruit with chopped shallots, chives and olive oil.Roasting a whole bird rather than parts felt like a joyful symbol of the easing of lockdown, and the possibility of cooking for other people once again.fuchsiadunlopI’d been experimenting with dry-ageing duck, salting the breast, then leaving it in the fridge skin-side up so the skin gets very dry. I went into the garden at the Sportsman and picked white onions, a couple of handfuls of peas, lemon verbena and thyme that still had the flowers on. I pan-roasted the duck, and while it was cooking, sliced the onions and cooked them gently with butter and a tablespoon of water. I podded the peas, chopped the pods and added those to the onion trimmings and a little dried mushroom, and made a stock. When the duck rested, I added the peas to the stock and onions, with a little more butter, and stirred through the herbs and flowers. I put it in a shallow bowl, then sliced the duck on top. When you have fresh produce like that, the key is to cook things very gently: that’s all it needs for the flavours to shine. HO thesportsmanseasalterI’ve been cooking at home a lot. Let me first tell you about my failure. My son and I got interested in reproducing takeaways, because some of the offerings where we are in Devon aren’t great. We made a green curry burgers a kebab – and the bread to go with it. Our soup dumplings looked really good, but when I steamed them all the liquid came out. My son still liked them, maybe most of all, so it was all right. We’ve been buying fish and supporting local fishermen, as there were still a few people down here going out. Because my son really loves lobster, one Sunday we grilled one with herb butter and asparagus. Being locked up with a 17-year-old wasn’t ideal, but seeing his face as he ate lobster, that was the best thing in lockdown for me. HOwildartichokesLockdown has left me with an urge to spend as much time out of the house as possible, so I’ve been taking every opportunity to cook outdoors. I load up a tray, lay my chopping board and bowls on a garden table, and slice my way through a mountain of vegetables to barbecue. I’ve also been making flatbread and naan dough outside and by taking everything out on a neatly organised prep tray I can whisk up a dressing while I turn things on the barbecue. I’ve been trying to buy sustainable British charcoal and using dried garden twigs to smoke food. There’s that nice feeling of going slightly feral by cooking outside over an open fire. Even my dog has developed a taste for lightly barbecued cauliflower. HOThe Roasting Tin Around the World (Square Peg) is out now rukmini-iyerThe lettuce had been cut and the potatoes dug. The chard sat in bunches like floral bouquets. The radishes in wooden crates, their leaves tied together with white rubber bands.And then the restaurants closed. The markets too, and with them, the possibility that the vegetables may have been harvested in vain. Worse still, the cycle had begun months ago, long before lockdown. You can’t tell a field of peas to stop growing.A shuttered restaurant is just the visible face of a long chain that includes not only furloughed staff but suppliers, laundries, maintenance workers and drivers. The need to find a home for the food being grown for their tables was urgent. Box schemes were set up where you could order online and food arrived at your door. Beans and spinach found a home, flowers found a vase, farm workers could be paid.The box scheme I joined brought cucumbers and dill, parsley, heads of lettuce and bags of rocket, all delivered by the restaurant for which it had been grown. As I clicked on “vegetable box – buy” I scrolled down to find the restaurant’s kitchen had been busy too. There were ginger cakes and rye loaves, cookie dough and cordials. It was then I saw the ice-cream.The elderflower and lemon ice-cream arrived tucked among the chard, in a waxed cardboard tub. I prized off the lid to find not the creamy white ice I expected but one the colour of apricots. Here was an ice somewhere between ice-cream and sorbet, fruit and flower, as sharp as it was sweet. It had the soothing notes of vanilla and the fizz and froth of sherbet. I tucked in, slowly, a teaspoon at a time.The Fern Verrow vegetable box and Spring ice-cream are available from springrestaurant-shopRavneet GillPastry chef and authorAll my friends know I am not a salad girl. When I’m working in restaurants, I just eat carbs, pasta and rice. But lockdown has changed me. I’ve been baking every day it’s sugary and you’re tasting all the time, so I haven’t wanted big heavy meals. I was craving fresh Asian food, so I started making a prawn and peanut salad.I’ve been thinking about this salad, a lot. It’s taken weeks and weeks, and I’ve finally nailed it. Black vinegar is key, and you need good fish sauce, loads of lime juice, a bit of sugar and lovely vegetables. I always use the pre-roasted, salted peanuts because I’m lazy, and for prawns, I go to my fishmonger or Waitrose. The dressing is acidic it has that balance of sharpness and a bit of sweetness. It’s super fresh, crunchy, and I just feel healthy when I eat it. Now I’m a salad person. MTHRavneet Gill’s The Pastry Chef’s Guide (Pavilion) is out nowThis summer I became a hunter-gatherer, my senses highly tuned in the search for food. This didn’t just involve foraging, it also meant going down on hands and knees on the floor of my local Co-op, peering under shelves. I became more of an opportunist. Six weeks into lockdown, a friend of a friend spread an unbelievable rumour on WhatsApp: at 7pm a van with a wood-fired pizza oven would be parked at the bottom of a lane nearby. “Don’t mention this to anyone,” it ended. Was this illegal pizza? If I went out for margherita would I return as a super-spreader? That night the sky was dark but as I rounded a corner into the lane, I saw something magical: a fairy-lit van framed by a rainbow. As I waited, I talked to a furloughed worker from a bookshop and we helped each other with the impossible task what to choose when you don’t know when you’ll get to do this again? I opted for the prosciutto. By the time I got home, it was 8 o’clock, so the pizza waited as I clapped with my neighbours. Was it the best pizza I’ve ever tasted? No. But it was the one I needed most.Last Harvest by Dan Saladino : A Search for the World’s Most Endangered Foods is published by Jonathan Cape in 2021One of my desert island dishes is the spicy cumin lamb hand-pulled noodles from Xi’an Famous Foods in New York. So when Ixta Belfrage, a development chef at Ottolenghi, posted her recipe on Instagram, I decided to recreate it.These noodles are known as “biang biang” in Chinese. It’s phonetic, the words “biang biang” sound like the noodles when they are slapping on the kitchen counter. I used cull yaw, the meat of an older ewe, from Matt Chatfield, who usually supplies leading restaurants. The meat loses the lamby smell and ends up being more beefy. The noodles have this beautiful bouncy, chewy texture and the sauce a deep flavour from the cull yaw with the spice from cumin, and heat from Sichuan peppercorns.The joy of lockdown was having the time to recreate these dishes. Now I have the knowledge that I can make them too. MTHsambalshiokIt was the octopus tostada. Maybe the empanada or the deep leafy green mole what won it. Late-June Copenhagen felt almost post-covid. Numbers near zero, everything already opened for a month. We were nervous but needing to eat.We had wanted somewhere small. Simple in the best sense. Nothing fancy that would take too long. So Sanchez near the main station in the old red light district, at Istedgade 60. A cantina, not a New Nordic restaurant. We sat at the side bar by an open door, separated from the kitchen by sheets of Perspex. The meal was a sort of Mexican omakase. No choice. A small series of small plates of exquisitely crafted food.Rosio Sanchez was once a development chef at Noma. She knows which combinations work. Brilliant iterations of Mexican classics served with a smile. There were a couple of beers, there may have been a mescal. We watched the cooks work. Perfect plate after perfect plate. Our taste buds danced. All our food senses wide awake. We relaxed and we remembered why we eat in restaurants.It has been a joyfully erratic summer as far as eating goes a dance of last-minute barbecues, restaurant DIY kits, and one blustery family picnic that united deli-bought quiche and hot fistfuls of chicken-shop chips. Fittingly, then, there was something wholly unplanned about my most vivid food memory.Feeling a building hunger after a mid-July work meeting, I rode my bike towards Borough Market, weighing lunch options and dismissing all of them. Then I spotted Rice Error: the Bao restaurant group’s lockdown-prompted Taiwanese takeaway and delivery spin-off, operating out of a tucked-away hatch.Minutes later and I was perched in an abandoned courtyard, unwrapping a bamboo box to reveal a rumpled duvet of fluffy omelette, splotched with sriracha and nestled on a lively, umami-forward tumble of Chi Shang rice and mapo-spiced aubergine and tofu.There was a bag of sweet potato fries double-crisped by a salt-flecked batter and served with a neon purple, unaccountably delicious, pickled plum ketchup.The sky was as grey as the pavement, my only companions a couple of morose, crumb-seeking pigeons. Every bite felt like a holiday.Itamar SrulovichChef and co-owner, Honey \u0026amp Co, Honey \u0026amp Smoke, Honey \u0026amp SpiceWe were getting ready to reopen Honey \u0026amp Smoke after more than 100 days of lockdown – we hung sanitisers and put tape on the floor, briefed and trained the team, we burned sage for a ritual cleanse.The restaurant’s head chef plated the new dish for the team to taste – courgette kibbe with cashew tahini and a summery salad in pale green, dotted with cheeks of apricot. It looked so appealing: normally it would be devoured in seconds by everyone in the area, now we all stood around it, far from each other, not sure what to do, realising that we cannot all taste from the same plate. This was one of many little heartbreaks when we realised what the new normal entailed, like not being able to hug someone you haven’t seen since March, or sit together at staff lunch – small things we must do to stop the pandemic.It is a longstanding tradition in our company that whenever someone opens a watermelon they set a plate for staff and guests.As we all stood around that kibbe, one of the chefs came from downstairs with a platter of beautifully sliced watermelon and we each took a slice and sunk our teeth in – cold, sweet, refreshing, a distillation of so many summer memories, as good as it always was.An old tradition a new way for all of us to share food. What a weird summer this is.honeyandcoJoseph Benjamin restaurant in Chester started doing food to reheat at home. The two best things I ate this summer were by them. The first was a paella, which comes in a proper paella pan, for which they charge a little deposit. It has chicken, runner beans, butter beans, and saffron – obviously.The other thing is their beef – they do a brisket you can pick up. They’re known in Chester for their Sunday roast, and they started doing it for people at home while they’ve been closed, and it’s just as great. When lockdown started they were doing other things, like cooking for homeless people in Chester. They’re good guys. HOelitebistrosOne Sunday, I woke up with an urge to cook something I’d been craving for days, a much-celebrated Sindhi recipe – dal pakwan. I am lucky to have got this recipe from my mum’s neighbour, who would always send us a tiffin box full of it whenever she made it for her family.Making dal pakwan took me right back to my parents’ dining table. The dal (lentil) used in this dish is chana dal. It’s cooked with the most basic of spices and finished with fragrant ghee tadka (tempering). This is then served with pakwan, which are deep-fried flatbreads but more like crispy pastry.The crispiness of the pakwan with the spices and creaminess of the dal is enhanced with fresh herbs and chutneys – zingy coriander, and sour and sweet tamarind. The dish is finished with crunchy onions and juicy tomatoes. All this together on a plate is heaven.chetnamakanClaire PtakChef, author and owner, Violet BakeryYou can smell the smoke from Yum Yum Caribbean in Hackney Downs from my front door. One day, I walked outside, and … “They’re back! Yum Yum is open!”I always get the fried chicken, rice and peas, and coleslaw. The chicken is so tender and crispy, seasoned really well and I’m sure there are a few secret ingredients in there too. It reminds me of being home in the US and having amazing fried chicken.I was worried about Yum Yum because it is an independent business, and knowing what was going on for me, well …When I smelled that smoke, and went by the shop, it made me feel optimistic that businesses are going to reopen and be OK. I’m still really worried, and we don’t know what will happen, but it made me feel proud of people for persevering because it’s hard, it’s really hard. MTHAnissa HelouChef and authorI started making bouza, Arabic ice-cream, some 25 years ago when I wrote Lebanese Cuisine. Since then, I have had off and on phases. However, with the lockdown in Sicily, where I am based, I renewed my passion. I had all the ingredients in my pantry: best quality salep, a thickening agent of ground and dried wild orchid tubers from Safranbolu in Turkey, mastic from Chios, and rose and orange blossom water from Lebanon. I was able to buy unpasteurised milk from a woman in a nearby village who had 200 cows grazing in the mountains. I also had Kashmiri saffron. I spent days whisking salep into simmering milk to give it the incredible chewy and stretchy texture that is so typical of bouza to make the base for either the pure milk version flavoured with rose water and mastic, or the Iranian bastani flavoured with ground saffron infused in rose water. I had ice-cream in the morning, in the afternoon and before going to bed. Truly the best thing I had this summer!I sat on the terrace of the Seaside Boarding House – set on a cliff at a point where Chesil Beach becomes the Jurassic Coast – tucking into a tureen of fish soup rich with crab and any fish landed fresh that day. Made fragrant with tomatoes, saffron and herbs, it was accompanied by a feisty rouille so good you could drink the whole bowl while munching on thin slices of bread cooked crisp with olive oil. Alastair Little, an old pal of Mary Lou, who runs the Boarding House, gave the recipe to her after their years in Soho when Mary Lou ran the Groucho, and Alastair ran his eponymous restaurant on Frith Street.

I’d taken my time over making a tart, rubbing thyme leaves into the pastry, lining the old tin carefully, meticulously patching the faintest tear to prevent the filling leaking. I brought my work to the table, still warm, its custard barely set, the gentle pinks and greens of salmon and dill interrupted only by clouds of cream cheese. There was a cucumber salad on the side, too, with a grain mustard and wine vinegar dressing to lend a little edge to the calm summer notes.Few round the table knew the amount of work that went into that tart, albeit done at a leisurely pace, radio on, the kitchen door wide open to the garden. At the other end of the scale, equally seasonal pastries appeared the next day, made in minutes this time from a sheet of frozen puff pastry and a bag of ripe nectarines. On this occasion, a layer of cream cheese was stirred through with ground almonds and vanilla extract, and hidden under the fruit.There is often some sort of light, fresh cheese in the fridge at this time of year. The labneh I make by straining yogurt, salt and lemon though muslin overnight the full-fat thick stuff in tubs from the deli for spreading on toast and scattering with broad beans and olive oil and a sharper-tasting white goat’s curd as fluffy as a mousse. Such slightly bland, airy, paper-wrapped cheese takes summer flavours well, especially cucumber and radishes, salmon, raspberries and herbs, like mint and basil.I also keep it for midnight, too that final bite before I turn in for the night. Current favourite nocturnal fridge raids involve toast, a thick wave of silky white cheese, a scattering of raspberries, or a sliced apricot, then a pool of olive oil as deep and green as a rock pool.It is essential not to leave tears or holes in the pastry case. I give the pastry a brief kneading before I roll it out, using a light dusting of flour on the work surface, then wrap it loosely round the rolling pin and lower it into the tart tin. Patch any tears as you go, but they must be well sealed before baking the empty case.

Wrap in greaseproof paper and chill for 30 minutes.Put the salmon in a roasting dish, trickle with oil and season with salt, pepper and half the dill. (I often wrap the salmon in foil to make cleaning the dish easier.) Bake for 15-20 minutes until lightly cooked. Remove and leave to cool.Roll the pastry and use it to line a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Make sure there are no tears or cracks. Fill the pastry case with greaseproof paper and baking beans and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the baking beans and foil and return the pastry to the oven for 5 minutes until dry to the touch. Remove the tart case and lower the heat to 180Cgas mark 4.Beat together the eggs and cream until lightly mixed, then season with salt and pepper. Finely slice and add the spring onions. Break the salmon into large flakes and place in the pastry case. Add the remaining dill, then the cream cheese in tablespoon-sized pieces. Pour in the egg and cream mixture, then slide back into the oven on top of the heated tray and bake for 25 minutes.The tart is ready when lightly set. It should be wobbly when you gently shake the tray. Remove from the oven and leave to cool before cutting.I make rectangular tarts, so as not to waste pastry. You could cut round tarts and make cheese straws with the trimmings, brushing strips of leftover pastry with beaten egg and tossing them in grated parmesan before baking.

Joe Montemurro likes to push his full-backs very high. Lisa Evans and Katie McCabe playedthere last season and made their names as outright wingers.In midfield, Lia Wälti anchors with Jordan Nobbs and Kim Little ahead of her as attacking No 8s. When they come under pressure, Little drops back and forms a double pivot with Wälti as she can keep the ball in tight spaces. Nobbs is an all-action box-to-box midfielder who offers goal threat.In attack, Vivianne Miedema is the most recognisable player in the Arsenal team and one of the biggest goal threats in world football. However, her goals are only part of her game. She likes to move away from the front-line and drift into the No 10 position, allowing the likes of Nobbs, Little and Van de Donk to get into the area as support forwards.Arsenal are a team who seek to dominate through possession they are patient with the ball, with players rotating positions. “The important thing is that the players understand space and rotations, so that when we pass the ball there is always an option for the player receiving straight away and we have second phase and third phase of play mapped out,” Montemurro says.The Australian left-back Steph Catley has been added from Melbourne City. She has played under Montemurro before and is considered one of the best left-backs in the world. The goalkeeper Lydia Williams also arrives from Melbourne City, while the Swiss full-back Noëlle Maritz arrives after a trophy laden seven-year spell at Wolfsburg. She can play in either full-back position or on either wing. The 20-year old Swiss international Malin Gut was also signed to provide cover for international teammate Lia Wälti in the defensive midfield role.Montemurro joined Arsenal in December 2017 after holding several coaching roles with the Melbourne City men’s and women’s teams. He is a proponent of total football based on short passing and rotation of positions in attack. “The less the opponent has the ball, the less they can hurt you,” he says. He also likes to make specifications for each opponent and enjoys solving tactical problems in-game. His assistant, Aaron D’Antino, is an expert in video analysis.They are far from a one-woman team but Vivianne Miedema is undoubtedly the star. She broke the Netherlands goal-scoring record at the age of 22 and has won the WSL Golden Boot in the last two seasons. She is also a talented creative player, providing more assists than any other player in the the league last season. She seems to glide across the pitch and enjoys working outside the penalty area as much as she enjoys working inside it.The Australia forward Caitlin Foord signed in February but was only able to play twice prior to lockdown. A seasoned performer, she is now looking to make her mark in Europe, “She’s a little bit different to some of the players we’ve got, she’s very powerful in the final third,” Montemurro says.Arsenal need to win the tournament to qualify for next season’s competition. They are by no means favourites given the presence of Lyon and Wolfsburg but they will absolutely aim to win the tournament in Spain. Saturday’s quarter-final with PSG could go either way.Arsenal remain the only British team to have won the tournament back in 2006-07. This is the first time they have been in the Champions League since 2014 and while they do not have the pedigree of Lyon or Wolfsburg, they have played in more Champions League quarter-finals than any team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6c87fc6fc77e39d7e99c2b3028fdbeb083e568/195_58_3074_1844/master/3074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2951b66e10e145594d3b85df1302041f","title":"coronavirus lockdown surge puppy ownership uk","story":"Kennel Club finds many new puppy owners missed ‘red flags’ because of lack of researchEvery festive season, households across the UK are reminded that “a dog is life, not just for Christmas”. But as dog lovers rushed to buy new puppies during the coronavirus lockdown, many seemed to ignore this advice, and bought dogs having done little research – or even without meeting the animal beforehand.According to research by the Kennel Club, the coronavirus crisis has led to a surge in puppy ownership across the UK.However, a quarter of new owners admitted they bought their dog after doing little research, with one in four pandemic puppy owners saying they might inadvertently have bought their pet from a puppy farm.Meanwhile, Cats Protection said it had also noticed a rise in demand for cats since May. The charity has rehomed about 2,400 cats since it began its new “hands-free homing” process during lockdown. In response to the findings, the Kennel Club has launched a #BePuppyWise campaign urging people to take time and do proper research before purchasing their dog.Bill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, said: “Our dogs are certainly helping us through the pandemic, providing a welcome and happy distraction as Covid-19 causes anxiety, suffering and disruption across the nation.“However, we do have concerns about those puppies which may have been bought on impulse, without owners doing their homework on how or where to get a dog responsibly, or fully realising a puppy is a new family member for life, not a short-term commodity.”Battersea Dogs and Cats Home has also warned about the risks of buying a puppy without doing proper research. Its chief executive, Claire Horton, said: “Battersea sadly knows all too well the pain caused by the cruel puppy trade – both the suffering endured by the animals involved and the heartbreak their new owners feel – as we and rescue centres across the country are forced to pick up the pieces.“We know nobody buys a pet with the intention of hurting an animal, but purchasing puppies and kittens online often does just that. The pet they receive at the end of this buying chain may be incredibly unwell, underage for sale and under-socialised due to the conditions in which they were bred, leaving owners confused, distressed, disappointed and usually significantly out of pocket.”Jacqui Cuff, Cats Protection’s head of advocacy and government relations, urged cat buyers to be aware that a surge in demand creates the ideal conditions for unscrupulous sellers who put profit before welfare.“These profit-driven sellers may be selling kittens which are sick or too young to be separated from their mothers, which can lead to high vet bills. Sadly, some kittens bred in poor conditions may not survive, which can be incredibly distressing for their new owner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4ea0b77bbe41224a57fd5803af8eb483b70b78/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0d05c65dc0e7cd5897b1c419ca2e7a","title":"ruby wax i felt i had no community so i started one","story":"Frazzled Cafe aims to help those who feel overwhelmed.

Social media’s images of perfect people having the time of their lives don’t help, making us feel that heart-plunging dip in self-esteem.Isolation is one of the biggest causes of mental ill-health, even affecting length of life. In prisons, a UN special rapporteur has said that prolonged solitary confinement is a form of torture. Humans are at their best working as a team, and empathy is the glue that sticks them together. This is a far cry from the dog-eat-dog culture we live in (though I’ve never seen a dog eat a dog).For my forthcoming book, I spent two years looking for green shoots poking through. In every area – tech, education, business, eco urban neighbourhoods and towns – the innovators all share the belief that our future success depends on working as a team. People come with their inidual skills, but everyone feels that they matter. Empathy flows when people care that we exist the feeling that someone always has your back is a joyous way to live.I always dreamed of a group of people to call my own where I could drop my mask and not have to say “Fine” with a rictus smile in response to the question, “How are you?” Because I felt I had no community, I started one, called Frazzled Cafe. About 12 to 15 people would meet every two weeks in cafes across the UK, supported by a trained facilitator to give the session structure and make it safe. Some of these groups lasted as long as four years. About one in four people have a mental illness, but Frazzled Cafe aims to help those who simply feel overwhelmed.Since Covid-19, Frazzled has moved to Zoom, and we’ve been flooded with people who want to share their thoughts. They have expressed feelings of uncertainty, loneliness being overwhelmed by balancing work, relationships and family life and guilt for appreciating aspects of their isolation – issues that had perhaps been exacerbated by the lockdown. No one had the manual on how to deal with this situation, so they would come and talk about it.I now hold nightly meetings for 50-100 people. We also have trained hosts who hold smaller meetings for up to 15 attendees throughout the day – you can sign up for either at FrazzledCafe.org, and it’s free. Attendees have said things such as, “By coming here, it calms the chaos in my mind... you get that instant, raw connection that brings out the true essence of what it means to be human.” I’ve said throughout my life: “Talking is half the cure.”• Ruby Wax is an actor, mental health campaigner and the author of And Now For The Good News… To The Future With Love (Penguin Life, published 17 September)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3d24d04997aeaa0f16fab934903853b5e23466/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57fa08918b869e32ab8a8ba94933095c","title":"tim spector food education should be compulsory","story":"Boris Johnson’s plan to ban buy-one-get-one-free deals and junk food ads is like using a sticking plaster on a severed limb• Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the worldObesity is back on the news agenda. The coronavirus pandemic has shone the spotlight firmly on our health and diet. While this is good news, we are deluding ourselves if we believe Boris Johnson’s plan to ban buy-one-get-one-free deals and junk food adverts before the watershed, and to legislate for calorie counts in restaurants, is going to work better than a sticking plaster on a severed limb.Junk food is bad for us – especially when labelled misleadingly as “low fat, low carb, low sugar”. Diets containing high levels of ultra-processed foods have now been shown in clinical trials to increase hunger and the amount people eat. They also lead to a lack of ersity of gut microbes and poor gut health, which causes yet more metabolic problems.Johnson’s reluctance to do the obvious and extend the successful sugar tax to other sweet products and ultra-processed foods is likely due to the lobbying of the rich and powerful food and drink companies, which aren’t going to disappear any time soon. Without government action, the disparity between junk and real food pricing will continue to grow. The Henry Dimbleby national food strategy report has proposed extending free school meals, which will help the most deprived, but more is needed and education is the key.Doctors like me learned virtually nothing about nutrition at medical school, and the same is sadly true today. With the UK lacking a traditional food culture, most of us are very ignorant. Food education should be a compulsory subject, from nursery school to university, like maths and English.Parents should be encouraged to introduce a much wider range of healthy foods to their infants and toddlers. Primary school kids should start learning about plants and how to grow and cook them, and these lessons should increase in secondary school so they learn more about agriculture, food production and the relationship between our environment, nutrition and health. Before leaving school, everyone should be able to prepare a healthy meal from scratch with a few simple ingredients, just as we learn our multiplication tables or how to write a letter.All health professionals should undergo more rigorous training in nutrition as a core subject, and receive annual updates once qualified, so that they can spread the word based on knowledge not bluff.

It’s been a sanctuary to return to from countless trips around the region, a place where the rigours, and sometimes dangers, of Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere could be set aside for a while.In Lebanon, I could get things done. For all its faults, it’s a can-do place, where resourcefulness has got its people through. And it’s needed to be. Almost nothing works as it’s supposed to here: just getting by requires the spirit of an entrepreneur and a handyman.Few of the things we would take for granted elsewhere – electricity, clean water, waste disposal, the internet – are a given here. I’ve become proficient at each, just as I have in overlooking the country’s profound flaws. The dysfunction that underwrites Lebanon is part of the pact of living here. But no one could have guessed that it would end up destroying Beirut – literally.The explosion that thundered through the city on 4 August was clearly not normal. Since the end of the civil war, there had only been a few explosions here – car bombs that assassinated people. But this cataclysmic event was of a different magnitude. Whole streets of buildings were wrecked the closer to the port, the greater the chaos. I’d experienced explosions in Baghdad, Aleppo, Gaza, Mosul and southern Lebanon, but always during war and never on this scale. What on earth had just happened?As the dust cleared that fateful night, as the cascading of glass from high-rise towers slowed, the panicked aftermath of the blast turned to cold anger this had probably been very preventable. It wasn’t a hostile act, but a disaster borne of staggering incompetence and indifference to the welfare of the city’s residents.Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, one of the more lethal explosive compounds, had been stored in a shed at the entrance to town for six years. Within days of the blast, we learned that fireworks had been kept in the same shed, and a welder may have started a fire that ignited it all.The chain of events was unfathomable, as was the sheer scale of the damage. All the places where my formative memories of Beirut took shape were destroyed. Many of the people who helped shape them were wounded, some of them badly. I’ve made a career in the Middle East trying to keep a dispassionate distance from the events I’ve covered and people I’ve met. But that nominal barrier didn’t apply this time. This was personal.Everything that had blighted Lebanon – the corruption and incompetence of its leaders, the indifference of officials, nepotism, non-state actors, the widespread abuse of power – had come together in an apocalyptic storm that had shocked the world. How on earth could it have been allowed to happen?More than a week later, a broken city is still wrestling with the aftermath, as it is with the truly existential question of whether a functioning country can emerge from the ruins. Paying for the damage is beyond the capability of a bankrupt state already brought to its knees by three decades of industrial-scale corruption.International aid will help with the first stages of recovery. Life will go on for the Lebanese who decide to stay, or can’t leave. But what sort of an existence will it be here? If this isn’t the impetus to put the state on a more credible and sovereign footing, could anything succeed in turning things around?My house is repaired (I was 1.2 miles from the centre of the explosion), as are those of friends and colleagues who were closer to the port. If there is a “normal” left in Lebanon, I’m somewhere near it. But life here is unsettling now, more so than at any point in Lebanese history this is the moment of reckoning.I moved to Istanbul from Beirut 18 months ago, and I’ve been back a few times since. Every trip it’s been obvious how quickly Lebanon is sinking into intense poverty because of the financial crisis. It’s been sad to watch it unfold from afar. I was actually supposed to be travelling to Beirut for the first time since Covid-19 lockdowns lifted the week of the explosion anyway, and had already braced myself to see a much changed country. I didn’t expect to be frantically making phone calls and sending messages to check on the whereabouts of friends in the aftermath of one of the most powerful explosions ever recorded.When you’re flying into Beirut, one of the easiest landmarks to spot from the plane is the port, with its giant grain silos towering over the eastern, Christian side of the city. I used to use it as a marker to figure out where my old apartment was from the air. The night after the explosion, the whole docks area was ablaze with rescue teams’ floodlights, and the hipster-ish neighbourhood of Mar Mikhaël behind it – my old home – lay in total darkness. It was surreal.It truly is difficult to comprehend the scale of this disaster. A friend showed me the remains of his flat and I couldn’t understand how he was still alive. The first apartment I lived in in Beirut, 900 metres from the port, was blown to smithereens. Luckily, my elderly neighbours were not home at the time.The speed with which teams of volunteers from all over the country mobilised to help those whose homes were affected is a true testament to the kindness and generosity of ordinary Lebanese people. Their dedication to helping out neighbours and strangers alike stands in stark contrast to the non-existent clean-up effort from the state. More than once I saw groups of police and soldiers standing by, looking on as citizens did all the work.One thing that will probably stick with me – and all Beirutis – forever is the sound of broken glass, absolutely everywhere, all the time: falling from tower blocks and skyscrapers being swept or bulldozed out of half a city crunching under your shoes like fresh snow.It’s one thing to report in war zones and dangerous places when you’ve made careful calculations about risk and you know what to expect when you arrive. Scenes of devastation akin to Syria or Iraq in a place you considered as home, and as safe, is heartbreaking in a different way. The people of Lebanon deserve so much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebabed6cfcc4961c57e89782b68ef577a5d5c522/0_33_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bd827cc8c5e361ba8f2a6e873e9bed","title":"housing market has busiest month in more than 10 years","story":"The pandemic has ‘rewritten the rulebook’ as pent-up demand boosts the market, says RightmoveThe housing market has had its busiest month in more than 10 years, with the traditional summer lull replaced by a flurry of activity from buyers and sellers, according to the property website Rightmove.Would-be sellers were also active, with more properties coming on to the market than in any month since 2008.The housing market was closed in lockdown and reopened in mid-May, sparking a flurry of activity. July brought a stamp duty holiday on homes costing up to £500,000 in England and £250,000 in Wales and Scotland, which further fuelled activity.Last week figures from the UK’s largest estate agency firm, Countrywide, showed that demand for homes costing between £500,000 and £750,000 had soared since the tax break was announced, and Rightmove’s figures suggest a similar effect for other agents.Miles Shipside, a Rightmove director, said: “There have been many changes as a result of the unprecedented pandemic, and these include a rewriting of the previously predictable seasonal rulebook for housing market activity and prices.”He added: “Rather than just a release of existing pent-up demand due to the suspension of the housing market during lockdown, there’s an added layer of additional demand due to people’s changed housing priorities after the experience of lockdown.”The demand for homes has put pressure on lenders and conveyancing which, under social distancing rules, are often operating below their usual capacity.Shipside said: “Patience will be required, especially with some lenders limiting their product ranges due to capacity constraints in their ability to process mortgages.”At the end of last month Nationwide building society warned of a “false dawn” in the housing market after reporting a price jump in July.It said that as the furlough scheme unwinds there could be more job losses, which would dampen activity again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36d7913fcd873c8826dd7edf4ae5ce8177b7d29/0_47_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfce486aa2225e279418fc8cb26cf4f","title":"labour insists tory mp accused of should not return to commons","story":"Labour had called for the former minister to be suspended after his bail date was extendedThe Conservative former minister arrested on suspicion of rape has agreed not to return to work at Westminster next month after his bail was extended to November, his party announced on Sunday.With the House of Commons summer recess due to end on 1 September, opposition parties had called for the MP to be suspended from parliament.Instead it is understood he has voluntarily agreed not to attend the House of Common, but will continue to represent his constituents from home. He will not have the party whip suspended while the police investigation continues.In a statement released on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Conservative whips’ office said: “These are serious allegations and it is right that they are investigated fully. A decision on the whip will be reviewed once the police investigation has been concluded.”The accused MP, who has not been named, was taken into custody in east London on 1 August and subsequently released while investigations are carried out. The complainant, a former parliamentary aide, reported four incidents alleged to have taken place between July 2019 and January 2020 in Westminster, Lambeth and Hackney. She alleges that the MP assaulted her, forced her to have sex, and left her so traumatised that she had to go to hospital.The Sunday Times reported that the allegations were first reported to the Conservative chief whip, Mark Spencer. It is understood Spencer does not believe a sexual assault was reported to him in his conversation with the complainant, but acknowledges that she reported “abusive behaviour and threats”. He advised her to go to the independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). The alleged victim made her claims to the ICGS this year.Campaigners including the TUC and the Fawcett Society have called for parliamentary authorities to take action. “The House of Commons should be no different from any other workplace. Safety and the safeguarding of staff must be paramount. Failure to suspend is yet another example of minimising violence against women and girls and failure to believe victims and survivors when they bravely speak out,” they said.Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said: “Safeguarding can’t be done by half measures. To suggest that there is no safeguarding risk through online contact with constituents shows a worrying lack of understanding of how abuse manifests.“This halfway house of allowing him to work from home is a product of the Conservatives failing to take fair, clear and decisive action over this very serious issue, and we should expect better from a party of government.”A statement from the politan police said: “A man in his 50s was arrested on Saturday 1 August 2020. His bail to return date has been extended to early November 2020. The investigation is being undertaken by the Met central specialist crime complex case team.”News of the former minister’s arrest emerged days after Charlie Elphicke, a former Conservative party whip and married father of two, became the first MP in a generation to be convicted of sexual assault.He was found guilty of three charges of sexual assault dating back to 2007 and 2016, including one incident in which he forced himself on a woman at his Belgravia home, groped her and shouted: “I’m a naughty Tory.”The former prime minister Theresa May’s government faced criticism after removing the whip from Elphicke when allegations first emerged, only to return it before a crucial confidence vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c15f54ed2f755e6c9f7f2b73c625054f0a4a007/0_111_5772_3463/master/5772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0efaa823aa1b4d9fd241dac41883e9","title":"john mcdonnell calls for extension of a year to coronavirus ban on evictions","story":"Moratorium in England and Wales during coronavirus crisis is due to end next weekJohn McDonnell has stepped up pressure on the government to extend a ban on evictions in England and Wales beyond next week, amid fears of a surge in homelessness among private renters.Demanding that the government take urgent action, the former shadow chancellor said a ban on landlords evicting tenants was required for at least another year while the threat of a second wave of coronavirus infections loomed.Last week the Scottish government outlined plans to extend a ban on evictions by six months.McDonnell said: “Many people are becoming desperately worried that they will now face evictions. Many cannot rely upon the goodwill of their landlords to prevent them losing their homes. That’s why it is premature to end the ban on evictions, especially with so many jobs being lost and incomes drying up.”From 24 August, private landlords in England and Wales will be able to go to court to initiate eviction procedures against tenants, prompting fears among housing groups that there could be a rush of cases and a rise in homelessness. The shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, has previously called for the moratorium on evictions to be extended.McDonnell said sweeping reforms were required to curb the power of landlords and tackle Britain’s housing crisis.His proposals for the post-Covid economy include an increase in capital gains tax for second homes, a legal limit on the number of properties that inidual landlords can own, a ban on the purchasing of homes through companies, and cancelling rent arrears caused by Covid-19.Ministers introduced the ban on evictions at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, initially for three months, and extended it until August as the scale of the pandemic became apparent.The government had promised last year to ban section 21 “no fault” eviction notices, which allow landlords to evict renters without a reason following the end of their fixed-term tenancy period.However, it has so far failed to act on the pledge, meaning tenants could be evicted without landlords needing to give a reason from next week.A spokeswoman for the housing ministry said it had changed court rules to require landlords to provide more information about their tenants’ situation when seeking an eviction. Laws passed in March force landlords to give tenants at least three months’ notice.The spokeswoman added: “We will provide appropriate support to those who have been particularly affected by coronavirus when court proceedings start again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d92d2fc42e2770579cbf4f3eaecca777ac8973/0_67_4150_2489/master/4150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9c1d3295468d6301c6e97fd108fb178","title":"england innings pakistan potential grenade second test ageas bowl","story":"Whoever was batting against Pakistan on day four, every delivery looked as if it might be his lastThere was a sadistic pleasure to be had for an old pro from the brief moments of play at the Rose Bowl on Sunday. At the start of the England innings every other delivery seemed unplayable. The floodlights reflected brightly on the shiny, wine-dark Dukes ball and the pitch retained sufficient moisture to provide the most treacherous stage for opening batsmen.The ball swung in the air for Shaheen Afridi, then it kissed the turf and decided to change direction Mohammad Abbas, wobbling the seam down the track in the modern way, appeared to be bowling fast leg-breaks.From the sofa this was mesmerising entertainment. Every delivery was a potential grenade and during the five overs of the English innings the Pakistan bowlers allowed no respite. Looking on felt like a guilty, voyeuristic delight.This was no time to be an opening batsman in fact throughout this summer opening the innings has been a precarious pursuit for Englishmen. Already there have been four ducks: two for Dom Sibley, one for Rory Burns, one, perversely, for Jos Buttler.There was not much that Burns could do with the delivery he received from Afridi on Sunday he needed the good fortune to miss it but the ball was pitched too full. It was quite a good duck. Whoever was batting, every delivery looked as if it might be his last.As the ball was behaving so malevolently the cameras switched quickly to the England balcony, first to Zak Crawley when he was the next man in, then to Joe Root after Burns’ dismissal.Both are phlegmatic iniduals but it is fair to say that a certain amount of concern was etched on their faces.From their vantage point they could see the ball thudding into Sibley’s hip or darting past the bat and over the top of the stumps into the expectant hands of Mohammad Rizwan. If they were curious they could glimpse at the replays on the TV screen in the dressing room for more ghoulish details. Suddenly Pakistan’s 236 looked like a very good score.Crawley did not have to watch for long nor did Root since the rain returned so they were spared too much torment. As the next man in, a constant, careful perusal of the bat being beaten can be counterproductive. My memory was jogged: a Somerset dressing room of about four decades ago, a dank, dreary day and the ball jagging all over the place with our openers hitting fresh air. No 3 was the great Viv Richards. He watched half a dozen deliveries to assess conditions then he retreated to the back of the dressing room and watched no more.He did not want to clutter his mind with any more images of a deviously moving ball beating the bat. So when he went out to bat he played what he saw rather than what he remembered and then, magically, the ball often seemed to be on its best behaviour when he was on strike.Cricket can be the most captivating spectacle when the ball is misbehaving, with every delivery suggesting melodrama, but there is a balance to be struck.The five overs received by England’s batsmen – as well as those delivered to the Pakistan tail – were perilous. Too often that is also the case in early April on a green, moist surface when the balance is too much in favour of the bowlers.In such circumstances a legitimate response for batsmen can be to swing and hope classic Test-match survival techniques may be dismissed as impractical – because it feels as if an impossible delivery is just around the corner. And so the game is diminished. It would have been fascinating to see how England’s batsmen responded to the testing conditions. But the weather won once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92da52833684fcef0213dd03823599a3006a2af4/0_119_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d18c9305be4d318f489908df3459e5c7","title":"one of my best drives lewis hamilton celebrates spanish grand prix win","story":"Lewis Hamilton has described his win at the Spanish Grand Prix as one of his best drives and close to perfection.

Climbing from his car afterwards he also pointed to the Black Lives Matter symbol on his helmet and insisted that he would keep the pressure on to ensure the issue of racism remained in the public eye.Hamilton finished 24 seconds in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen after a race in which the British driver had led every lap from pole. He had been unchallenged out front. It looked serene and Hamilton believed he had found another level.“We all try for perfection and it is not always easy to deliver,” he said. “When I came across the line I didn’t know it was the last lap, I was like a horse with blinkers. I was just going to keep going. For me it was right up there with some of the best drives I have done.”Hamilton has extended his lead in the world championship even further and now has four wins from six races this season but, while he has enjoyed more spectacular or hard-fought victories, he nonetheless felt this performance was outstanding.“I felt like I was in the clear zone,” he said. “The clarity I had whilst I was driving. It is hard to say what helps you get into that space. I felt fantastic in the car, it was physically challenging but in not making mistakes and delivering lap upon lap I was in the perfect zone. I never would have thought I would have a lead of 24 seconds. All these elements were in place and I was very centred in my core.”The drivers once more made their anti-racism gesture on the grid but Hamilton restated his determination to ensure the momentum for change would not be lost. “It is important to continue to push,” he said. “There are many, many companies here that have not held themselves accountable.

Hanagan is so well known as a Reds fan that when he became champion jockey in 2010, it was arranged for him to be given the trophy by Ian Rush at half-time during a game at Anfield.As Liverpool worked towards a trophy of their own in recent months, Hanagan was struggling to recover from a fall at Newcastle in February that left him with three fractured vertebrae, an injury so grievous he feared his career could be over at the age of 39. “It certainly helped,” he said of his team’s success during his recuperation.“I’ve been waiting a long bloody time for them to lift the trophy, but it was just great to see. I grew up as a Liverpool fan, my sons are Liverpool fans now, my Dad’s a Liverpool fan and his dad was. It’s just memories, isn’t it, of going to the match with your dad. It was just great to see, so chuffed. I was able to enjoy it and it was a great influence to get back in action.”Hanagan’s fall came in a sprint handicap, when Requinto Dawn clipped heels and fell. “You know when it’s a bad one. I couldn’t get up. That was scary. You can imagine the thoughts going through your mind. I thought, I’m never going to ride again. I just hope I can walk again...”The jockey reached the stage of discussing with his family the question of whether he should retire and some voices were raised in favour. “I asked the specialist, if I do fall off again, which is probably inevitable, how is my back going to be? And it’s going to be just as strong as before. So there’s no worries about that.”Racing Welfare and the sport’s chief medical officer, Jerry Hill, are among those Hanagan wants to thank but his greatest gratitude is for staff at Jack Berry House, the Injured Jockeys Fund facility in Malton, close to his home. He has been rehabbing there every day since it reopened in mid-June and says: “It sounds crazy but I actually feel like I’m fitter, stronger than I’ve ever been in my career. They’ve been absolutely unbelievable.

So she pours a cider, steps into her bath – and logs on to the fringe’s freakiest showsThe Edinburgh fringe is always a highlight of my year. Where else but in this melting pot of stress and cider will you see a comedian down a pint of red wine, strip naked, then tape a bread knife to their face – or experience a 12-hour, live-art show that starts with a nude woman covered in snails?With the fringe cancelled this year, I feel somewhat hollow, and not just because I’m usually out and about in the city reviewing it all. So, in glorious denial, I’m refusing to accept that it’s not happening, and instead will attempt to recreate the experience from home, away from the bustling crowds and dark venues full of sweaty strangers. I’m bingeing as many shows as I can, but it’s just me alone in my room. At least I’m starting off with the average-sized fringe audience.How is this possible? Well, this year a number of venues (ZOO, Gilded Balloon, theSpace) have launched rolling online programmes, with a mixture of old recordings, new films and live performances. No queues and a front row seat guaranteed. Still, I miss getting to the wrong venue, then having to race up three hills and arrive late, sweaty and full of adrenaline. Doing laps up and down the stairs doesn’t quite have the same effect. Sadly, the place I miss the most is one I can’t go to virtually. Unable to spend my evenings in Summerhall’s glowing courtyard, I make a donation to save the venue instead.After wading through a handful of shows I’d rather forget, I stumble on some gems. Coded Dreams, part of ZOO TV, is a beautiful short dance film that leaves you longing for intimate touch and open landscapes. Luke Evans and Jake Humphreys grapple with each other’s bodies as dreamlike editing flicks them between woods and water, physical space collapsing in on itself.Underground, an eco-fable told through shadow puppetry, is part of theSpace’s programme. A delicate depiction of the rewilding of Earth, it’s written and directed by Amy Wakeman and Patricia Lain, who would have been making their fringe debut this year. In the very funny Zeroko, by Masashi Kadoya and Keisuke Hamaguchi, a writer’s hands keep running away from his body. Part of EdFringe Japan’s offering, it’s a wonderfully silly duet. Another not to miss is Hope Dickson Leach’s shimmering film Ghost Light, part of the Edinburgh international festival. It’s a treasure of a piece that celebrates stories old, new, and as yet untold.Several companies have made audio pieces designed to be listened to at home. Less a play and more playful ASMR, Play in Your Bathtub is incredibly soothing, with plinky piano and a mixture of whispered and soft-spoken speech. Another audio piece, Darkfield Radio, is an episodic binaural show made by the team behind Seance and Flights. Voiced by Christopher Brett Bailey, it’s an intriguing, creepy start to a supernatural story.When I start to get lonely, I rally my pub quiz team. They join me on Zoom for Swamp Motel’s brilliant Plymouth Point, a virtual escape room that ramps up the tension so effectively that we’re all screeching by the end. Completely exhilarating, and a serious challenge. Reminded of how much watching with other people adds to the experience of a show, I ask my parents if they’ll stay up late drinking with me and seeing what strange cabaret we can find online. Instead, they watch old episodes of Line of Duty and go to bed before dark.With my brain dizzy from non-stop screens, I ask for help from some fringe veterans. Aside from shows, how do you recreate the experience of the festival? “I would rig up a watering can from the ceiling,” comedian Jack Rooke advises, “and then every time I came into my bedroom it would rain on me a little bit, so I’m just perpetually damp.” This is a recurring theme. “Be really, really wet and cold,” orders Rebecca Biscuit, who, with Louise Mothersole, makes up Sh!t Theatre. “Then turn your heating up really high and shut all of the windows and open the oven door.”Last year I danced on tables with Sh!t Theatre, singing loudly to Bruce Springsteen and stuffing pizza after an interview for their show. Now, we’re reduced to fuzzy video. Perhaps it’s apt when I ask how to recreate the feel of the fringe, disappointment and discomfort feature heavily. “Start drinking early and keep going. But if you go to the toilet during a show,” says Mothersole, “you’re not allowed to come back in and finish.” For the authentic fringe experience, they insist, a healthy dose of envy is vital too. “Print out all of your peers’ greatest achievements,” Biscuit instructs, “and poster them all around the wall. Anyone your age you’ve ever met, anyone you’ve ever been to school with, their marriages, their kids, their jobs: all over the walls.”Sh!t Theatre’s 2016 fringe-first winning Letters to Windsor House is streaming throughout August, and later this month, Rooke is performing at Shedinburgh, Francesca Moody’s curation of shows streamed live from sheds across the country. Shedinburgh’s profits will go towards helping new artists get to the fringe in 2021. At a place as emotionally and financially bankrupting as the fringe, funding pots like this are vital for supporting new work, says playwright and actor Yolanda Mercy, whose Underbelly Untapped-winning solo show, Quarter Life Crisis, is another Shedinburgh commission, and has just been programmed for the new season at London’s Bridge Theatre. “Without Underbelly Untapped, I wouldn’t have been able to go to the fringe,” she says frankly. “Obviously it couldn’t happen this year, but I really miss it. It was an honour to call that beautiful city my home for a month.”I’m missing it too. Mum can overcharge me for lukewarm coffee and a shrivelled bacon sandwich, and try to press the newspaper in my hand every morning like a flyer, but something’s still lacking.Back to shows and perhaps the most reliable platform for exciting work online this year is Fringe of Colour. A collection of films and performances organised by Jess Brough, the clips are released weekly, and for a tenner you get access to the whole month’s programme. The Toussaint Douglass Show is a perfectly pitched, terribly green-screened sketch comedy. With brilliantly blunt humour, Douglass illuminates the ridiculousness of lockdown. In the simple but sophisticated Fortune Online, Sean Wai Keung crumbles fortune cookies and reads out the little rolls of paper. Instead of prophecies, he reads a collection of facts, both personal and political, which reveal how the west’s attribution of fortune cookies as being generically Asian feeds into a hostile culture of racism. Also on Fringe of Colour is Somebody Jones’ play Black Women Dating White Men, directed by Khadifa Wong. Framed as verbatim Zoom chats, these nuanced conversations between five young black women about the obstacles they face with their white long-term partners are engaging, funny, blunt and thoughtful.Finally, a rare opportunity to leave the house comes with Ben Hart \u0026amp Friends at the New Normal festival, a mini festival of cancelled Edinburgh shows in south London. Hart is a deft, delicate storyteller, as well as a nimble magician, and he hosts an evening that reminds you how much magic is rooted in comedy. Taking place in the stunning courtyard at the Royal Victoria Patriotic Building, it’s weirdly moving to be in a real live audience for the first time since the start of lockdown, to see people’s thrill at being together again, and to hear the performers’ gratitude to everyone for being there.After almost five months of a much slower pace of life, it is a pleasure to have so many things to rush to, to be late to, to walk out of, to miss. In my cider-soaked efforts to recreate the fringe, I’ve found new artists, new shows, and new hopes for next year. But I can’t help it: the people are what really make the fringe. The strangers you meet in queues. The artists you chat to in bars. The friends you collapse with at the end of the day. However many shows you watch at home, nothing can quite recreate the feeling of being squeezed together on a balmy August evening in an Edinburgh courtyard, the light fading behind you, telling stories about stories, and revelling in the togetherness of it all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d1ebcf346ff5455ebc3313ca5258848a078487/18_0_3494_2098/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abb2f9b80f871b35dad1907f2eff4506","title":"truss leads china hawks trying to derail tiktoks london hq plan","story":"Any last-minute reversal could lead to further deterioration in UK-China relationsA last-ditch attempt to prevent the UK government from endorsing TikTok’s plans to locate its headquarters in London is being mounted by China hawks who accuse the app’s parent company of cooperating with authorities in Xinjiang province.Downing Street is keen to encourage TikTok to move from Beijing to London, but faces a rearguard action led by the trade secretary, Liz Truss, who is anxious about some of the demands being made by the business.TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, wants a public statement of support from a senior minister that it will be welcome in the long term so that it does not face what happened to Huawei, which last month was banned from supplying 5G technology to the UK from 2027.Downing Street’s initial enthusiasm has provoked concern from China hawks, who have responded by hunting for information to use to force the prime minister to retreat, including seeking details about ByteDance’s relationship with Beijing.A key figure supporting the TikTok move is the junior business and trade minister Gerry Grimstone, a Sinophile and former chairman of the insurer Standard Life. His influence in No 10 is understood to have irritated Truss, who believes she should have a greater role in inward investment.Any last-minute change of heart would amount to a significant deterioration in an already tense Chinese-British relationship. A source familiar with the situation said: “This is different to Huawei. Huawei was banned because of worries about spying and US sanctions. This would be a decision based on Xinjiang.”China is accused of presiding over a fierce repression of its Muslim minority in its western province of Xinjiang. There is limited available evidence that ByteDance has become embroiled.Critics of the company are relying on research from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute released late last year. The thinktank said other ByteDance-owned apps were used to promote Chinese government content, particularly in Xinjiang.Citing local media coverage, ASPI concluded that ByteDance “collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang, where it plays an active role in disseminating the party state’s propaganda on Xinjiang”.Founded in 2012, ByteDance owns TikTok and Douyin, China’s leading video app. TikTok is the international version of Douyin. While the two share some technology, their video content is separate.ByteDance said Douyin allowed law enforcement groups to set up accounts, as other social media firms do around the world. “Douyin does not endorse the content generated by its users, but rather, similar to Twitter or Facebook, provides a platform to all of its users,” it said.Leaked documents passed to the  last September showed that TikTok previously instructed its moderators to censor videos that mentioned Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong.The company said the guidelines were “retired” in May 2019, and videos referring to all three topics can be found today. But this week it emerged that a news app owned by ByteDance in Indonesia had censored similar terms until a few weeks ago.ByteDance is engaged in a set of complex negotiations, including the sale of its US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand operations to Microsoft to avoid being banned in US by Donald Trump.That has left London the favoured location for its worldwide headquarters, although the discussions nearly collapsed after Downing Street reversed a previous decision to allow Huawei to supply 5G equipment in July.The company’s growth has been meteoric, with TikTok surpassing 2bn downloads worldwide, leading to talk of a valuation of $100bn, most of which revenues come from China. Unlike most Chinese companies, its investors include US venture capitalists eager to see ByteDance ersify.TikTok has grown quickly in Britain and already employs 800 people in the UK and Ireland, out of a total of 1,000 in Europe. It is estimated to have 3.7m active users in the UK, each spending on average 41 minutes a day with the app.A ByteDance spokesperson said: “ByteDance is committed to being a global company. In light of the current situation, ByteDance has been evaluating the possibility of establishing TikTok’s headquarters outside of the US, to better serve our global users.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60901d10061e7c75e0f6b090449312dcc1913d7e/0_54_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa6ff348dda3fe2e3c9a07c46b57932","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

Kennedy, a progressive activist and former Sanders operative, has switched to support Joe Biden, who will this week become the Democratic nominee for president. But Kennedy worries whether Biden can win over valuable young progressives underwhelmed by his moderate politics.“Bernie talked directly to people’s material needs,” said Kennedy. The clear populist promises of universal healthcare and cancelling student debt in particular caught fire, Kennedy said.And expansive outreach and slogans like ‘¡Nuestro Futuro, Nuestra Lucha!’ — Our Future, Our Struggle – clicked with the cohort who nicknamed Sanders “Tío Bernie” (Uncle Bernie).For the first time, Latinos are poised to be the nation’s largest non-white ethnic voting bloc in the 2020 election, with a large young cohort among the estimated 32 million eligible to vote – a record.Democrats know that their support is crucial to winning the White House – and potentially both chambers of Congress – but concerns remain over whether Biden can not only persuade young progressives who were energized by Sanders, but mobilize Latinos in decisive numbers at a moment when the coronavirus and economic crises are disproportionately hurting communities of color.“The Biden campaign must reach young people,” María Teresa Kumar, the president of Voto Latino, a political organization focused on voter engagement. “Because if you’re not reaching young people, you are not reaching the Latino community.”“When I worked for Bernie, it wasn’t about electing one person. It was about a movement,” Belén Sisa, a former Sanders press secretary, said. “I don’t feel that from Joe Biden.”Since the primary, Biden has appeared to move to the left on key policies important to young Latinos. He has embraced a $2tn climate plan, though not the Green New Deal, and pledged an ambitious overhaul of Trump’s immigration orders, and an economic agenda centered on racial equality.“We’ve moved the needle a bit,” Sisa said.But, like many progressives, she is frustrated by Biden’s reluctance to embrace Medicare for All, the universal healthcare policy that she says would reduce health disparities for Latinos, who are among the country’s most uninsured. And he has refused to embrace calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency carrying out hardline Trump anti-immigration policies at the US-Mexico border and in raids in US cities.Sisa also said Sanders’ campaign invested more resources and time, much earlier, to cultivate Latino voters.Chuck Rocha, the architect of Sanders’ ambitious Latino outreach strategy, is now applying some of the tactics used to win Hiics voters in primary contests from Iowa to California, to help Biden beat Trump in November.After Biden won the primary, Rocha founded Nuestro Pac, a Democratic Super Pac that will target Latino voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania.The Biden campaign recently made other high-profile hires including Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the granddaughter of civil rights hero Cesar Chavez, and Matt Barreto, the founder of Latino Decisions, a top Democratic polling firm. The campaign has also hired Republican strategist Ana Navarro.Biden’s platform aimed at Hiic voters – “Todos con Biden” – focuses on healthcare, education and reversing Trump’s anti-immigration agenda. Biden has promised to reinstate the Daca program of rights and protections for undocumented young people, and send a bill to Congress “on day one” that would create a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US.He has also pledged a 100-day moratorium on deportations.During the primary campaign, Biden was repeatedly confronted by immigration activists who demanded contrition for the more than 3 million deportations carried out while he was vice-president.“You should vote for Trump,” Biden told one critic. Weeks later, he was obliged to apologize for the “pain” caused by the policies.He described the Biden-Harris ticket as “looking to the future, and the changing demographics in the United States”.The campaign hailed Harris’s efforts to stop the Trump administration separating undocumented families crossing the US-Mexico border and “sponsoring legislation to help victims of Hurricane Maria”, which decimated Puerto Rico in 2017.But her  record as district attorney and attorney general in California has prompted disquiet among some progressives.Meanwhile, leading Democratic figures say Trump’s handling of the public heath crisis and the economic slump, allied to his xenophobia, is driving voters away from the Republicans.“Donald Trump’s cruelty is backfiring on him,” said Julián Castro, who was the only Latino candidate in the Democratic primary race.Castro believes frustration with the president could have a significant effect in battleground states such as Arizona, Florida and his native Texas, where coronavirus is wreaking havoc.“More people are getting sick, and more people are dying,” said Castro, whose stepmother died from coronavirus. “That’s not going unnoticed.”And yet strategists say antipathy for Trump is not enough. “It has to be ‘this is why you should vote for Joe Biden’,” said Nathalie Rayes, the president and chief executive of Latino Victory.Elsewhere, voting by mail, likely the safest way to cast a ballot during a pandemic, presents another hurdle for Latino voters. Overall, Latinos have said they had little experience and low confidence in the security of voting by mail, according to the Latino Decisions survey.“That was a big code red for us,” said Kumar. “Especially where there is no habit of voting by mail.”The Biden campaign has pivoted sharply to Latinos, but is it too little too late?Cristóbal Alex, Biden’s senior campaign adviser, and the former president of the Latino Victory Fund, said Latinos are “essential” to winning the White House.“We’ve brought in the A-team to ensure that we engage Latinos and compete for every single vote as we go into November,” he said. “That’s a very dramatic scale-up in staffing, and that’s also being reflected in the organizing at every level of the campaign. It’s an indication of just how seriously the campaign takes the Latino vote.”Alex said it is understandable that in the midst of a national crisis, which he says has been made worse by Trump’s extraordinarily isive presidency, many Latinos are not yet fully engaged in the election. But he is confident that will change.Over the past several weeks, the campaign has significantly ramped up its outreach, touting a “culturally competent” advertising strategy that includes younger English speakers and older Spanish speakers.In an effort to reflect the ersity of the Hiic electorate, the campaign is “micro-targeting” Latinos by region and ethnicity. For example, the narrator in an ad running in Arizona has a Mexican accent, while the same ad running in Miami features a narrator with a Cuban accent. But some say, as a strategy, it needs more fine tuning.The temporary protected status (TPS) government program is designed to prevent foreign nationals from being deported back to countries facing threatening conditions such as civil unrest or the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster.Microtargeting with accents is a “necessary” principle of outreach, said De Jesus, and has been used since Obama’s 2008 run to the White House. But more cultural nuances need to be included now, De Jesus said. He pointed at a successful ad by the Trump campaign after liberals began to boycott Goya, the canned food brand, citing its impressive depth and authenticity.“Its content was reprehensible, but it used a specific slang that a millennial Puerto Rican woman would use. So it’s not just the accent or the policy, but the words and the music,” said De Jesus.Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is due to speak at the Democratic national convention this week, fresh from being a member of the Biden-Sanders policy taskforce created after the primary in an effort to unify the party against Trump. Sanders, Michael Bloomberg and Andrew Yang will speak, too, but as of Friday, Julián Castro had not been scheduled.And with the stakes so high, the latest ad from the group America’s Progressive Promise is narrated by Sanders, who says: “Every person who voted for me or the other candidates … understands that Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in the history of our country.”“It’s absolutely imperative that we come together and defeat him, and defeat him badly.”The spot concludes by declaring that Biden would be “the most progressive president since FDR”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bda6d1a1d43ffd7e867b11f490c0bf95","title":"republican democratic party conventions","story":"With Democrats and Republicans holding no in-person conventions this year, some have called to ditch them completely – but others say they’re a vital political toolThere won’t be any huge balloon drops at the Democratic or Republican party conventions this year. Presidential candidates will not get the chance to accept their nominations in front of massive, cheering crowds. Political reporters and strategists will not descend on a carefully selected American city to kick off the final stretch of the 2020 presidential election.And some in Washington say those changes may be for the best.The coronavirus pandemic has upended plans for both nominating conventions, which will unfold over the next two weeks – Democrats first, then Republicans. Both nominees – Donald Trump and Joe Biden – will deliver their acceptance speeches remotely, and attendance at the two conventions has been sharply restricted. About 50,000 people attended each convention in 2016, a mere fraction of that number are expected to this year.Rather than mourning the loss of the in-person convention, some commentators have suggested that the unique nature of this year’s events may represent an opportunity to re-evaluate an outdated tradition. But leaders of both parties insist the conventions still serve a vital purpose of informing voters about the presidential nominees and their platforms.While the conventions have been held since 1831, they have become increasingly anticlimactic in recent decades. No convention has gone to a second ballot since 1952, and the last legitimate, although unsuccessful, effort to seize the nomination at a convention took place in 1980.Now, a convention mainly serves as a party’s stamp of approval on its already-chosen nominee. The four days of events have turned into an intricately coordinated infomercial for each party’s nominee, featuring a lineup of speeches from longtime lawmakers and rising stars.“Once you have the introduction of the more open primary process to select the candidates, the conventions then become about presenting a more unified party to the American public and more about what they’re going to stand for in the election,” Brownell said.Those shifting dynamics have translated into decreasing interest, at least among television networks. The days of “gavel-to-gavel” coverage are long gone, and networks in recent years have instead devoted just one hour of primetime coverage to the conventions each night.In an editorial published earlier this month, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s editorial board argued the conventions had devolved into a “half-hearted spectacle of too many dull speeches and too many TV talking-heads spouting repetitive gossip and gibberish”.The board wrote: “It is a bit sad to lose the tradition of the political convention. But, in truth, it died, like the dodo, long ago.”Despite that waning interest, party leaders push back against claims that conventions are relics of a bygone political era. “I think there’s still a remarkable importance to coming together in a city,” the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, said last week. “I think there’s a lot of value in that.”For the host cities themselves, there is economic value. The 2016 conventions generated roughly $200m in revenue for Cleveland and Philadelphia, but this year’s host cities – Charlotte and Milwaukee – will not see the same bump now that the events are mostly virtual.Perez also argued the traditional convention represented an invaluable opportunity for party members to gather and discuss their priorities. “There is often no substitute for that interaction that you get and the learning that you do,” Perez said.That sentiment was echoed by political strategists on both sides of the aisle, several of whom said they expected the conventions to return to their traditional format once it was safe to host large events.“That’s the kind of kinetic energy that is untranslatable. You’ve got to be in the room. You’ve got to feel that,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “It sets up the shockwave the nominee wants to send out to the country.”Steele and others said there was no replacement for the excitement of nominees delivering their acceptance speeches to thousands of cheering fans. Democrats in particular are losing the opportunity to celebrate California senator Kamala Harris’ historic achievement, as she becomes the first Black woman and first Asian American to join a major party’s presidential ticket.“We’re all lamenting that that moment in history will not be captured in the traditional convention stage way,” said Leah Daughtry, who ran the 2008 and 2016 Democratic conventions.Both Daughtry and Henry Barbour, Mississippi’s national committeeman to the RNC, also noted that the conventions allow delegates, who represent some of the most ardent members of each party, to come together for training and networking.“The opportunity for the grassroots workers to go to a national convention and be around people who share their passion and love of politics is important,” Barbour said. “It serves as a great reward to the workers in the party.”Barbour is one of just 336 delegates who will still convene in Charlotte to formally nominate Trump, and he is missing the convention hoopla of past years. “It’s just not going to have the impact that 2016 and other years have had, and so I think we’ll get back to that,” Barbour said.However, even if in-person conventions return in 2024, this year could still represent an opportunity to reconsider how they are held. Democrats, for example, are allowing virtual delegate voting for the first time, which could expand participation in future conventions as well.Daughtry, who virtually cast her delegate vote for Biden last week, also suggested shortening conventions. “My prediction is that they will be one or two days, not four, because the business of the convention can really be accomplished in just a few hours,” Daughtry said.Steele was similarly open to shorter conventions, and he argued that social media could help make the events feel less scripted. “I’m watching to see how social media generates and creates that spontaneity or brings some of that back in future convention settings,” Steele said. “Because you can’t control what someone’s tweeting from the floor.”Despite some calls to end the political tradition, Steele expressed optimism that the parties could find ways to resurrect the interest sparked by earlier conventions. “They’re boring, but they are necessary,” Steele said. “I don’t think they need to be necessarily boring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e497ff667da51d87bcab9cd0fcf126521d86e1b/0_229_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71518758036f53aa708fbe5b100d4f22","title":"sanders praises kamala harris biden asset","story":"Bernie Sanders says Harris is ‘incredibly smart, tough, and I would not want to be Vice-President Pence in a debate with her’Bernie Sanders praised Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s pick for his running mate on Sunday, as the Democratic party attempted to project an image of unity ahead of this week’s national convention, where Biden is set to be officially nominated as the party’s presidential candidate.Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator who clashed with both Biden and Harris earlier this year when the three were vying for their party’s presidential nomination, lauded Harris as “an asset”.“I think she’s an asset for the Biden campaign and I think she’s going to do great on the campaign trail.”The Democratic National Convention (DNC), and its Republican counterpart (RNC), are traditionally two of the most high-profile weeks of the US election cycle – a mix of political business, theater and party, in both senses of the word.Tens of thousands of people usually attend the week-long events. Party delegates from across the country converge on a city to hold meetings and events. They fill a big arena to say something prideful about their state and cheer wildly for the party\u0027s candidate for president, who officially receives the nomination here.During the convention, politicians andor celebrities give speeches in support of the party’s candidate, who gives a rousing speech to cap it all off.This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the DNC will be completely different. Almost all aspects have moved online.\u0026nbspBillie Eilish\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspJohn Legend\u0026nbspare among the celebrity performers, and key speakers will include presidential nominee, Joe Biden, his running mate, Kamala Harris, political power couples the Obamas and the Clintons, and progressive superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\u0026nbspSanders, the last candidate running before Biden secured enough votes to win the nomination during the primary campaign, has previously been vocal in his criticism of his more moderate rivals, attacking their stances on universal healthcare in particular.Sanders’ former press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, tweeted that the Democrats’ choice of Harris, a California senator and the state’s former attorney general who she called a “top cop”, showed contempt for the party’s base at a time of renewed anti-police protests across the US.Sanders, however, said the party was united in its goal. “Obviously there may be disagreements, a lot of my supporters are not enthusiastic about Joe Biden,” he said.“But I think there is an overwhelming understanding that Donald Trump must be defeated, Biden must be elected, and the day after he is elected we will do everything we can to create a government that works for all of us.”Cory Booker, Democratic senator for New Jersey and another former candidate for the nomination, defended Harris, who is biracial and identifies as Black, against recent attacks from Trump that she was “extraordinarily nasty,”, “a horrible woman,” and “mean”.“The words the president has been using reflects the demeaning, degrading language he’s used about Blacks,” he said on Sunday.“Donald Trump can pick a fight if he wants but he’s the proverbial bully in the playground that’s about to get knocked out when he steps up against this dynamic duo that will beat him in November.”The convention comes as Trump faces mounting criticism over the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 170,000 people in the US and infected more than 5.3 million, according to Johns Hopkins – more than any other country in the world by far.In recent days Trump has also been under fire for attacking the US Postal Service and mail-in voting, both of which will be crucial for minimizing the risk to voters in the November election.Sanders told NBC’s Meet the Press that Congress needed to act fast to address the issue.“This, again, is not a debate about the Postal Service alone,” Sanders said. “That’s important. This is about the future of American democracy and whether people have a right to participate.”“This is a crisis for American democracy,” Sanders added. “We have got to act and act now.”Biden and Harris will formally accept their party’s nomination this week at the culmination of the four-day convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The event, which begins Monday, was planned as a jamboree with delegates from every state but was massively scaled down to a mostly virtual gathering by the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican national convention is due to take place next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5420e646c4edb197d5c3871a475805ed78a8b065/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98005456156c213022556df3721cadcd","title":"us inequality coronavirus pandemic unemployment","story":"US billionaires’ wealth is soaring while millions remain unemployed, creating a country with two economies and increased inequalityby  Dominic Rushe in New YorkIt’s only a hundred miles from Manhattan to East Hampton but as the city swelters the Long Island town can seem a world away. Cool Atlantic breezes take the heat off long summer days spent on its miles of white, soft sand beaches. High-priced farm stands provide heirloom tomatoes, peaches and arugula to summer visitors and the mansions of the financial titans and the celebrities, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Julianne Moore and Robert Downey Jr, who summer there.If anything, quite the opposite. House prices are soaring. High-priced rentals have all been snapped up. It took developer Joe Farrell just one day to rent Sandcastle, his 15-bedroom mansion with sunken tennis courts, for $2m for the summer to “a textile tycoon and his family who were stuck in Manhattan and wanted to leave the city on a day’s notice. This was a Covid situation – not a normal summer rental”, he told the New York Post.The Hamptons really is a world away for Sara Fearrington. It may as well be another planet. The 43-year-old lost her job at Waffle House in Durham, North Carolina, when the pandemic struck. Now she, her husband and their six children are trying to make ends meet on $125 in unemployment benefits each week. Fearrington is one of the 2.6 million people to have lost her job in the food services and drinking industry since February.The Fearringtons had been receiving an extra $600 a week in benefits thanks to an emergency lifeline set up by Congress in March. That expired at the end of July and Washington is deadlocked over a replacement. “Now we literally have to sit here and wait, your head on a chopping block,” she said.Once again coronavirus has shown that it is far more deadly for those suffering from pre-existing conditions. For the US body politic that pre-existing condition is inequality.Stock markets are setting new highs driven by soaring prices for the tech companies that enable those lucky enough to work from home. Apple is close to being valued at $2tn. The total wealth of US billionaires has soared $685bn since the middle of March to a combined $3.65tn. Rock-bottom interest rates have triggered a home sales boom for some as those with the money reconsider their priorities in the work-from-home era. With nowhere to go, those Americans who can are saving at record rates.“It’s white-collar professionals who are able to work from home. In some ways, this is a sign that the economy is just officially split in two,” Glenn Kelman, chief executive of property company Redfin, told NPR last week.“We are all in this together” may be the rallying cry for the pandemic but the truth is the poor, and particularly people of color, have been devastated by coronavirus and its attendant recession while the wealthy have weathered it and in some cases made huge gains. Research into previous recent pandemics from economists at the International Monetary Fund suggests it’s a trend that may continue even after the outbreak abates.Economists often talk of V-shaped economic recoveries, a sharp drop and an equally sharp bounce back. Sometimes the economy drags along the bottom before bouncing back – a U-shaped recovery. Now there is talk of a “K-shaped” recovery. A fall followed by a split where the well off and well educated tick up while the poor and poorly educated fall further behind.For people able to work from home, “life has returned largely to normal”, said Peter Atwater, adjunct lecturer in the economics department at William \u0026amp Mary. “In fact, the wealthiest today are even richer than they were before the outbreak.”For those people, on the arm of the K, Atwater said it’s “almost as if the outbreak never happened. That’s starkly different for people on the leg. If you are a small business person, work in the service industry, had to go back out into a manufacturing facility, a job in the ‘real world’, as it were, that has weighed heavily. Sadly it has weighed particularly heavily on minority communities at a time when they are the largest populations experiencing the outbreak. It’s a stacked inequity.”In Edgar Allan Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death Prince Prospero and the knights and dames of his court retire to “the deep seclusion of one of his crenellated abbeys” to escape the Red Death, a plague that is devastating the country around them.Amply provisioned and, so they think, sealed off from the outside world, Prospero and his pod put on a masqued ball but the prince is angered to find that one of the guests has dressed as Red Death.Prospero chases the guest from room to room, only to realize the figure is the Red Death personified. The guests sicken and die: “And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.”Inequality was a pre-existing condition for the US economy long before the coronavirus started its spread. For Fearrington the pandemic has merely exposed its “ugly face”. But she is certain that if this goes on much longer today’s Prosperos too will see that face.A Fight for $15 activist campaigning for a rise in the national minimum wage, Fearrington is hopeful that as so many people come to realize how bad the situation has become, something will change. “What we have right now is economic failure,” she said.“My husband is black. We are a mixed family that is living through this struggle. It is not a fun place to be. I have been with my husband for 28 years. Twenty-eight years and I am still seeing the same problems? No. We have got to speak up. I have had enough.”She has seen the reports of people snapping up second homes. “I have dreams of that too,” she said. “I am happy for people who have that. I want everybody to prosper. But at the same time I feel left behind. Some of my dreams are now halted.” She said “every little bit of savings” she had stowed away has gone “just to keep our heads above water”.Even before Covid-19 life was hard for Fearrington. She worked 42-72 hours a week, taking all the shifts she could get. “Every holiday. Every one of my kids’ birthdays, I was working.” Paid $3.15 an hour before tips she could make $40-$70 a day. The family needed every dollar. Medical costs are a constant fear. Her husband has a rare lung disease, ABPA. His inhalers can cost $300. One stay in hospital left the family with a bill for $15,000. “If you get sick, too bad, so sad,” she said.“We need healthcare for all,” she said. “A lot of things have to change, we need to learn to live together. Just because we fall in a certain pay bracket doesn’t mean our lives are less valuable than anybody else’s.”The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Fight for $15, #MeToo and Occupy Wall Street are all recent examples of powerful, popular movements demanding real change. The continuing protests across America following the killing of George Floyd and the fact that more white people too are joining those protests gives her hope. “Now is a time when people are recognising that silence has not worked. We are coming together. Ugliness has to stop,” she said.Without change there will be more outrage, said Atwater. “I don’t think the wealthy appreciate how vulnerable they are to those who are out in the real world. They are not immune to the world around them.”If the current situation continues, “there is a very real risk that companies will start looking at their balance sheets and thinking, ‘Actually, we really need to trim our workforce’, and that could happen across the board. That’s not just confined to leisure and hospitality,” said John Payne, economist at Oxford Economics.Widening job losses and increasing inequality is likely to lead to louder calls for change.“We talk about the American dream, the ability to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Rags to riches. All this American mythology is being challenged by this extraordinary wealth ide,” said Atwater. “The rubber band has been pulled too far. People are uncomfortable with how ided we have become.“At the same time I don’t think the wealthy appreciate how vulnerable they are to those who are out in the real world. They are not immune to the world around them.”That realization can’t come soon enough for Fearrington: “It has to stop. We are still all humans at the end of the day,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36170db42e3a436d4349b2cb09b78fde55877cd3/0_343_5174_3106/master/5174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81ec2e42b744a3aba8814e63051b2c5e","title":"go hard go early now new zealand goes back to the drawing board","story":"City of Auckland is under coronavirus lockdown – and ahead of election the government is being criticised over border control, quarantine and testingWhen scientists in Auckland began modelling an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city’s densely populated southern regions – situated right by the country’s main international airport – they hoped they were participating in a drill scenario.“This is exactly the type of outbreak we were worried about, and in fact it’s exactly what happened,” said Professor Shaun Hendy, who works modelling the progression of the disease for the government.Just last week New Zealand celebrated a significant milestone: 100 days free of the deadly disease, which has claimed 800,000 lives worldwide and 22 in New Zealand.But as the seemingly successful elimination strategy was being lauded, both domestically and overseas, the virus was stealthily circulating through the community, with at least one victim falling ill with symptoms as early as 31 July.Three of the person’s family members became infected in the next two weeks but a positive test was not returned until 11 August, by which time dozens more people in the country’s largest city – and its economic powerhouse – had fallen ill.The latest outbreak is a huge blow for the island nation, heralded as a global success story for effectively eliminating the virus in June after a tough seven-week lockdown, which, like similar lockdowns around the world, led to a growth in unemployment, a spike in domestic violence and a surge in mental health problems.“Go hard and go early” was New Zealand’s motto, and combined with strict border controls and high compliance with lockdown measures from “the team of 5 million” it seemed to have worked. Until now.“I was gutted obviously. We had reached 100 days so it does feel like a kick in the teeth,” said Dr Siousxie Wiles, a British microbiologist and science communicator who lives in Auckland, a city of 1.5 million.“But we know that with people coming in there is the chance this would happen.”Wiles praised the government’s resurgence strategy as “absolutely spot-on” and said it had shown an impressive ability to adapt and move swiftly through alert levels.“They have been very fast and very transparent. The speed which they moved people up the alert levels really frightened people, but this is the way to do it. What we will see now is: how quickly can you stamp out an outbreak?”The prime minister made the decision for Auckland to re-enter lockdown six hours after the first positive test result came back – light years ahead of the likes of Vietnam, South Korea, and the Australian state of Victoria all of whom were slower to reinstate lockdown.This decisiveness has won her widespread praise, apart from the opposition who said they should have been consulted.On Friday afternoon Ardern announced a softer resurgence plan than many had expected, one that will allow the economy – even in Auckland – to cope, if not flourish.Tracking and tracing cases related to the south Auckland cluster is the priority, and New Zealand police have been drafted in to help investigate the source or “index case” that kicked it off, with efforts focusing on the borders and the Ports of Auckland area, as well as a cool store facility that handled international freight in the city’s west.In addition, active cases are being quarantined in government-run hotels – a new measure adopted from some south Asian countries.Testing in the community has been ramped up with 30,000 tests conducted in 48 hours and labs working 24 hours. Auckland will remain at level 3 for an additional two weeks, giving health authorities time to test and track everyone related to the outbreak. The rest of the country will remain at level 2.The resurgence plan has earned the approval of epidemiologists, and so far, the compliance of the general public.But the fact it has to be enacted at all is being viewed as a major failure for the Labour coalition government, who are now just five weeks out from a general election. Attention is turning to the borders, where more than 30,000 people have entered a fortnight of mandatory quarantine on returning to New Zealand.Management of the dozens of quarantine hotels has long been lambasted as “shambolic” by the opposition, after a series of people escaped the facilities and made trips to the liquor store and supermarket, prompting the police and army to start regular patrols.In other cases, perhaps as many as 1,000 of them, returning New Zealanders were allowed to leave the facilities without being tested.Wiles called the oversight “deeply disappointing” while the Otago university epidemiologist Sir David Skegg said it was “extraordinary” that border workers were not being tested weekly, on a compulsory basis.“We haven’t been doing weekly testing of workers, so I think that may have turned out to be a missed opportunity to avoid this lockdown,” Professor Hendy said.Skegg agreed and called the government’s handling of the border complacent.“I think it is absolutely vital for our elimination status that we have the most stringent protections at the border.”The health minister, Chris Hipkins, has said all border workers would be tested for the virus by the weekend, but with the disease having circulated in the community for up to two weeks, the horse has well and truly bolted.In Auckland compliance with lockdown measures has been high, even as the city haemorrhages money – a calculated NZ$150m in the last three days alone.Zafer Isiklar is a cafe owner in the Auckland suburb of Mt Eden. He believes this outbreak is the result of incompetence. “They didn’t control the borders or manage quarantine well,” Isiklar said.The region of south Auckland is one of the most densely populated in the country, and the suburb of the latest outbreak is a mere 14km from the country’s only international airport.Hundreds of airport and border workers live in south Auckland, and its proximity to quarantine hotels also had it under Covid modellers’ microscope as a high-risk site for a potential outbreak.According to Statistics New Zealand half of all New Zealand’s overcrowded homes are in Auckland, with the highest rates in south Auckland. Pacific and Māori people are the most likely to live in overcrowded homes. If it was going to happen anywhere, it was here.But Hendy said there were some silver linings to New Zealand’s outbreak, and the prime minister has stressed that things are not complex or severe enough to warrant a level 4 nationwide lockdown, as so far the outbreak is limited to a single cluster.“We definitely have had the benefit of learning from what has happened in other countries,” Hendy said.“The Melbourne example was quite instructive. We learnt that suburban lockdown just didn’t work.”The prime minister has said that New Zealand will be building on it’s earlier success, which she calls “evidence-based”, “following the philosophy of hard and early.”“As we have said from the start, our overall Covid-19 strategy remains elimination. That means stamping out the virus whenever it comes back,” Ardern said.“We have been world-leading in our Covid response – we can do all of that again.”For Aucklander Craig Shearer, a software-developer from Hobsonville, any “science-based approach to handling the pandemic” wins his approval.“I think we have dodged a bullet,” Shearer says.Additional reporting by Phil Taylor in Auckland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9710d712a3936bc27b1db6cbc5aa762d9d6a386/0_33_4609_2764/master/4609.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a350f335fffb8b62c9bbb65c026fe878","title":"island nations have the edge in keeping covid away or most do","story":"Nations from New Zealand to Cuba closed borders promptly with strict quarantine rules, but the UK won’t admit its ‘serious mistake’Island nations have an advantage when it comes to stopping travellers importing disease, be it Covid or other infections.Seas are usually harder to cross than land, and beaches are easier to police. There are no cross-border towns, and fewer ways to sneak over frontiers.These advantages, combined with strict quarantine policies, have made island nations some of the most successful at containing Covid. But the ones that did best had shut themselves off from the world to varying degrees. And a fresh outbreak of cases in New Zealand last week suggests coronavirus can evade even tight controls.Experts say the lack of special border measures in the UK ahead of lockdown was a “serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. Even now, the UK’s quarantine measures – for selected countries and with limited enforcement – appear to be nowhere near as comprehensive or effective as those used by other island nations.Stringent border controls helped New Zealand eliminate Covid within three months. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern sealed its borders to all but its own citizens in March and has kept them closed with a handful of exceptions. All new arrivals have to spend two weeks in quarantine, originally paid for by the government but now self-funded.The country declared itself Covid-free in June, and until this month the few new cases identified were among travellers in quarantine. Last week, though, a new cluster emerged in Auckland, with 37 cases reported so far. Authorities have not been able to trace its origin tests so far show it is not linked to either the March-April outbreak or the known imported cases.477 cases 7 deathsTaiwan’s experience of Sars meant it was prepared to act fast. In February it banned visitors from China, and in March from the rest of the world. It was one of the first places where life returned to something like normal. Now, all new arrivals spend two weeks in quarantine – non-residents in designated hotels, where they stay in one room, with a “digital fence” monitoring their location, and regular check-ins about health and temperature required. Fines for breaching quarantine are up to a million Taiwanese dollars. Business travellers can apply for a shorter quarantine period if they get a negative Covid test.344 cases10 deathsMauritius is one of the few countries that hasn’t seen a local transmission for months, thanks largely to an extremely strict quarantine regime. Borders were sealed in March, and apart from Mauritians stranded abroad, remain closed. Every new arrival has quarantined for 14 days. The shut-down devastated the tourism industry, and authorities are working on reopening, possibly with airport testing for all.After borders closed in late March,Cuba’s underfunded but well-staffed healthcare system helped with track and trace, and controls were strictly enforced. The island has been largely Covid-free since June and in July, in need of foreign currency it reopened hotels on off-shore islets, promising a virus-free holiday. Few visitors have yet returned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ee83c99d70e6f54a5898fb0e395a3b94b9f95ae/0_8_5472_3286/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3574f0b8d7562abda0552bd790efe3e5","title":"israel and uae open phone link after historic deal","story":"Connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the agreement made last week to establish diplomatic ties A telephone service between the United Arab Emirates and Israel has begun working as the two countries opened diplomatic ties, part of a deal brokered by the US that required Israel to suspend its contentious plan to annex the West Bank.UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan called his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, in what Israel hailed as an important step.Congratulating the UAE on “removing the blocks”, Israeli communications minister Yoaz Handel issued a statement on Sunday saying: “Many economic opportunities will open now, and these trust-building steps are an important step toward advancing states’ interests.”Associated Press journalists in Jerusalem and Dubai were able to call each other from both landline and mobile phones registered to Israel’s country code +972 from around 1.15pm.Also on Sunday, Israeli news websites that had previously been blocked by UAE authorities, such as the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and YNet, could be accessed without using means to bypass internet filtering in the Emirates.In the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, a recorded message in Arabic and English would typically play prior to Sunday saying calls to +972 numbers could not be connected. The advent of internet calling allowed people to get around the ban, although these too were often interrupted.Some in Israel used Palestinian mobile phones with +970 numbers, which those in the UAE could call.The connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the deal between the Emiratis and Israelis.Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday they were establishing full diplomatic relations in the US-brokered accord.The historic deal delivered a foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about arch enemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Palestinians say it puts a just resolution of the Middle East conflict even farther out of reach by undermining an Arab consensus that recognition of Israel only come in return for concessions in peace talks. That removes a rare source of leverage for the Palestinians.The agreement will make the UAE the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to have full, active diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE and Israel announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between the two countries were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.Early on Sunday, the Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency announced a UAE company had signed an agreement with an Israeli company for research and study of the coronavirus pandemic.The move has sparked anger among some who see it as a betrayal of longstanding efforts to establish an independent state of Palestinians. In Pakistan, hundreds of Islamists rallied on Sunday to denounce the Emirati-Israeli deal. The Jamaat-e-Islami party chanted slogans against the US and burned effigies of Trump. They also set ablaze American and Israeli flags.The deal also has enraged Iran and Turkey, regional rivals of the UAE.On Sunday, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces called the UAE’s decision a “disaster”. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri urged Abu Dhabi to “revise” its position.“If an incident happens in the Persian Gulf and violates the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, even a tiny bit, and we see it from the UAE, we will not tolerate it,” Bagheri said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/916b8df7c2151d74613f8929357507de298a6fe3/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592bcc30eea4a7715d6e850ff744dc3b","title":"victory in japan day 75th anniversary in pictures","story":"VJ Day marks 75 years since Japan surrendered to the allied forces on 15 August 1945, ending hostilities in the second world war"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073d0365ed7e8fc71a4d3b48e46b4f1bc05c1cc5/0_44_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee2b0c8d2fd96476d19860aae564cb8","title":"coronavirus live news australia close to vaccine deal england scraps public health agency","story":"New French cases exceed 3,000 for second day localised restrictions in north of England may soon be eased Italy closes all discos.

Deaths rose by 483 on Sunday, with Florida, Texas and Louisiana leading the rise in fatalities. The US has at least 5.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases in total, the highest in the world and likely an undercount as the country still has not ramped up testing to the recommended levels.Cases are falling in most states except for Hawaii, South Dakota and Illinois. Public health officials and authorities are concerned about a possible fall resurgence in cases amid the start of the flu season, which will likely exacerbate efforts to treat the coronavirus. Centers for Disease Control director Robert Redfield warned the US may be in for its “worst fall” if the public does not follow health guidelines in an interview with Web MD. Months into the pandemic, the US economic recovery from the recession triggered by the outbreak is still staggered, with some hot spots slowing their reopenings and others shutting down businesses. Worldwide there are at least 21.5 million coronavirus cases and over 765,000 confirmed deaths. The United States remains the global epicenter of the virus, with around a quarter of the cases and deaths. Jacinda Ardern is coming to the end of this news conference. She says she had never considered moving the election out by a year, as she said some other countries have done. “We are not proposing to push out for a long period of time,” she says, reiterating that the vote will still happen in the constitutional time allocated for this parliament.She acknowledges the potential anxiety caused by delaying the election, but says she wants to assure all voters that their voices will be heard on election day.New Zealand spent 102 days with no new cases of Covid-19, until last week, when four new cases in the city of Auckland were reported. This city was returned to Level-3 lockdown rules - initially for 3 days, but that was extended on Friday out to 26 August. The rest of the country is alert level 2. As of Sunday, there were 69 active cases of Covid-19, including 49 cases from the community.New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has moved the general election to 17 October, a month later than the original date of 19 September.Ardern says the biggest risk to overcome will be ensuring 25,000 election workers are well-protected as they go about their work.Ardern said she considered moving the election by just 2 weeks, but the election commission said this wasn’t enough time for them to prepare for the new date.“I am proposing that parliament reconvene tomorrow,” Ardern said, “Under the circumstances, I consider it important that parliament can consider these issues.”Parliament will now dissolve on 6 September.Advance voting will start on Saturday, 3 October.The governor-general has been advised of the new election date.“Covid is the world’s new normal,” Ardern said. “I know the uncertainty Covid has caused is incredibly difficult...I do not intend to change the election date again.”Israel’s ministerial committee for the coronavirus crisis relaxed some social distancing restrictions on Sunday, allowing up to 20 people to gather in an indoor space regardless of its size, after some backlash from restaurant owners who claim they were particularly hit by them, the Haaretz newspaper reports.The new regulations, to go into effect on Monday at 7pm, will also allow gatherings of up to 30 people in an open space.The number of total coronavirus cases in the country rose to 92,680 on Sunday, of which 23,491 are active, while the death toll has risen to 685. There are 382 patients in serious condition. A committee leading the coronavirus response in Israel’s Arab society reported a rise of about 1,600 new cases within a week, bringing the total number of cases among Israeli Arabs, not including East Jerusalem and mixed Jewish-Arab cities, to 9,908, with 3,600 of them considered active cases.Officials say one of the main reasons for the rise in cases are large gatherings in weddings, in spite of restrictions in place limiting crowds. Tight localised coronavirus restrictions in some parts of the North of England could be lifted this week, after around 4.5 million people in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were subjected to a new lockdown more than two weeks ago in a bid to contain local infection clusters.Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told the Daily Mirror newspaper that he believes rules banning people from mixing with other households in homes or gardens will be relaxed, possibly borough-by-borough, and depending on infection rates.He said: “Hopefully, we will begin to see some people getting released.“If things stay as they are I think it is likely that we would see a change.”Burnham said that while curbs would remain and possibly tighten in the worst-hit areas, they would be eased in parts where cases have dropped.“Our cases are flattening – with one exception, Oldham – and we are starting to turn the tide in most of our boroughs. The hope is, maybe we will have a better time ahead of us,” he said, adding that numbers could “change quite dramatically in four, five days,” and would be reviewed weekly.Brazil on Sunday reported 23,101 new coronavirus infections, taking the overall tally to 3,340,197.The country recorded a further 620 Covid-19 deaths over a 24 hour period, according to the health ministry.107,852 people are now confirmed to have died from coronavirus in Brazil.Brazil has the world’s second-worst Covid-19 outbreak after the United States.On Friday, the Philippines imposed a temporary ban on poultry meat imports from Brazil, after two cities in China found traces of coronavirus in cargoes of imported frozen food, including chicken wings from the South American country, Reuters reported.The governor of the US state of Georgia, who has opposed local mask mandates and even sued over one in Atlanta, has signed a new executive order that allows local governments to enact mask requirements to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.As with previous orders, the one issued Saturday says residents and visitors of the state are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings when they are outside of their homes, except when eating, drinking or exercising outside. But unlike previous orders, this one allows local governments in counties that have reached a threshold requirement to require the wearing of masks on government-owned property, the Associated Press reports.A county meets that threshold requirement if it has had 100 or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days. Only two of Georgia’s 159 counties were below that threshold, according to data from the state Department of Public Health.Local mask mandates cannot result in fines, fees or penalties against private businesses or organisations, and penalties against iniduals for non-compliance cannot included a fine greater than $50 and cannot include prison time, the order says.Local mask requirements can’t be enforced on residential property and can only be enforced on private property, including businesses, if the owner or occupant consents to enforcement, the order says.This order also protects Georgia businesses from government overreach by restricting the application and enforcement of local masking requirements to public property,” governor Brian Kemp said in a news release accompanying the order, which is in effect through 31 August. “While I support local control, it must be properly balanced with property rights and personal freedoms,” he added.Jordan will seal off a city near the Syrian border from Monday following the largest daily rise in four months in coronavirus infections, which officials say have come mainly from its northern neighbour. The health ministry said half of the 39 cases recorded in the last 24 hours were from Ramtha city, near the Syrian border. Officials say truck drivers and iniduals entering the kingdom from the Jaber border crossing with Syria are spreading the virus. Ramtha will be isolated as of Monday with the authorities re-imposing restrictions on movement in the first such reversal of a provincial area since the authorities eased a nationwide lockdown last June, Reuters reports. Jordan, with one of the lowest infection cases in the region, has reported 1,378 cases and 11 deaths from Covid-19. The spread of cases from Syria prompted the kingdom last Wednesday to impose a week-long closure of the Jaber border crossing, a trade artery for Syrian and Lebanese transit goods to the Gulf and Iraq. Prime minister Omar al Razzaz said on Sunday that tougher measures at the border crossing would be imposed in the next few days given the spike in neighbouring countries and complacency in applying social distancing and health safeguards. “We don’t want, God forbid, to have a second wave,” Razzaz said. In addition to measures, such as increased testing, Razzaz said the authorities will increase the number of caravans to house hundreds of truck drivers and Jordanians arriving from Syria who are put under quarantine. Syria has witnessed an alarming increase in the spread of the coronavirus in the last two weeks, western NGOs and World Health Organization officials say. The Damascus government has admitted there has been a rise in daily cases, with 84 cases announced on Sunday. But medical sources and witnesses say there are many more that are not reported in a war-devastated country where testing is limited in a fragile health service. The German Federal Cartel Office is investigating the allegation that Amazon abused a market-dominating position during the coronavirus pandemic. “We are currently investigating whether and how Amazon influences retailers’ pricing on the marketplace,” cartel office president Andreas Mundt told the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. During the first months of the pandemic, there were complaints that Amazon had blocked retailers because of allegedly excessive prices. “Amazon must not be a price controller. That also applies now,” Mundt said.Mundt described Amazon as an indispensable platform for many retailers. “On the other hand, we have so far not formally established market dominance,” he added.Germany is the second largest market for the US group after the United States.

Follow latest updatesIn the neighbouring Australian state of New South Wales – the country’s most populous – the premier, Gladys Berejiklian has spoken about her anxiety over containing community transmission:While the case numbers have been pleasingly declining, my anxiety remains the same, if not slightly higher, because every week we have had undetected or unsourced cases.Health is working overnight 247 to find the genomic links or find those links between the cases that don’t have a known source and existing clusters.I mean, potentially the virus is continuing to spread in particular parts of south-western and western Sydney and that is a big concern because if you look back to Melbourne, Melbourne didn’t get worse because of the number of cases they had, they had undetected community transmission which then unknowingly got to a stage where it did – it did form a number of different clusters and we certainly don’t want that to happen here in New South Wales.New South Wales has had much smaller numbers of community transmission, with cases under 10 on each of the past four days. Just a quick update from the two other press conferences that have been going on – both in Australia:First to Victoria, where we have learned more details of the 25 Victorians who died in the last 24 hours, on Australia’s deadliest day:Twenty-two of those 25 fatalities are linked to aged care outbreaks.There are 657 Victorians in hospital – 44 of those are receiving intensive care and 32 of those 44 are on a ventilator.Bloomfield praises those New Zealanders who have come forward to be tested:“It’s been very heartening to see the number of people coming forward to get tested,” Bloomfield says.Bloomfield says there are now 78 cases active in NZ, 58 of which are from the Auckland cluster discovered last week. The twenty other cases are in managed isolation quarantine facilities and are imported.Five people are receiving hospital care, all of whom are connected to the cluster.We are about to hear from New Zealand’s director general of health, Ashely Bloomfield, on the growing cluster of cases in Auckland – as of Sunday there were 49 community transmission cases. In case you missed it earlier, the PM, Jacinda Ardern, delayed the country’s election this morning from 19 September to 17 October.Bloomfield says there are 9 new cases in the community. Seven of them have been linked to previous cases in the Auckland cluster. Two are under investigation. He says they are believed to be linked to the cluster.There have been four new Covid-19 deaths in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency. This brings to eight the total number of Palestinian refugees who have died from coronavirus since Lebanon first recorded an outbreak of the virus in February.Over 200,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon, the majority living below the poverty line, according to UN. Their right to work and own property is restricted.The UN agency, which provides health and education services to Palestinians across the region, called for vigilance in observing measures to combat the spread of the virus in the densely populated camps.“If prevention is not adhered to, things may get out of control in the Palestine refugee camps in Lebanon,” the statement said.A UNRWA spokesperson told AFP that particular concern focused on the largest, most-populous camp of Ain al-Hilweh, near the southern city of Sidon.Lebanon has seen a spike in coronavirus-related cases and deaths, including 439 new infections on Sunday alone. That brought the total number of infections to 8,881 cases, including 103 deaths since the start of the outbreak in February.A planned return to lockdown was abandoned in the wake of a massive explosion that ripped through large parts of Beirut on 4 August, forcing thousands of people to seek medical attention at the capital’s already overwhelmed hospitals. We are expecting two press conferences in Australia in about 10 mins (from Victoria and NSW) and also one from New Zealand. I’ll do my best to wrap them all up for you.In India, there are growing fears of an “invisible catastrophe” unfolding in the country’s rural villages. You can read our full feature on the crisis facing rural India from the ’s Amrit Dhillon, below.France’s health ministry on Sunday reported 3,015 new coronavirus infections over the last 24 hours, the second day in a row in which new cases have surpassed the 3,000 mark.However, the daily count was below the 3,310 cases reported on Saturday that marked a post-lockdown high.It’s led authorities in the country’s two biggest cities, Paris and Marseille, to expand zones where wearing a mask is mandatory outdoors, while the government is set to propose masks be worn in shared indoor workspaces.The resurgence also prompted the UK to impose quarantine restrictions on people arriving home from France. They came into force at 4am on Saturday.The number of coronavirus clusters being investigated in France had increased to 263, the ministry said in its a website update.The number of people in hospital was up slightly at 4,860, but the number of intensive care patients was unchanged at 376 after increasing the previous day, the ministry said.France’s cumulative death toll for hospitals and nursing homes had risen by one to 30,410, it said. Australia has recorded its deadliest day so far of the pandemic, with 25 deaths, all in the southern state of Victoria. The state government said there were also 282 new cases of the virus, which appears to show a bending of the infection curve, following the imposition of a strict level-4 lockdown in the state capital, Melbourne. These new figures mean that more than 400 Australian’s have died during the pandemic.There are growing concerns for the mental health of Victorians during this substantial outbreak. Australian Associated Press reports:Melburnians have been in strict lockdown for several weeks, with restrictions also placed on regional Victorian residents.The Australian prime minister’s office has said there will be an additional $31.9m to create 15 mental health clinics across Victoria and further enhance essential support during the Covid-19 pandemic. We are expecting a live update from the Victorian premier later today.Italy is to shut discos and clubs and make it compulsory to wear a mask outdoors in some areas between 6pm and 6am.It’s the first reintroduction of restrictions as cases rise, particularly among young people. Cases have double in three weeks and the median age of those affected is now below 40.The new rules will start on Monday – two days after an Italian holiday when many young Italians go out dancing – and will run until early September. Masks will be required between 6pm-6am in areas close to bars and pubs and where gatherings are more likely.“We cannot nullify the sacrifices made in past months. Our priority must be that of opening schools in September, in full safety,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza said on Facebook.Speranza on Saturday urged young people to be as cautious as possible as “if they infect their parents and their grandparents, they risk creating real damage”.On Sunday, 479 new cases were confirmed in the country, down from 629 on Saturday.Testing on holidaymakers landing in Rome’s airports began on Sunday after the government said on Wednesday that people travelling from Croatia, Greece, Malta and Spain must be screened for the virus.New Zealand’s PM is living up to her mantra of “go hard and go early” to contain the country’s growing community-transmiossion coronavirus outbreak, which now stands at 49. Less than a week after the Auckland cluster was discovered, Jacinda Ardern has postponed the country’s election from 19 September to 17 October. Ardern said the biggest risk to overcome would be ensuring 25,000 election workers were well-protected as they go about their work.She said she had factored in participation of voters, fairness and certainty in her decision. She also said the date would not be moved again. “Covid will be with us for some time to come. Continuously pushing out an election does not lessen the risk of disruption and this is why the Electoral Commission has planned for the possibility of holding an election where the country is at level 2, and with some parts at level 3,” she said.“I have absolutely no intention at all to change from this point.”Parliament will now dissolve on 6 September.As of Sunday, there were 69 active cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, including 49 cases from the community connected to or likely to be connected to the Auckland cluster.Hello and welcome to the ’s live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic, with me, Alison Rourke.In the past half hour New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has postponed the country’s election – due to be held on 19 September – because of the new outbreak of coronavirus in the country. The election will now be held on 17 October. New Zealand had gone more than 100 days without a single case of community transmission of Covid-19, until last week, when four new cases were identified in Auckland. There are now 49 community transmission cases in the country.In other coronavirus developments:"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331538.1597589597!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools have no legal basis to force students to attend religion classes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCampaigners argue that children in State-funded schools  face obstacles exercising their right to opt out of religious instruction. Photograph: iStockSchools have no legal basis to compel students to attend religious instruction classes, according to a report to be published this week.Atheist Ireland has sent a 21-page legal opinion to the Department of Education on the right to opt out of religious instruction under provisions contained in the Constitution.The group has long maintained that children in many State-funded schools are either forced to attend religious instruction or face obstacles in exercising their right to opt out of these classes. The legal opinion by barrister James Kane states that pupils have a right to not attend religious instruction, under article 44.2.4 of the Constitution.Mr Kane’s view is that schools are obliged to use their State funding to facilitate this right which encompasses, at the very least, the right to leave the classroom during religious instruction while remaining supervised. The document states that there is “decent legal argument” that these pupils must be taught another subject.The legal opinion also says that the State-approved religion course for Junior Cycle students was shaped with input from religious bodies who, in turn, designed guidelines for the supplementation of this course with Catholic faith formation and development. “It is impossible in those circumstances to see any justification whatsoever for withholding the right of a student to opt out of such a course,” it states.“Teaching Catholic instruction during the State religion syllabus, without offering a supervised opt out, represents an unlawful, systematic and stark attack on the right to not attend religious instruction in State-funded schools.”Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland said the legal opinion will empower atheist and secular parents to exercise their right for their children to not attend religious instruction classes.“In the past, most Irish schools simply coerced children to attend these classes. Since Atheist Ireland highlighted the right to not attend, many schools have instead put obstacles in the way of not attending,” she said.Ms Donnelly said in many cases Catholic schools say students can sit at the back of the religion class due to resource shortages, while Education and Training Board schools maintain that students must attend religion class if they are teaching about more than one faith.“This legal opinion shows that these excuses have no legal standing. You have the right to not attend religious instruction, whether it is about one religion or many religions, and your school must at a minimum supervise you and ideally give you another subject within their existing resources,” she said.“This is a constitutional right. It is not up to schools or even the Department of Education to decide how you exercise it. Your child does not have to attend classes that you reasonably believe are inconsistent with your atheist or humanist convictions.”Principals in a number of Catholic schools, however, insist they are highly inclusive and seek to integrate students from all faith traditions and none.They point to the Economic and Social Research Institute which has found an “overwhelming majority of parents and students find their schools to be well-managed and welcoming”.The department has also said that under the Constitution and the Education Act of 1998, parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they wish. However, State-run secondary schools are refusing to implement a department directive aimed at protecting the rights of students who opt out of religious instruction by offering them alternative tuition. These schools say they do not have resources to provide alternative tuition.Atheist Ireland said it will continue to assist parents to exercise their constitutional rights in Irish schools as part of its campaign for a secular education system."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

However, it is impossible to gauge when that might be,” a spokesman for the company said.An Post did not have figures for the number of people or the volume of mail affected, but the spokesman added that “given the level of the Irish population in Australia, for example, there is a healthy level of mail between the two countries including so called ‘care parcels’ from Ireland to family members in Australia”.Several other countries, including France, have resumed postal services to the State but with restrictions in place as a result of the “complex global situation” in which transport and logistics networks have been “seriously impacted” by the pandemic.There is currently no parcel service from Ireland to the US, but letters, large envelopes and packets are still being accepted. Sweden is another country where full postal service has not yet been restored. Mail is currently being accepted for France but there are some restrictions relating to the size of items. The French post office has told An Post that there are internal delays on all mail and it has limited the size of items to 32cm by 24cm by 24cm. “Social distancing is in effect and thus they cannot guarantee the delivery of larger items until these measures have been lifted,” An Post said.For mail to and from Italy, the maximum item weight is 25kg, maximum length is 120cm and maximum of all three dimensions is 150cm.Several countries, including Lithuania, Latvia, Belgium and Bulgaria are experiencing “internal delays”, resulting in a longer delivery time, An Post said. However, postal services from various countries were being restored all the time. South Africa, South Korea and Croatia were among a group of about 14 countries to which mail services were recently restored.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331689.1597607693!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jim o callaghan would be honoured to lead fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan has said he would be ‘honoured’ to lead the party and will give it ‘full consideration’ when a vacancy arises.

He would have had to reveal what was in a confidential document in order for him to do what people say he should have done. It was a tough call, but I would have given him more time.”The Dublin Bay South TD also said that while there is no vacancy as of yet, he would in future consider putting himself forward to lead the party.Mr O’Callaghan turned down a junior position in the Department of Justice after Mr Martin elected not to appoint him to a senior role at Cabinet. Despite this, he said he has a “good relationship with Micheál.”“Obviously people look back to the fact that in 2016, when I was elected, I was part of the team that entered into (government formation) negotiations with Fine Gael. Just because I did that, doesn’t mean I had an automatic entitlement to be appointed to the subsequent negotiation team,” he said. He added that it would be “inaccurate to say Micheál and myself don’t have a good relationship”.

Workers at dozens of state-owned factories across the country have either walked out or threatened industrial action unless authorities meet their demands: hold a new, fair election, stop police violence and release thousands of people detained at anti-government demonstrations earlier this week.With state-paid workers turning against him, Mr Lukashenko is losing his main electoral base as well as billions of pounds in revenue that he has used to maintain Belarus’ mighty security apparatus and secret services.  The working-class revolt in Belarus has more than echoes of anti-Communist protests in eastern Europe in 1989 when workers tipped the scales to help bring down the Soviet Union.Belarusian protesters are on the cusp of breaking a decades-old status quo in the region with Belarus serving as essentially the buffer zone between Russia and European democracies.In the medieval town of Hrodna, just nine miles away from Poland where electoral fraud of the scale seen in Belarus would be unimaginable, workers spoke of monthly salaries under £300 and the way that outright lies on state TV, which portrays Belarus as a workers’ idyll, clash with the reality of declining living standards near the EU border.At a quarry, several dozen men in tracksuit trousers and overalls stood by the side of the road, smoking cigarettes and waving white balloons at the passing cars.“We’ve been cheated for such a long time, and now enough is enough,” said Mr Vydra, the handyman, who conceded that he and his friends did not care about elections in the past until they saw last Sunday’s vote-rigging and the ensuing crackdown.This week\u0027s unrest began when protesters against Sunday\u0027s election result were met with a staggeringly vicious police response.Riot police and special forces in full gear would throw stun grenades at unarmed people and fire rubber bullets into crowds, killing three. Belarusians with blood streaming down their faces fled the scene.Days later, protesters were released from detention, with bruises covering their bodies like full-body tattoos in a chilling testament of beatings and torture at the hands of law enforcement.Nearly 7,000 people across the country have been detained, and hundreds have been injured and beaten up while in custody. A 16-year-old man detained at a Minsk protest was taken to hospital from jail on Saturday after he fell into a coma from beatings.The scenes of police violence have stunned the nation of nine million people, drawing comparisons to the country’s history as a major battlefield in the Second World War.Hrodna, a quiet town of 370,000 people, with baroque cathedrals, was plunged into urban warfare for several nights in a row as riot police in full gear chased away anti-Lukashenko demonstrators.Less than a mile away from Hrodna’s picturesque bridge overlooking two medieval fortresses, middle-aged men came out of the Neman cigarette factory to discuss an upcoming walkout during their lunch break. Standing in the air smelling of tobacco, the several dozen men spoke about a car accident provoked by riot police that shook residents to the core.On Tuesday night, riot police officers threw themselves onto a car of a local family and started thrashing it with truncheons as punishment for honking in support of the protests. An armoured vehicle rammed into the car from the back, injuring a five-year-old girl who was in the back seat, local media reported.“What we saw on our streets was open warfare. How can you forget it and move on?” said Rashid Latykov, who came out of the factory building to buy a pack of Minsk cigarettes from a nearby kiosk. “Our country has been seized by a gang.”Earlier that afternoon the cigarette factory workers held a union meeting. It started with a call to stand up to show if they voted for opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled the country after reported threats. The entire room of people in Neman’s blue uniforms got up and clapped.But nothing, perhaps, cuts deeper for Mr Lukashenko than unrest at the iconic Minsk Tractor Works, which accounts for 10 per cent of global tractor production.There is a saying in Belarus that outsiders know the country for two things: potatoes and tractors. Asked about the dangers of coronavirus earlier this year, the president said: Tractors will heal everything.Workers from the plant marched across the city centre on Friday after the prime minister refused to speak to them publicly during a visit.On Thursday, several-hundred angry workers confronted the local mayor outside the gate of the BelAz heavy machinery plant in a Minsk suburb.The country’s eight largest enterprises that have staged walkouts this week brought in a combined £9.5 billion in revenues last year, according to the Russian news website The Bell.Once scared of losing their jobs, workers in Hrodna say they have passed the point of no return.“That violence has changed anything - I can’t stay silent,” Larisa Rybak, a petite woman in blue-and-black overalls of the Hrodna Azot fertiliser plant, told The  as she walked out of the plant’s gate at the end of her shift to join a march into the city centre.At 54, Mrs Rybak, who makes about £400 a month, is nearing state pension age in an economy with dim prospects, but she feels compelled to be part of the movement on the cusp of toppling President Lukashenko. “We have finally woken up, and we won’t leave till he goes.”As the clock struck 5.30pm, she and several-hundred men and women in Hrodna Azot overalls set off from the factory to join a 30,000-strong rally in the centre, chanting “Long live Belarus!” and flashing  peace signs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives determined drive natural supporters revolt","story":"The barricades are going up, but it’s those who oppose them who are restive. Under a scheme backed by millions of pounds of government grants, councils have been given permission to close off streets, narrow roads, widen pavements, and impose cycle lanes, all without the need to consult residents. The aim was to relieve pressure on public transport, which at the time the Government was desperate to dissuade people from using.Now, amid the general wreckage of lockdown, not only are we left with bankrupt rail, bus and tube services - still largely empty, propped up with billions of taxpayer subsidy - but state-mandated road congestion, and crazy schemes that are inciting a slow-burning revolt across the country.In Islington, the council plans to turn a third of its roads into “people-friendly streets” by the end of the year. Residents have staged multiple demonstrations complaining of the increased congestion and pollution they say has resulted from road closures. In Welwyn, the constituency of Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, locals were furious that road-narrowing and new one-way systems put visitors off coming to the high street, turning the place into a ghost-town.“Vigilantes” had taken to dismantling overnight the grim plastic barriers that now seem to line half the streets in the country. Hundreds have signed petitions against road closures in Cambridgeshire, local Tories have joined the resistance in Lambeth, and seemingly everywhere there is frustration, even fury, against local authorities that have failed to foresee the consequences of their arrogant and poorly thought-through measures.It should have been obvious that the pandemic would result in an increase in the use of cars relative to other forms of transport, although cycling has become more popular too. I can’t be alone in having used the opportunity of lockdown to buy a new car: when spontaneity is crushed by the diktats of social-distancing, driving offers the freedom to go anywhere you like without having to mask up or lather yourself with hand sanitiser.Yet on my road, the council has decided to erect a “bus gate” - not a gate, but a camera to ensure only buses go through - forcing all traffic onto a gridlocked major road. In the London suburbs, where my parents live, anti-car measures are being foisted on places where cycling is impractical because the distances are too great.It is tempting to blame councils for this fiasco. They are the originators of inappropriate 20mph zones, excessive bus lanes, sign clutter, and many of the other absurdities that have conspired to make UK roads among the most congested and confusing in Europe. But this is a mess of the Government’s making. Mr Shapps determined that Covid was an emergency that necessitated significant changes in road layouts, implicitly endorsing the ideology of anti-car fanatics. Yet most people need their cars to get around: indeed, drivers are natural Conservative supporters.

The numbers of coronavirus patients in French hospitals and in intensive care remain relatively low. But the government fears the epidemic may spiral out of control as the French return to the cities from summer holidays across the country.Up to a third of clusters of new cases have been linked to private-sector workplaces.Elisabeth Borne, the employment minister, is to discuss the proposal with employers and union leaders on Tuesday.She said scientists unanimously recommended wearing masks “when several people are in a confined space.” They will only be compulsory in inidual offices when more than one person is present.The government is also considering strengthening other workplace precautions such as plastic iders for open-plan offices. “Taking into account what we have observed in workplace clusters, additional precautions are sometimes worth taking,” Ms Borne said.She said employers who place seasonal workers such as hotel staff or fruit pickers in shared accommodation may be asked to do more to ensure that social distancing is maintained and masks are worn.Face-masks are already compulsory in indoor public spaces, but doctors and the government’s scientific advisors have lobbied for the rule to be extended to private companies. Many French cities have made them mandatory in crowded areas.Despite the rise in new cases, the latest figures show only 29 new admissions to hospital and nine more intensive care patients. France now has 4,857 Covid-19 cases in hospitals, including 376 in intensive care.Many of the new cases are younger people under 45 who tend not to have symptoms.French government messages urging people to follow the rules in order to avert the need for a second lockdown may have backfired. According to public health experts, the warnings may have unintentionally encouraged the young to view the summer as a window of opportunity for fun before another lockdown.The young have been blamed for fuelling France’s alarming spike in new infections by holding beach parties and packing into bars without maintaining social distancing or wearing face-masks.“The strategy of fear doesn’t work,” said François Alla, professor of public health at the main Bordeaux teaching hospital.Many people feel they did their bit to check the spread of the virus during lockdown and are now entitled to socialise.“It’s like stuffing yourself with a dessert crammed with calories after an ultra-low calorie fish main course,” said Angela Sutan, professor of behavioural and experimental economics at the Burgundy School of Business in Dijon.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national effort can reverse educational fiasco","story":"For millions of children, lockdown has been nothing short of a disaster. According to a UCL report, 2.3 million children have been learning for less than one hour per day. The NFER found that 40 per cent of pupils have not been in regular contact with their teachers.The exams controversy and Ofqual’s Kafkaesqe ‘algorithm’ are merely symptoms of a more general malaise in getting children back to school. Perhaps, with greater determination, exams could have been postponed rather than denied and this unfathomable grades system would not have been necessary.Given the epidemic of educational poverty and the additional risks to children remaining at home - from mental health to safeguarding concerns - you would expect the health and science establishment to be making every effort to ensure pupils are learning again from September. Instead, everything seems to be focused on the minimal risk to children and the possible risk to older pupils. This is despite schools opening in many countries around the world, with little effect on transmission.Alongside the ‘computer says no’ attitude, sections of the unions have posed hundreds of questions about returning to school, alongside an ever-growing list of conditions. Questions and conditions that if applied to other workplaces would probably have seen supermarkets shut during the lockdown. Questions and conditions that do not explain why children can go shopping in Primark or eat at McDonalds, but not attend school.With the exception of a few courageous iniduals like Professor Russell Viner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics, the Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield and some children’s charities, not enough people have been campaigning to get children back to school. Few seem to have appreciated the dangers to pupils stuck at home and the potentially irreversible long term damage.  The attitude from quangos and unions seems to be that everything is impossible, rather than, as the great Sir Nicholas Winton of Kindertransport fame once said: “If it is not impossible there must be a way to do it”. It is heartening that many schools, teachers and support staff are ignoring the naysayers and continuing their preparations for a return in the September term.But in order to defeat the defeatists, all the major education players need a serious plan for the weeks and months ahead. First, the DfE urgently needs a stronger grip on the impact of the lockdown on children who did not attend school, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. As the Schools Minister confirmed to the Education Select Committee, it has done no modelling to understand this.Second, Government guidance to schools should be clear, timely and properly communicated. The NHS - understandably - had an action plan for Covid-19. The same is needed for education, including a detailed timetable and safeguarding support. There must be clear expectations as to the nature, quality and quantity of school learning and home education in the event of local lockdowns. Where a high number of teachers are not in work due to sickness, self-isolation or shielding, schools should be supported through a fully-funded national scheme to ensure pupils can continue learning.Third, Covid-19 exposed a huge digital ide. The Children’s Commissioner suggested that 700,000 children do not have access to a computer or tablet. Schools could be given vouchers to spend on devices at their local Curry’s, rather than relying on a national procurement scheme.There are vital lessons for other agencies. So, fourth, rather than the badger-like approach Ofsted has taken thus far, adopting a period of semi-hibernation during lockdown (excepting their work with local authorities), the inspectorate must be proactive in overseeing school efforts. While many Ofsted staff were deployed to local councils, hundreds lay semi-dormant. What a waste.By the time they go back to school, most children will not have set foot in a classroom for six months. This will harm disadvantaged youngsters most. Before the pandemic struck, there was already an 18-month attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils at GCSE-level and their peers.

Data published from the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation revealed that 39.1 per cent of grades in England were lowered from teachers’ predictions.However, pupils identified as being of “lower socio-economic status” were statistically more likely to have their grades downgraded.In an unprecedented move, four UK Children\u0027s Commissioners even published a joint letter on Sunday, urging all universities to honor all offers made to domestic students. The Commissioners argued that the A Level marking system had resulted in too many anomalies and a sense of hopelessness and frustration among  impacted students. In recent days, a campaign called #HonourTheOffer has gone viral on  Twitter, with Oxbridge graduates urging their colleges to let those with bumped-down grades in.Meanwhile, hundreds of former students have added their name to a public letter calling for all 2020 offers to be made unconditional across colleges.The letter, which will be sent to every Oxford admissions office, was organised by Hannah O\u0027Rourke and Liam Whitton who both studied at Oxford 12 years ago, having attended struggling comprehensive schools.In a statement published on August 15, the university said that it had the “greatest admiration and sympathy” for A Level students and said over half of students who missed their offers had been admitted.However, students who have to appeal their results may lose their place this year, with the university warning “once we reach our maximum intake of undergraduates in 2020, we will have to defer entry to 2021 for any additional candidates who appeal successfully and whose place is then confirmed.”Following growing criticism at the University’s policy, some inidual colleges have taken a different stance.On Thursday, Worcester College became the first Oxbridge college to allow all offer holders to take up their place in September regardless of whether or not they made their offer.In a statement published on the college website, Worcester said: “We made offers in 2020 to our most erse cohort ever, and in response to the uncertainties surrounding this year’s assessment, we have confirmed the places of all our UK offer-holders, irrespective of their A-level results.”Wadham College has since followed suit, announcing on Sunday that it had decided to prioritize assessments made by tutors rather than A Level results and would be admitting “all 2020 offer holders”.While Somerville College said that it has filled all of its places for this year, it has promised to honour the offers for all remaining students for the next academic year.The college said: “Somerville has confirmed a record number of offers this year and is now at maximum capacity.” “To those students whose conditions to take up their offers have still not been met, we would like to say that we will honour your offers for the year 2021-2022 should you want to appeal your results. If you do make an appeal and are successful, we will find meaningful support for you during your unexpected gap year, whether that is through an internship, academic mentoring or some other project.”St Edmund’s Hall has also said that it will honour all offers, stating: the college has taken the decision to make offers unconditional for all applicants whose places were not originally confirmed, and welcome them to the Hall.A spokesperson from the University of Oxford said: Oxford University has been looked carefully at the inidual circumstances of all applicants who didn’t meet their grades this year. We have now offered places to over 300 of them, far more than in previous years. The overwhelming majority of these are UK state school candidates, from disadvantaged backgrounds.As a result our UK state school intake this year currently stands at 67.8 per cent - an increase of 5.7 per cent compared to 2019. It is not possible to give place to all state school offer holders as we are constrained by government Student Number Controls. We also do not have space to admit any more students while meeting social distancing restrictions and other health and safety challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.However, a Department for Education spokesperson has said: As we have already assured universities, any student who successfully appeals their grades will not count against their student number controls, whether or not the university confirms their place before the appeal concludes.We have asked universities to hold places for those whose grades are being appealed.The student number controls are a vital part of stabilising the admissions system and ensuring a fair and structured spread of students across higher education providers.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south africa announces easing lockdown alcohol cigarette sales","story":"South Africa will lift its coronavirus-linked ban on the sale of alcohol and tobacco products on Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said, announcing the removal of nearly all restrictions on economic activities.The virus-related ban on the purchase of booze and cigarettes has been controversial, and no other country has introduced both measures together.It came into effect when South Africa went into a strict nationwide lockdown on March 27 to stem the spread of coronavirus.Alcohol sales were prohibited to ease pressure on hospitals, allowing doctors in emergency wards to focus on Covid-19 rather than road accidents and other booze-related injuries.Tobacco products were restricted because of the health impacts of smoking as well as the risk of contamination between people sharing cigarettes.While tobacco sales have been forbidden since the start of lockdown, alcohol purchases were tentatively re-authorised in June and banned again when cases spiked the following month.Restrictions on the sale of tobacco will be lifted, the suspension of the sale of alcohol will be lifted subject to certain restrictions, Ramaphosa said as he addressed the nation, adding that significant progress had been made against the disease.The president also announced the sweeping removal of nearly all restrictions on economic activity and the resumption of inter-provincial leisure travel.Bars will be allowed to re-open, and both family gatherings and social visits will be authorised. A 10:00 pm curfew remains in place however, and the wearing of face coverings is still compulsory in public spaces. International borders are to stay closed for the time being and gatherings are still capped at 50 people.The further easing of restrictions presents us with the greatest opportunity... to breathe life into our struggling economy, the president said.But South Africa\u0027s main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party said the economy had already been killed.These restrictions should have been lifted months ago, DA leader John Steenhuisen said in a statement, calling for urgent economic reforms and for international tourists to be allowed back.We are now in the midst of a devastating economic depression, and all that matters now is getting as many South Africans working as we possibly can.South Africa still has the fifth-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, with 583,653 infections registered to date. At least 11,677 are known to have died from the disease.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/16/14/aoc-alexandra-ocasio-cortez-cardi-b-0.jpg","title":"cardi b aoc president twitter wap alexandra ocasio cortez","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Congresswoman\u0027s choice of potential slogan references Cardi B\u0027s new songCardi B has called for Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez to run for president at the next US election.The rapper endorsed the congresswoman on Twitter, who replied with a potential slogan referencing her new song with Megan Thee Stallion.In response to a video in which Ocasio-Cortez used Cardi B’s song “Bodak Yellow” while delivering a message about healthcare, Cardi B wrote: “She better run for president when she turns 35,”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOcasio-Cortez will turn 35 in October 2024, meaning she will then be able to run for president.

Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBack in 2018, the artist, who is known for hits including “Jolene” and “9 to 5”, renamed the Civil War-themed attraction from “Dixie Stampede” to “Dolly Parton’s Stampede”.Parton, who was born in Tennessee, is known for having an especially strong following in the southern US states, where support for the Black Lives Matter movement is often lower. People on social media were quick to praise Parton for speaking out.“Between Dolly Parton’s quiet Covid research fund, BLM support, and her sending generations of children books through the USPS, at 74, she continues to be one of the most relevant and ever timely people of every era,” wrote one Twitter user.Parton was also described as a “national treasure,” and an “American treasure”, while someone else described Parton as “one incredible American”.Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote: “Me: I couldn’t love @DollyParton more.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ve also been thinking a lot about the people in lockdown, particularly women facing domestic violence, and I’m proud to be able to be a voice for those who don’t have one.”Prior to the swim, Ms McCardel said she hopes her latest feat can help to raise awareness about domestic violence, revealing this week that she is a survivor who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.There was initial concern as to whether Ms McCardel and her team would need to quarantine on their return to the UK, with the Department of Transport warning that the Australian should seek legal advice over the issue.However, she said she had been given the all-clear by English and French coastguards and was now hoping to celebrate once she was back on British soil.“I would like to have a little celebration this evening in England,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions? the A-Level student said she had failed to meet her offer from the Royal Veterinary College, adding: “I have now idea how this has happened.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Under New Zealand law, Ms Ardern had the option of delaying the election for up to about two months.Opposition parties had been requesting a delay after a virus outbreak in Auckland last week prompted the government to put the city into a two-week lockdown and halted election campaigning.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBefore the latest outbreak, New Zealand had gone 102 days without any known community transmission of the virus, and life had returned to normal for most people, who were going to restaurants, sports stadiums and schools without fear of getting infected. The only known cases during that time were returning travellers who were quarantined at the border.Officials believe the virus was reintroduced to New Zealand from abroad but haven\u0027t yet been able to figure out how it happened. The Auckland outbreak has grown to 49 infections, with authorities saying they believe the cases are all connected, giving them hope the virus isn\u0027t spreading beyond the cluster.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lightning forks over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as a storm passes over OaklandBelarus opposition supporters gather near the Pushkinskaya metro station where Alexander Taraikovsky, a 34-year-old protester died on August 10, during their protest rally in central MinskAlphaTauri\u0027s driver Daniil Kvyat takes part in the second practice session at the Circuit de Catalunya in Montmelo near Barcelona ahead of the Spanish F1 Grand PrixSoldiers of the Brazilian Armed Forces during a disinfection of the Christ The Redeemer statue at the Corcovado mountain prior to the opening of the touristic attraction in RioYoung elephant bulls tussle playfully on World Elephant Day at the Amboseli National Park in KenyaFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex is helped by a member of staff to put a protective suit on prior to his visit at the CHU hospital in MontpellierLocals harvest their potatoes as Mount Sinabung spews volcanic ash in Karo, North Sumatra province, IndonesiaDoves fly over the Peace Statue at Nagasaki Peace Park during the memorial ceremony held for the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombingAnti-government protesters try to remove concrete wall that installed by security forces to prevent protesters reaching the Parliament square, during a protest against the political elites and the government after this week\u0027s deadly explosion in BeirutA protester throws a stone towards Israeli forces in the village of Turmus Aya, north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, following a march by Palestinians against the building of Israeli settlementsA woman yells as soldiers block a road for French President Emmanuel Macron\u0027s visit the Gemmayzeh neighborhood.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it came from Japan ”“If you don’t stay two metres apart, you would definitely get coronavirus,” Blossom Lee Watkins, seven, of South Shields, South Tyneside, added.“You can’t touch people, that’s why people get coronavirus,” Lucas Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, explained.Four-year-old Tim Ogah, from Newcastle, disagreed. He said: “I didn’t really miss my friends at school because I was far too busy in lockdown.”He added: “You can’t stop coronavirus because it’s too strong. We all need to be really, really careful as it takes over your bodyyou don’t wear a mask.”What about the Prime Minister, the man tasked with guiding us through the pandemic Blossom Lee said: “I don’t like Boris Johnson because he opened up pubs before he opened up parks!”“I don’t like him either because he’s too strict,” Clover replied.Blossom Lee then added: “He said that no one was allowed to have haircuts and then he had a haircut! I think Donald Trump’s hair is worse than Boris Johnson’s, I think Boris’s is great.”Evie Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, cut in: “Everybody in my family has been shaving their hair off because they needed a haircut. My dad now looks like my uncle because my uncle has no hair.”The group agreed that, unlike many adults, none of them would shave their hair offthey couldn’t get to the hairdressers.The children then moved on to discuss the PM’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings.“Why did he go all the way to a castle to test his eyes ” Blossom Lee asked the group.“We just went on loads of walks in lockdown! We didn’t go very far,” Evie replied. “I really enjoyed lockdown because of all the days off nursery.”Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, was also brought up. Blossom Lee: “Matt is probably a friend of Boris because he has the same clothes as him.”“I would definitely be friends with him, becausehe’s friends with Boris then I could probably go and meet Boris and talk to him,” said Clover.“I would tell Boris to open everything up and be less strict.”Next, the children were shown a photo of national treasure Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised £million for the NHS by doing laps of his garden.They instantly recognised him. Lucas said: “I don’t think Captain Tom would be able to play football with me. Well, maybehe had his walking stick.”Clover added: “When Captain Tom was knighted he definitely got a sword and armour.“He must have special armour attached to his walking stick. Maybe he uses his sword as a walking stick ”Blossom Lee said: “Maybe he’s got a magic power, where he shoots things from his walking stick ”Evie cut in: “If I raised £million, I would buy a flying unicorn.”The group were then shown a photo of Prof Whitty.Clover jumped in straight away to say: “I have seen him on an advert on TV. He says ‘stay at home’ and ‘don’t go and meet people’.”Blossom Lee wasn’t sure who he was but said: “I don’t think I would be friends with him because his eyebrows are scary.”Evie added: “If he had brown eyebrows then people would think he was nicer.”Clover said: “We need to glue some hair on him, because he hasn’t got much.”Later, the children were shown a photo of fitness coach Joe Wicks.Clover said: “He’s the person who goes on TV and does workouts and stuff. I would just get tired after doing his exercises though, I had to have a big glass of water afterwards.”The children agreed that Joe’s workouts were far too early in the morning.Most of the children missed going to school.Clover said: “I like school, and I missed not going because my favourite subject is art because I love drawing.”Blossom Lee said: “I think this will all be over in two weeks, I can go back to ballet then.”She added: “You should be washing your hands twice a day, once in a morning and once at night.”She added: “I really don’t like wearing a mask because it steams up my glasses.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a pretty young woman, lots of red hair, and everyone expects me to be stupid when I walk into a meeting for the first time.“I’m not stupid and most people know that now, but I still like to be underestimated because it gives me an edge. It gives me a bit of stealth.”Since September , Ms Rayner has declared £, worth of cash donations and support from unions including GMB, RMT, Unite, CWU, Usdaw and Unison, some of whom supported her successful deputy leadership campaign.Tory MP Tim Loughton, a former education minister, said: “The cat’s out of the bag about Labour’s deputy leader. She sees no evil, hears no evil and speaks no eveil when it comes to unions messing up.“It is no wonder the unions are happy to continue funding the Labour party when as far as they are concerned they can do no wrong. Welcome back to the s.”A source close to Ms Rayner said: “This is a desperate and embarrassing attempt by the Tories to distract from their disastrous handling of the coronavirus, the economy and exam results.“Angela is immensely proud of her long record of standing up for undervalued and underpaid keyworkers against bad bosses and a Tory government that doesn’t care about them.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are thought to have been targeting the holidaymaker’s watch, although at one point the victim appeared to be trying to keep hold of the keys to his Bentley convertible.The incident outside the unnamed hotel, in the palm tree-lined Paseo Colon in Barcelona’s Ciutat Vella district, occurred two months after thugs were filmed brutally beating a foreign man living in the city before making off with his watch.Police confirmed after that incident five Moroccan men had been arrested.Footage from the latest incident showed the wealthy Brazilian targeted by muggers leaving his hotel with two other people including a well-dressed woman.One of the robbers surprised him from behind as three other accomplices who had come from dferent directions pounced on him like vultures.The male pal the robbery victim had walked out of the hotel with ran round to the driver’s door of the parked Bentley to help his friend ward off his attackers.The tourist trio managed to make it back to their hotel as the muggers fled.Staff at the hotel revealed afterwards the tourists, who said they recognised the attackers and believed they had been monitoring their movements the previous day, had left Barcelona for Monte Carlo after the scare. One told Barcelona daily La Vanguardia: “They only spent a night here and after what happened they changed their plans and left for Monte Carlo.“And a few hours later, as other guests realised what had happened, the rest of our clients also decided to leave.“We made great efforts to reopen this summer, only for the few tourists in the city to flee frightened because of the criminals here.”Love Island star Laura Anderson revealed last month how she became the victim of an alleged mugging in Barcelona and felt too scared to leave her hotel room.The Catalan capital has come under the spotlight in recent months over the amount of violent crime, with local police union CCOO claiming earlier this week the public’s security could not be guaranteed with the number of officers available.A spokesman for the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force confirmed today: “No arrests have yet taken place but the suspects in this attempted robbery have been identied.”A well-placed source said they had yet to receive a formal complaint from the victims.The Mossos spokesman also said an operation to tackle repeat offenders blamed for the vast majority of the muggings and other violent crimes occurring in Barcelona, had led to a reduction in the number of incidents.The force said: “During the months of June and July we have arrested  people for violent robberies,  of whom have been remanded in prison.“Of the hundred or so repeat offenders estimated to be operating in Barcelona at the moment,  have been arrested since June .”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I could see China was covering up the truth and I had to do something since I was a professional who could explain it.Dr Yan spent seven years in Changsha completing a medical degree before completing a PhD at Southern Medical University in ophthalmology – the treatment of eye disorders.While at the University of Hong Kong she studied influenza, vaccines and coronaviruses.Prof Leo Poon, the head of the public health laboratory sciences ision asked her to investigate the virus in Wuhan for the Hong Kong government, the Mail adds.Dr Yan alleges that she was asked to conduct a secret investigation.This request coincided with the day that Taiwanese experts alerted the WHO about a new respiratory disease emerging in Wuhan.Based on my evidence and experience, I knew there was human transmission and more cases than the government was admitting, says Dr Yan.She claims that health bosses had the genome sequence of the new bug, yet were advising people not to worry.But Dr Yan said she believed the disease may have been created on purpose, following reckless tests on bat coronaviruses in military labs.However CGTN, Chinas state-owned TV channel described “her claim that she is a defector is amusing”.Tom Fowdy, an academic interested in East Asias politics and affairs - who writes opinion pieces for the channel - claimed there were “credibility issues with her story.“If she has conducted this so-called research on the Covid-, which the university denies, then where is it ” he asked.Dr Yan has said she feared she would be killed for speaking out in China and chose to escape to the US, where she is currently hiding at an undisclosed location.The virologist told Fox News: “The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid.If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it I will be disappeared and killed.According to Dr Yan, the Chinese Communist Party and senior university staff suppressed evidence that coronavirus could be transmitted between humans as early as last December. Dr Yan, who grew up in mainland China, said she was among the first scientists asked to investigate a small number of cases in Wuhan.She claimed her supervisor first asked her to conduct a secret investigation into a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December  of last year.Dr Yan said: “The China government refused to get overseas experts, even including ones in Hong Kong, to do research in China.”So I turned to my friends to get more information.The researcher said she then spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinas Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.She said the pal told her of an unknown virus that had emerged in Wuhan and that family cluster cases, an indicator of human-to-human transmission, had been observed.She was also told that the number of cases was thought to be rising exponentially.Dr Yan claimed that, when she took her findings to her superior, she was warned to keep silent and be careful.He warned me... Dont touch the red line, Dr Yan said, referring to the unspoken limits placed by Beijing on such investigations.We will get in trouble and well be disappeared. The scientist says it was information that she believed could have saved lives.Dr Yan claimed the Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including those from Hong Kong, conduct research in China.She explained: “I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of Covid- and the origin of the SARS- Covid virus.”Doctors have reported being detained after speaking out on social media about what they were witnessing, while journalists have recounted being harassed and having their equipment confiscated after trying to report on the issue.Ill-fated whistle blower Dr Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the killer virus but was sent a chilling letter by the police before he died.He was told by copshe refused to repent he would be punished not long before he was killed by the deadly virus.Dr Yan said: “I know how they treat whistleblowers.”[They want] To keep people silentthey want to reveal the truth, not only about COVID-, but also for the other things happening in China.”I am waiting to tell all the things I know, provide all the evidence to the US Government.”She went on: “And I want them to understand, and I also want the US people to understand how terrible this is. It is not what you have seen. This is something very dferent.“We have to chase the true evidence and get the real evidence because this is a key part to stop this pandemic. We dont have much time.A bombshell spy dossier claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.A -page document, obtained by Australias The Saturday , laid the foundation for a case being created against China for its handling of the deadly disease.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Chinas secrecy surrounding the virus led to an assault on international transparency.It said: Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January .”The World Health Organisation does the same.

But Andy Burnham believes some restrictions will soon be lted.He told the Mirror: Hopefully, we will begin to see some people getting released.If things stay as they are I think it is likely that we would see a change.But he warned that the numbers can change quite dramatically in four, five days and some areas could face restrictions for some time. Measures will remain in place, and possibly tighten, in the worst hit areas but will be relaxed where cases have fallen, he added.The latest figures for Greater Manchester showed Oldham had . cases per , people while Rochdale had ..Manchester had ., Salford ., and Tameside . - all far higher than the UK-wide average of ..

People feel frustration, anger and fatigue.The Labour politician also said people in lower-paid jobs, who are unable to work from home, are more vulnerable after virus outbreaks in several northern warehouses.He questioned why poorer communities were being hit harder and called on the Government to reimburse firms whose workers have to self-isolate. Most of those people were working through lockdown, he said.People on the lowest pay are simply not able to self-isolate because they wont get any paythey do.Why are these communities struggling to bring levels of the virus down  It is linked to the nature of peoples work and the housing that we have.

Mr Shapps told BBC Radio ’s Today programme last week: “With France and these other countries, the Netherlands and where, the numbers have now just got above the threshold - which is about  cases per , measured on a -day rolling average. “That’s what the Joint Biosecurity Centre will be looking at.” Forcing British tourists to self-isolate for two weeks after ing from Greece would be a fresh blow to Britainaposs hard-hit international travel industry after Spain, France and Portugal were put on the quarantine list. Greece, where  people have died during the pandemic, was seen as safe for tourists. But cases surged after it reopened its borders to Britons in mid-July. Some  new cases were reported by the EUaposs coronavirus authorities today, with more than , in the last five days.Gkikas Magiorkinis of Athens University said earlier this week: We can say that Greece has formally entered a second wave of the epidemic. This is the point that we could win or lose the battle. Travel expert Alex Macheras told the Mail on Sunday: “Early in the pandemic Greece imposed a hard lockdown and controlled the spread of the virus. “But this has been relaxed to the point of being totally random. “As a result, the number of cases has soared. It is an example of a country wrestling with the competing interests of public health and the economy. “Anyone travelling abroad must do it with their eyes open that there is a danger that quarantine can be imposed at any moment.” Britons desperate to escape for a sunshine getaway are running out of traditional hotspots unless they want to self-isolate for two weeks when theyto the UK.

Around . million people in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were hit with a fresh clampdown more than two weeks ago as officials tried to contain Covid spikes. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham believes rules banning people from mixing with other households – apart from support bubbles – in homes or gardens will be relaxed. He said: “Hopefully, we will begin to see some people getting released. “If things stay as they are I think it is likely that we would see a change.” He said that while curbs would remain and possibly tighten in the worst-hit areas, they would be eased in parts where cases have dropped. Infection rates for Gtr Manchester, published on Saturday, showed Oldham had . cases per , people, Rochdale ., Manchester ., Salford . and Tameside .. The UK-wide average case rate is . per ,. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, Mr Burnham said: “Our cases are flattening – with one exception, Oldham – and we are starting to turn the tide in most of our boroughs. The hope is, maybe we will have a better time ahead of us.”Weekly reviews of curbs are held and he believes this week’s could trigger an easing. He said: “I think the blanket approach will start to be undone – certain boroughs where the cases are lower will startto be released.” Wigan has “far fewer cases” and could be first to have rules lted.Mr Burnham added thatcases have stabilised “the case for releasing boroughs with fewer cases is pretty much made”. Askedthe change could come this week, he said: “Possibly. The numbers can change quite dramatically in four, five days.” He warned that other parts of the region could be stuck with restrictions for some time. Mr Burnham said: “It’s a really tough time for everybody. It’s probably not going to get any easier any time soon. We have had high numbers of cases. It’s not just isolated hotspots.” He feared a full lockdown could be reimposed on areas whether the infection rate is highest, adding: “I think that would be profoundly damaging. “They have got to consider alternatives to it, putting more resources into communities that have the highest rates. It’s a last resort and we need a more sophisticated approach.”  The affected areas were also denied the latest lockdown relaxations that were announced last week for the rest of England, including having up to  guests at wedding receptions, the restart of close-contact services such as eyebrow waxing, and the reopening of bowling alleys, ice rinks and casinos. When the Mirror visited Halax, West Yorkshire, last week, people blamed the Government’s mixed messages for a breakdown in social distancing. One shopper said: “We’re all confused. You can’t go in your daughter’s house but you can go to the pub with her. I’m just not believing everything they are telling us any more.” Mr Burnham said he fears the long-term side effects of banning families from meeting indoors “are getting bigger and the damage is getting greater”. He added: “I hear the desperation in people’s voices when they are talking about parents in care homes, not having seen them. “It’s doing damage to family le. People feel frustration, anger and fatigue.” Mr Burnham said employees in lower-paid jobs, who are unable to work from home, are more vulnerable. Recent outbreaks have flared in food warehouses and a postal sorting office where manual workers are often close to each other. He said: “Why are poorer communities being hit harder  “Most of those people were working through lockdown. People on the lowest pay are simply not able to self-isolate because they won’t get any paythey do. “Why are these communities struggling to bring levels of the virus down  “It is linked to the nature of people’s work and the housing that we have. The Government is standing back now, saying lockdown seems to be its only offer when actually these communities need dferent types of help.” "},{"url":null,"title":"evictions restart across england next","story":"NewsEvictions restart across England next week as MPs fear wave of homelessnessEXCLUSIVE:  MPs have urged more action to protect people at risk of homelessness - as the five-month ban on evictions during coronavirus ends in a weeks timeShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG News MPs have urged more action to protect people at risk of homelessness \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Twenty-one MPs have written to rough sleeping minister Luke Hall to demand more help for the homeless when the change comes in from August . The Lib Dem and Labour MPs, plus the DUP’s Jim Shannon, demand the government guarantees funding for “at least a year” to any council that needs support to keep rough sleepers sheltered. They also repeat Crisis’ call for an urgent law to give any homeless person the right to emergency accommodation in the next  months, and suspend restrictions on migrants accessing Universal Credit. And the MPs call for the government to scrap the Vagrancy Act - a -year-old law that makes it illegal to beg or gather alms in a public place. Lib Dem leadership candidate Layla Moran, who organised the letter, said: “Ministers were right to listen and take urgent action to end rough sleeping during the pandemic, but this cannot be a temporary measure. “The Government must do more. It isnapost good enough to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and then allow the rough sleeping pandemic to .” Landlords were banned by the government from bringing eviction proceedings against their tenants for five months due to the coronavirus pandemic. That ban ends next Sunday and evictions can restart from Monday  August. Landlords will have to submit a ‘reactivation notice’ in which they set out information about the tenants’ circumstances, including whether Covid- has hit their rent.

They issued a letter kick-starting a High Court fight to exams regulator Ofqual today, after thousands of students were left devastated by Thursdayaposs results. The six students represented by the Good Law Project include Michael, the son of a security guard and carer whose BBB predicted grades plunged to EEE due to a standardisation process. Michael, whose school said it is not in a position to appeal, said: It is abysmal to think that the government, whose job it is to lead this country in the right direction, has allowed an algorithm to determine the futures of thousands of students. This injustice cannot and should not stand. They also include Chloe, whose degree apprenticeship is at risk after her predicted ABB grades sank to BCD. She said: Even before I had opened my envelope I started crying. With this legal challenge, I aim to have a voice. What do you think of how grades have been decided  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror.  The six crowdfunded students come hot on the heels of a separate legal challenge to Ofqual by student Curtis Parfitt-Ford, which was formally launched on Friday. Both legal claims have issued a pre-action letter to Ofqual claiming the marking system was unlawful, and both claims seek an urgent judicial review. Exams were abandoned due to coronavirus, so this yearaposs A-level grades were based on teacher predictions. But % of those teacher predictions were downgraded by a controversial algorithm, including .% by two grades and .% by three grades. Meanwhile private schools enjoyed a .% rise in the number of students securing A or A* grades, compared to % for state schools and .% for further education colleges.  Amid an outcry, ministers had promised a apostriple lockapos in which students could appeal using a mock A-level result instead. They also axed appeal fees. But the detail of the appeal system still hasnapost launched and there is confusion over what it will say. Ofqual yesterday said mocks may not guarantee a higher grade,the teachersapos original predictions were still lower than the mock result. But that guidance was hurriedly withdrawn last night. The Good Law Project will argue Ofqual breached its legal duty to ensure grades give a reliable indication of knowledge, skills and understanding when it enacted the marking policy. Its pre-action letter demands a response by this Wednesday adding: This claim is extremely urgent. It may still be possible for these students to attend their Universities of choice in Octobera lawful system is put in place.  Good Law Project director Jolyon Maugham said Ofqual got it profoundly wrong and are embedding structural inequality across the system. He called for Ofqual to abandon the standardisation process and instead rely on teachersapos predictions. Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said the appeals process had turned into a “huge mess” and the U-turn over confusing guidance was “unacceptable”. He warned there may end up being no option but to ditch appeals and rely on teachersapos original predicted grades, like in Scotland. The six students in the Good Law Project action include Lina, a daughter of a single mum in the West Midlands who was predicted A*A*AA.  Those grades were cut to ABBC by the algorithm - depriving her of her place to study Mathematics and Economics at the London School of Economics. Luckily she managed to be accepted by her insurance choice, Warwick University. She said: I often place top of my class. I am well liked by my teachers and did well in my mock exams. But my grades issued by Ofqual did not reflect any of that. Another claimant, Charlotte, had her A*AA predicted grades lowered to ABC despite getting  A*s in her GCSEs. She wanted to follow in her parentsapos footsteps and become a doctor, but her university place has now been deferred to next year pending an appeal.

The EU sets aposMaximum Residue Limitsapos, which control how much of a medicine, pesticide or other product is allowed to be present in an animalaposs carcass. Currently these EU limits are written into UK law. But a little-noticed Brexit law, passed last year, said that in future the UK will set these limits behind closed doors - not in the letter of the law. While the UK government has pledged it will keep all existing EU MRLs, itaposs understood in future the UK will set appropriate MRLs of its own choosing.  Friends of the Earth warned the change could give a blank slate to set new, weaker standards and water down our environmental protections. The current list includes an antibiotic called monensin, used in cows in the US but limited to  microgrammes per kilogram in beef fat here. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsinsisted the limit on it will remain. But Kierra Box of Friends of the Earth said: “Ministers keep saying that the UK standards we have now will remain, but this shows that promise just doesn’t wash.

Furious teenagers yesterday demonstrated in Westminster after the exam system was plunged into chaos when two in five A-level marks were lowered. And England’s Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was urged by a Tory predecessor to delay this Thursday’s GCSE results amid fears pupils face the same “unfair” fate. About , teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should receive their marks. Scotland’s results came out on August . Schools assigned grades to pupils after exams were scrapped amid the pandemic. But A-level results day ended in farce as .% of teachers’ estimates were adjusted down by one grade or more by a computer algorithm. According to regulator Ofqual’s analysis, pupils in disadvantaged areas were marked down the most harshly. Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of being “invisible in this crisis” and demanded action to right the A-level wrongs and stop GCSE results going the same way.And deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “Where is the Prime Minister hiding  He must take personal ­responsibility for the A-levels results crisis and in the next  hours he must explain to students, parents and teachers precisely how he will end this historic injustice.” National Association of Headteachers union general secretary Paul Whiteman said time was running out to prevent a second scandal. He said: “The Government needs to get a grip and take rapid action to restore confidence, fairness and stability, for young people who received A-level grades but also those receiving GCSEs in days to come.” Former Education Secretary Lord Baker, who oversaw the launch of GCSEs in the s, insisted the results should be postponed. He said: “I urge the Education Secretary to instruct Ofqual not to release GCSE results on Thursday as their algorithm is flawed. The A-level results have produced hundreds of thousands of unfair and barely explicable ­downgrades. They have helped smaller private schools but hit the brighter students in a poorly performing state school.” He added: “If you are in a hole, stop digging. The results should be postponed for two weeks.  “The Government can then decide either to accept predicted grades or invite heads to resubmit new predictions.” There was further disbelief in Westminster after guidance for students in England seeking to appeal against their grades was suddenly withdrawn without explanation. Ofqual said on Saturday students could challenge the outcome on the basis of mock exam results, but the advice was taken down hours later. It said the policy was “being reviewed” by its board and details would be released “in due course”. The Department for Education declined to comment.  Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green blasted Government “chaos and incompetence” adding: “The Tories’ results fiasco is turning from tragedy to farce. “A credible appeals system should have been the Government’s first priority, but three days later there is absolutely no clarity on how young people can challenge unfair grades.” It came as hundreds of furious ­teenagers marched on the Department for Education, with dozens sitting on the ground at the front door. Protesters chanted “vote them out”, with many holding signs referencing the next election. Tom Loach, , retook his A-levels hoping to improve on the three Bs he got last year.

Playing fast and loose with the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of teenagers is another kick in the teeth for pupils. Cancelling exams and shutting schools to most students to halt the spread of the virus undoubtedly harmed teenagers’ education but most people understand that big decisions had to be taken in a hurry. What most people do not and will not forgive is the resulting chaos. Teachers often get it wrong when predicting grades yet they still know far more about inidual children than a criticised, controversial, condemned computer model. Every child is supposed to matter. It’s unforgivable that this Tory Government is writing off so many of them. Plane stupid Easing lockdown restrictions in areas where the virus rate falls is a recognition the danger ies between communities. And that exposes the unpopular contradiction in the Government’s blanket approach to other countries: Huge nations are treated as single threat zones, with visitors required to quarantine for a fortnight on ing eventhey stayed in places with few or no cases.

The NHS Covid- Vaccine Research Registry will help large-scale vaccine studies take place across the UK. National Institute for Health Research director Dinesh Saralaya said: The best way to protect us from future outbreaks is to develop effective vaccines. “Several vaccine trials are being conducted around the UK in the coming months and it is important that we all sign up to be contacted about them. I would like to reassure people that research trials and studies are strictly regulated for ethics and safety.”  He added: By working together, we can produce efficient vaccines which are likely to protect all sections of our society from this dreadful virus in future.” Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said: “The more people who volunteer to take part the more likely we find an answer to whether any vaccine is effective."},{"url":null,"title":"ae nurse more doubles pay","story":"NewsAE nurse more than doubles pay turning to adult websites due to coronavirus cutsEXCLUSIVE: Women, including an AE nurse, a graphic designer and a single mum, are making ­thousands of pounds posting nude or lingerie-clad photographs and videos to paying subscribers onlineShareCommentsByKelly Jenkins:,  AUG NewsNurse Nicola Willoughby saw her shts cut back so has found other ways to make money\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Some women have been making ­thousands of pounds by posting nude or lingerie-clad photographs and videos to paying subscribers online. But while critics have raised ­concerns about revenge porn, others say it is an empowering way for ­women to make a living – and even describe it as a “leline”. Website OnlyFans, which has  million ­users and , “creators”, ­reported a  per cent rise in sign-ups during March and April, while Fanzworld doubled its subscribers. Here, three women who signed up to adult-only subscription sites during lockdown explain why they did it – and how it has kept them financially afloat during the pandemic. Bar Manager Catherine Single mum Catherine, , says fan sites were “a godsend” to her after she went into lockdown facing serious financial hardship.She had been earning £, a month for nearly two years but, because she was self-employed, she found herself without any income when the bar she managed was forced to close. She said: “I totally fell through the gap. It was horrendous. “I needed two years’ worth of accounts to qualy for support and was only three months short of that. “It meant I was entitled to nothing – I couldn’t get help from the government and couldn’t be furloughed. “I was offered £ a month universal credit but that wouldn’t even cover my rent, never mind gas, electricity and feeding my kids, who are seven and . “We were all at home, so the electricity was being used all day and I had to feed my kids more because they weren’t getting their school meals. I panicked because I went from a full-time wage to nothing.” So when friends told Catherine about online adult subscription sites, she signed up. She said: “For me, it was a total leline. I made £, in the first month, after joining Fanzworld and OnlyFans. “Without that work I would have lost everything. “The fan sites were a godsend and got me out of a really sticky situation. “I didn’t feel brilliant having to do it,I’m honest. But lockdown put a lot of people in really bad situations. “I was lucky to find a way out. I’ve had friends take their lives because of financial struggles during the pandemic.”  Catherine, from Preston, Lancs, posted topless photos and glamour shots on the websites, but made sure she always felt comfortable with what she was doing. She said: “Sometimes I would just post a picture of me soaking up the sun in the garden. “The men would pay more for a chat on messenger online and that sometimes felt like a normal chat with a friend. “I had some lovely fans who understood why I was doing what I did and would send money to help me out. “Lots of people have a really bad perception of fan sites and think they’re sleazy, but it’s not what you think and you can make a fortune. You get to set your own standards and charge accordingly. “My subscribers paid £ a month and came from all over the world. A lot of the men in the UK were bored, home alone in lockdown and just wanted interaction.” She added: “I never worried about revenge porn because the men who sign up for these sites often don’t want people knowing.” Catherine now works in security – and runs courses to help get people back into employment after lockdown. She said: “This was a stop gap for me, but it really helped me through what would have been an unbearable time.” AE Nurse Nicola  Mum-of-four Nicola turned to adult sites when her nursing shts in AE were cut during the pandemic. The -year-old said: “I’ve been working in healthcare for  years. While coronavirus was at its peak our shts were reduced to stop there being too many people in the department. “It was such a depressing time, with everything that was going on. I decided to sign up to some sites initially for the fun of it and as an escape.” But Nicola, from Lincoln, earned £, in her first month – much more than her £, nurse’s pay. She said: “I am very careful about what I post. I keep it extremely tasteful. I post pictures or short video clips in swimwear, bikinis or gym wear. “I know some girls go totally nude, but I don’t – and I still do well. “I don’t worry about revenge porn because the pictures I post are no dferent from the holiday photos other women post on Instagram. “The only dference is I’m getting paid for it. I don’t do anything distasteful or harmful.” She added: “I’ve had negative comments from people who have said I do porn, but this isn’t porn. “It’s a legitimate way to make money during a tough time. And it has been a huge help financially.” Graphic Designer Abi  Abi turned to fan sites after she lost her job in the lockdown. The -year-old, who graduated from Leeds Beckett University in , was earning £, a year designing artwork for a paint brush company. She said: “I loved it. It’s what I always wanted to do.” But then coronavirus hit and Abi was made redundant. She joined several sites – including Glamour Lounge Live, which runs live webcams. She said: “I was nervous but because I can’t see the men viewing me I quickly built up my confidence. I’m now making an average of £ a week. I do worry about people re-posting my images, but I won’t post anything too explicit. I still want to go back into Graphic Design but this is a good alternative for now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boys powerful letter begging see","story":"NewsBoys powerful letter begging to see dad still in prison  years after stealing phoneKayden White, , has never spent Christmas with his dad Thomas after he was given an Imprisonment for Public Protection sentence that only frees prisoners after passing parole and was originally intended for much more serious crimesShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  AUG NewsKayden White has called for his dads release\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

It emerged earlier this week that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex bought a palatial nine-bedroom Calornian estate from Russian investor Sergey Grishin. Grishin and his ex-we Anna Fedoseeva are currently embroiled in an intense legal battle. He denies her claims that he held a gun to her head and knocked her teeth out. Now Fedoseeva has spoken out against her former partner, calling him a aposdangerous manapos. “Meghan struggles for women’s rights, but in my case, that means just to be alive, she told The Sun on Sunday. Fedoseeva said she did not think that Harry and Meghan were aware of Grishin when they bought the property, but suggested that their advisors might have done more due diligence before the purchase. The -year-old said: “He put me through hell, with domestic violence, assaults and threats to me and all my loved ones. She added: I do not think it wise for anyone to surround themselves with Sergey Grishin. Billionaire Grishin is the former owner of another nearby home, known as the Scarface mansion after it appeared in the  Al Pacino movie. In court documents it is alleged that he sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images to his we andSulkess in text and video messages, the Sun reported.  It is alleged he texted Fedoseeva claiming he had a Glock for her. The same documents include allegations that he pointed a gun with a silencer at her head and forced her to strip. Grishin denies the claims. A spokesperson for the Russian said he was the aposvictim of a fraudapos and claimed his ex-we planned to defraud him of millions of dollars to fund her le with her new partner, MailOnline reported. Grishin later claimed, in a lawsuit filed in Calornia, that his we and her new partner Sulkess were lovers and they were trying to trick him out of millions of dollars. When that failed she Fedoseeva began making aposapos claims against Grishin, the spokesperson added.  Fedoseeva told MailOnline: I keep reading articles which say that Harry and Meghan have aposquietlyapos bought this house. Regardless of the homeaposs former owners, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will now need to find almost £, per month over the next  years to cover the repayments, property taxes and insurances. The couple managed to secure a mortgage despite still owing the British taxpayer £.million for the renovation of Frogmore Cottage, their former home near Windsor Castle. It was previously agreed the former senior royals would pay £, a month to repay the cost of refurbishing the cottage which they left when they left the UK in November last year.  A source said: All combined, Harry and Meghan need to find around £, per month to meet their financial commitments. It is a staggering amount. No wonder they want to get working. The couple had faced paying much more for their new home, but after haggling over the price for the ,-square-foot house, they managed to knock more than £. million of the asking price. Harry, , and Meghan, , eventually landed the mansion which boasts a rose garden, pool, theatre, arcade, childrenaposs play area and guest house,for £. million after putting down a £. million deposit.  It also has a stripper pole installed in its gym. Pictures previously taken inside the home show high beamed ceilings, mock real fires, a library, ten-seater dining room, spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, theatre and a wine cellar. Guests can be entertained in the games room complete with poker table,pinball machines, bar and pool table.

The swirling watery vortex was spotted at around pm today near Portishead. The liquid whirlwind was caught on video by Liza Manners who shared it online, Bristol Post reported. It was also captured by Russ Turneraposs nine-year-old son Will. Russ wrote on Twitter : Exciting stuff, caught the #funnelcloud over the estuary off #redclfebay between #Clevedon and #Portishead this afternoon at :. This was a big one, smaller one formed a bit later as the #thunderstorm moved away. Waterspouts are whirling columns of air and water mist caused by strong winds which extend from the base of the cloud to the water below. BBC Points West weatherman Ian Fergusson, a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society, said: Itaposs an impressive sight. Iaposve seen a handful reported over that area in the past decade and this is certainly one of the most spectacular. Mr Fergusson said aposheavy showersapos grew quickly across North Somerset as they approached the Portishead shore from the southeast.  In doing so, these were quickly boosted by a localised wind pattern that created some aposspinapos in the lower atmosphere above Redclfe Bay, he added. As the shower grew, these winds created a vortex - the funnel cloud visible in photos. In turn, it reached to the sea surface, where a ring of spray confirms the apostouchdownapos. This means itaposs a phenomenon called a waterspout: a tornado over water. Keen weather fan Olly Ewers noted that the aposBristol Channel can quite often see funnel clouds due to sea breezes and winds from dferent directionsapos.

However, she denied responsibility for the abusive messages, claiming other people with access to the profile had posted them. The account ranted about aposugly a** british aristocratic vapid do-nothing b****esapos. It also tweeted: Let me cyberbully in peace Iaposm reflecting and apologizing in a couple of years too.

Thereaposs no suggestion the Duke or Duchess knew about the offensive messages being posted. But it comes as Harry and Meghan called for businesses to stop funding social media sites that stoke a crisis of hate. Ms Trin, who reportedly just graduated from university in Portugal, co-founded the #InspiredByMeghan fundraising initiative, which sponsors scholarships for girls in rural Africa through Camfed. Speaking to the Sun, she denied posting the abusive messages, adding that seven other so-called aposSussex Squadapos members also used the profile. The aposHenryscousinapos account has since been deleted. “I feel like it’s not my place to condemn or approve another person’s tweets, she told the paper. “It’s their opinion. Henryscousin was like a forum and I had no control what other ­people posted. “The group disbanded and the account was deactivated due to irreconcilable dferences.” The Duke of Sussex recently accused social media giants of stoking a crisis of hate and called on advertisers to use their spending power to transform the industry.

Carter Reece Lamb lost his le to a rare disease on July .His mum Victoria said she would remember the nine-year-old as someone who was happy no matter what, Nottingham Post reported. I got my strength from Carter because he fought through and never lost his personality, the -year-old said. Even when he was so ill and became so skinny, he wanted to play and do what he enjoyed. In his final days he was smiling - he kept me going. Carter was born with a rare form of Mitochondrial diseasethe specics of which still remain unknown. Mito is a term given to a group of medical disorders caused by mutations in the tiny organelles that are present in nearly every cell in our bodies. When those cells donapost work properly, the effects can be serious and wide ranging. Carter was left unable to absorb nutrients from his food. As a result he had to visit hospital on a monthly and sometimes weekly basis. Shortly after he was first diagnosed doctors told Victoria that Carter would not make it past three. He defied the odds though and did so with a smile. As long as his pain was under control, he was just always happy, Victoria said. Everyone knows his smile, he was very cheeky and loved being around other children. As the years went on Carter, who attended Oak Field School in Bilborough, had to deal with more and more health problems. On one occasion he suffered a cardiac arrest where his heart stopped for six minutes.  But after spending a week in intensive care with a breathing tube, Victoria remembers the moment it was removed, he smiled and took a breath on his own. While there was a spell of success for Carter after he had a special aposmini buttonapos feeding tube attached, which helped to prevent him becoming sick as often, the symptoms soon started to .Victoria said: The doctors tried everything to help him - he was given a PICC line for feeding but he got sepsis within a week so it was too risky to try again.He was losing weight constantly as the disease meant his body didnapost have the energy to absorb food. It got to the point where we were basically living in hospital and they just said there was nothing more they could really do. It was decided that it was best to stay at home and for his last eight weeks he just had milk but his body had given up. He basically starved and two days before he died, he weighed just kg. After nearly losing Carter when he stopped breathing at home, Victoria was told that it was his bodyaposs way of telling her it wouldnapost be long. She decided to take Carter to the Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People in Loughborough. I wanted him to pass peacefully and we arrived on the Friday, and then they brought in another bed so I could lie with him, she added. I just held him in my arms, we had sensory lights on which he loved and it was so calm.  It brought me some comfort after he fought for as long as he could. I think I was in denial and thought he would just keep fighting, so it has taken time to sink in. Victoria was accompanied by her mother, Elizabeth Flanagan, who she said was the closest person to herself and Carter. Elizabeth, , said: He brought so much joy into my le and Iaposm so proud of him. At Carteraposs funeral, he was laid to rest with his toys including a teddy from his favourite character in The Lion King, Simba which he watched often. He had a really big personality and would always show you what he wanted, Victoria added. He wanted to know what was happening and who people were. He left a mark on whoever he met. I loved being his mummy and doing all his care needs and I would do it all over againI could. In the wake of his death, friends of Victoria have set up a fund to provide some support to her, while she figures out her next steps.

Miners at the Bradley surface mine at Leadgate, County Durham, will extract their last coal on Monday. The closure was announced after the local authority refused permission to extend the site. Operator Banks Mining says  skilled jobs are at risk in the family-owned firm, which still runs mines in Scotland and South Wales. Mining industry bosses and the National Union of Mineworkers both accused the Government of stalling on planning applications.  Gavin Styles, managing director of Banks Mining, hit out over the Government’s failure to give approval for new mines. He said: “As we face a recession, the Government has a choice between allowing miners... to keep their jobs, and upsetting campaigners. “Its cynical refusal to even announce a decision is why the British public has completely lost faith in politicians.” The closure comes five years after miners left Britain’s last deep coal mine, Kellingley Colliery in Yorkshire, for the final time. At its height the industry employed a million people. Chris Kitchen, national secretary of the NUM, said: “This is nothing short of industrial sabotage, that political games are being played which are costing British miners jobs under the guise that it is environmentally friendly. We are outsourcing the carbon footprint to other countries like Russia. “We are not reducing the carbon footprint, in fact we are then increasing it by importing foreign-mined coal to burn.

The -year-old was dragged to his death after he was caught in a crane strap as he tried to stop three thieves fleeing after they stole a quad bike in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, on August  last year. The Thames Valley Police traffic officer had only been married to long-term girlfriend Lissie Harper for four weeks when he died. Mrs Harper said listening to some of the details about her loved oneaposs death during the Old Bailey trial made her feel the most anger towards those vile savages in the dock.  Speaking to the Daily Mail, she said defendants Henry Long, , and -year-olds Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, looked like they were sitting in the headteacheraposs office.They were waving up to the public gallery at their families asit was all just a day out. They were laughing and joking. She said as soon Judge Andrew Edis and the jury came into court the atmosphere changed and they wiped the smirks off of their faces and behaved like model pupils.Yet the second the jury left the court, the charade left, too. They were nudging each other, messing about, their shirts became untucked and they looked again like the excuse for human beings they were, continued Mrs Harper. Whenever they left the court room we could all hear them shouting, like football fans on the terraces. They looked over at us a lot, but not with any kind of sorrow I could see.The trial had initially begun in March but was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic and a re-trial was held from June .After the three teenagers were found not guilty of murder on July , she said they patted each other on the back astheyaposd won a football match.

The lavish , sq ft property - designed and built by multi-millionaire businessman Terry Cunningham and his we Randi - is so technologically advanced that it can detect fog rolling in from the Pacic ocean. Set in . acres of spectacular land in Montecito, The Chateau is based on a classic French country house, and is surrounded by sweeping lawns, rose gardens, huge Italian cypress trees, blooming lavender and -year-old olive trees. Mr Cunningham and his we spent four years building the plush nine-bedroom mansion after buying the land in , creating a dream home for themselves and their children to make memories.

In , devastating mudslides came within ft of the property, after being triggered by heavy rain in the hills nearby which had been ravaged by wildfires.We sure as hell didnapost think about it when we were building, but certainly itaposs something I would be thinking about now, said Mr Cunningham, now , in an interview with the Mail on Sunday.

It was our dream home and we built it as a family home and we still love the place, said Mr Cunningham.

He also detailed how he designed and built the wine cellar using plywood from his brotheraposs mill, and poured wine on the floor so that it smelled correctly.

Trials of the test were part funded with half a million dollars contributed by the NBA and playersapos union. The process is favoured by some sports teams because it is cheap, non-invasive and can use readily available reagents. Nathan Grubaugh, assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health, told Mail Online: We simplied the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about  per sample. Prior to the leagueapossNBA players were tested with the saliva tests and nasal swabs. Almost all of the results matched when compared. SalivaDirect can have results back with the subject within  hours and can cost up to less than nasal swabs.  The ease, speed and relative low cost of the test has been a cause for optimism within the world of sports.As well as it providing an easy way for teams to test their players, it may also allow members of the public to find out whether they caught the coronavirus before attending games."},{"url":null,"title":"woman 200 great grandchildren celebrates","story":"NewsWoman with  great-grandchildren celebrates th birthday with a drive-thru partyHester Ford, the oldest woman in the United States, was wheeled out to the door of her home where she was greeted by friends, family and her community.

The tragic case was one of the most shocking examples of domestic abuse in Australian history. Hannah suffered burns to  per cent of her body and her children Aaliyah, six, Laianah, four, and Trey, three, died at the scene. Baxter, who trained for the New Zealand Warriors in the NRL, then killed himself by stabbing himself in the chest.

Monica Elizabeth Young, , has been charged with repeatedly having sex with a boy. CCTV footage of the Sydney car park shows the geography teacheraposs motor pulling up. The video, which investigators have obtained, does not offer a glimpse inside the vehicle. Young, who is engaged to be married, has denied having sex in the car with the pupil, New South Wales Supreme Court heard. It is also alleged that on another occasion the boy put his hands inside her tights in the classroom, Mail Online reported. Young allegedly instigated the action by putting a hand on his thigh - an act police say may have been seen by another student. In court Youngaposs barrister Ian Lloyd QC said prosecutors were aposexaggeratingapos claims about sexual contact. He argued that CCTV merely showed the boy with his hand under the table, rather than in her tights as the lawyers suggested.  Mr Lloyd said a Snapchat she sent him with the caption aposIaposm waiting for himapos beside a picture of her on a bed did not show any sexual activity. Prosecutor Scott Jaegar argued Young posed a risk to the alleged victim, Mail Online reported. He said the boy did not want her released for fear she would target other children.  When the teenageraposs mother became suspicious, Young allegedly changed her Snapchat identity to that of a boy to avoid suspicion. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Campbell granted the teacher bail on the conditions her family put up ,AUand that she remain under house arrest. She had previously spent a month behind bars at Silverwater Womenaposs Prison.

Remember there’s another manager coming in after’.“Maybe that didn’t help!”He joined from Rangers a -year-old, for a reported £,, in  and his arrival coincided with a spark in form that led Scott’s Dundee to equal the best top-flight finish since the league-winning side of  .But less than  months later, when Boyack wasn’t given a squad number by incoming boss Bonetti, he knew it was all over.A former Scotland U  international, the midfielder had been on the fringes of Walter Smith’s Rangers squad during the Nine in a Row era.Despite making his debut in  alongside the likes of Andy Goram, Richard Gough, Jorg Albertz, Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup – and up against Ray Wilkins in the Hibs team – he eventually moved on in search of first-team football.Step forward Dundee, with family ties making it the perfect move.“I had been at Rangers a while and it was time to move on,” he said.“I had family connections to Dundee, my dad was a big fan and was always talking about ducking school so he could go watch the AC Milan European Cup semi-final.“I think that local connection helped and I was quite happy people knew that. Dundee is a small place and I remember my granny from Broughty Ferry getting on the bus with me and saying to everyone, ‘This is my grandson, he plays for Dundee!’“It was the right move and it was great, for the most part anyway – it ended really badly.“Things started off great and I loved it at Dens. As much I was on the fringes of the first team at Rangers and playing in the reserves, Dundee was my first real club where I played consistent first-team football.“It was exciting times and completely dferent to reserve football – it’s just not the same pressure as a young guy at Rangers.“That was boy’s football – I was playing the men’s game at Dundee.“Suddenly it was a relegation battle and there’s all these experienced guys who are playing for a contract or to avoid a wage cut by being relegated.“The pressure was much more, suddenly everything was about  o’clock on a Saturday. Nothing  mattered.”The news was out that fans’ favourite Dariusz Adamczuk was leaving for Ibrox in the summer after three years at the club.Boyack said: “I remember there was a story at the time I was being brought in to replace Adamczuk because he was leaving on a Bosman, going to Rangers funnily enough.“I think it might have been right after I signed when Dariusz got sent off at Dunfermline and got a six-game ban. That gave me my start in the team.“We went on a run after that and won five on the bounce near the end of the season.“We had a good hard-working team with youth and experience mixed well, with some good players in there as well.“It was lucky how it started for me but brilliant as well.”Boyack made his first start the following week in a - win over Hearts before playing the final seven matches of the season, winning five, drawing one and losing the final match against third-placed St Johnstone.He also notched his first senior goal in a win at Pittodrie and followed up with another at home to Dunfermline as Jocky’s side romped up the ision and into a fth-placed finish.Boyack added: “I think at that time Dunfermline were at the bottom but they weren’t a million miles away from us so we needed those wins.“Jocky Scott andJimmy Bone made things very easy for us players, they were pretty old school and they built a good team. There were no favourites, they picked the best team.“We had guys like Gavin Rae in midfield, Iain Anderson, Eddie Annand, Willie Falconer, James Grady then there was Rab Douglas who wasn’t far off the best keeper in the league, he was brilliant.“Really dependable guys like Barry Smith and Brian Irvine, then there was Willie Miller who helped me a lot – anyone who kicked me, he’d kick them back twice as hard!“I think we must have had snot s of Premier League games of experience in that team but young players as well.”The following season, Boyack was a regular in the Dark Blues midfield with only Rae, Douglas and Steven Tweed featuring more for Scott’s men.The Dark Blues would finish seventh, just one point off repeating their fth place of the campaign before.However, that signalled the end of Jocky’s spell in charge and he made way for the flamboyant Bonetti regime.It was clear early on that there were going to be huge changes at Dundee and, unsurprisingly, the new manager didn’t fancy some of the stars he had inherited.But Boyack, who had played  times in the Premier League the previous season, wasn’t too concerned despite several warning signs.“We went on a pre-season trip to Italy and they didn’t seem to know who any of the Scottish players were!” he said.“Some of the older guys were saying the writing was on the wall but I didn’t listen. I said, ‘I’ve got a contract for another year andthey don’t want me, I’ll go somewhere .’”Boyack soon realised the experienced members of the Dark Blues squad were spot on and he was eventually put on the transfer list.It was too late, however, to go anywhere – a problem for a club needing to recoup some of the money they had already spent on new players.At the time, a frustrated Boyack told the Courier: “The managersaid I would remain here until another club met Dundee’s valuation but he spoke to me while watching a football video and I only got  seconds of his time.“No one has told me I am not good enough to play for Dundee and I’ve not become a bad player overnight but it’s now best I move on.”Twenty years on, Boyack is philosophical about his Dens dream turning into a nightmare under Ivano and his brother Dario.He said: “I didn’t play a minute under them but the club had a problem because they’d signed a lot of players but they’d done that before getting rid of the players they didn’t fancy.“I didn’t even get a squad number. They were bringing in good players and they gave my number to Fabian Caballero. He was brilliant so at least they gave it to somebody pretty decent.“ThenCaniggia came in#had somebody said when I signed a year before he’d be there I’d have said they were mad.“They told me really late in the summer that I could go but, at that point, a lot of teams already had their squads signed up.“There was a chance to go to Hibs but they brought in Didier Agathe from Raith Rovers and it ended up being too late for me. It felt like the goalposts had moved.“I eventually dropped down a ision on loan to Ayr in October because I couldn’t go on loan to another Premier League team.“I imagineI had dug my heels in about it all, I maybe wouldn’t have played for a whole year.“Ideally I wanted to continue playing at Dundee and play in semi-finals or finals because I knew what it would mean for the club and the fans.”He added: “For a while I was maybe not quite bitter but disappointed at the way things went. With a bit more time and experience you start to understand clubs do certain things.“I enjoyed it at Dundee, people always ask about the way things ended but it’s blown out of proportion really.“I bump into Peter Marr quite a lot actually and it all doesn’t matter now. I would have loved to have played another ,  games but it wasn’t to be.”Boyack would only play  times for Ayr before Craig Levein snapped him up for Hearts in a £, deal.He made  appearances in three years at Tynecastle. His most consistent football, however, was played at Dens Park under Jocky Scott.Now working in the construction and engineering trade, he says some of his best moments in the game came during his stint in the City of Discovery.“My best memories include my first derby. I remember walking across the road to Tannadice, I’d never done anything like that before.“It’s funny, you always remember the games you did better in! Big Brian Irvine scored, that was great for the big man, then I played in James Grady to get the winner and we won -.“I also remember going to Ibrox and winning. Rangers were flying at that point, seriously flying.“They’d just beaten Dortmund a few days before. My mates were saying we were in for a hiding and I didn’t disagree.“But they didn’t turn up and Gav Rae popped up in the last minute. I don’t know how many times Dundee have won at Ibrox but that was a great time.“And we were at a supporter’s do that night too. On the road down some of the boys were saying it was the worst time to have that, coming back from a game at Ibroxwe got stuffed.“Turns out it wasn’t a bad night after all!”Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans\" title\"#Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kane-hemmings-says-decision embed # secretqvAoqpAp\" data-secret\"qvAoqpAp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is. I know many people who find it incredibly dficult, not great when in the middle of nowhere miles from home.In a nutshell the key is to carry out all paper and sanitary waste in a sealable bag, to go aMountaineering Scotland has excellent online guidance on how to dispose of your natural waste.I hope, like me, you will wish to continue to enjoy nature and take the time to care for and immerse your senses in this beautul world we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"golf clubs set to benefit from covid support fund","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs that have been affected financially by the coronavirus pandemic are being offered support via a funding package funded by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.In total the funding is worth £, and clubs affiliated to Scottish Golf can apply for grants being made available via two separate allocations the Covid- Fixed Costs Grant and the Club Relief Fund.Fixed Costs Grant will enable every affiliated club in Scotland to apply for aThese can include but are not exhaustive of sanitation products, Covid-related health and safety equipment, professional fees, signs, training, video conferencing licenceand any other Covid-related spend.The Club Relief Fund has been created to provide financial support to clubs who have been impacted by the pandemic and is concentrated on enabling clubs to reinstate or to increase expenditure in key areas to either improve member experience or boost income generation potential.Clubs applying to this fund are required to complete a four-stage application to ensure the review committee have the correct information available to allocate funds.The information required includes:• Standard Club Criteria and AgreementA Scottish Golf spokesperson said: #While the provision of this funding is most welcome, we do anticipate the volume of applications to be high and the criteria outlined will be strictly applied to ensure that the funds available are distributed where most needed.#We continue to explore other funding options for clubs to access and will communicate any additional opportunities should these arise.#The application process for both grants is open now until Friday July .

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope. And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice.

No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus.

Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"lawyers-academics-call-government-end-julian-assange-extradition","story":"Lawyers and legal academics have called on the UK Government to end extradition proceedings against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and release him from prison.Assange is fighting to avoid being sent to the US to face  charges under the Espionage Act and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion after the publication of hundreds of thousands of classied documents in  and .In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Home Secretary Priti Patel,  iniduals and international legal organisations called for the Government to intervene.If extradited, campaigners said the -year-old will face a ldquoshow trial in the US.They added he has been subject to surveillance which violates his right to a fair trial.ldquoWe call on you to act in accordance with national and international law, human rights and the rule of law by bringing an end to the ongoing extradition proceedings and granting Mr Assange his long overdue freedom, the letter, signed Lawyers for Assange, reads.The signatories include barrister Lord John Hendy QC and groups including the UKrsquos Arab Lawyers Association as well as the European Association of Lawyers for Democracy and World Human Rights.The letter said the political nature of Assangersquos alleged offences prohibits his extradition under the US-UK extradition treaty and that UK judges in his case have been subject to conflicts of interest.They added Assange is at risk of torture or cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment in the US, citing the potential -year sentence.In June, more than  doctors from  countries signed a letter accusing UK and American officials of ldquointensying Julian Assangersquos psychological torture in The Lancet.Assange has been held in Belmarsh Prison in south east London, awaiting proceedings after serving a -week sentence for breaching his bail.In the letter, Lawyers for Assange said this was an ldquoirregular and disproportionate sentence and stressed the need for his release given the Covid- pandemic and his health.Campaigners also said Assangersquos extradition would endanger the freedom of the press.vw,vw,px, px\"Dame Vivienne Westwood said the extradition bid was a lsquostitch-uprsquo in a protest last month The letter said: ldquoThe extradition to the US of a publisher and journalist, for engaging in journalistic activities while in Europe, would set a very dangerous precedent.In July, dozens of press freedom, human rights and privacy rights organisations co-signed an open letter to the UK Government calling for Assangersquos immediate release from prison.Assangersquos extradition hearing, originally set for May, was postponed as a result of the coronavirus lockdown measures and was rescheduled for September  at the Old Bailey.Last month supporter and fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood called efforts to extradite Assange a ldquostitch-up.Dressed in canary yellow and suspended in a giant birdcage outside the Old Bailey, Dame Vivienne said: ldquoJulian Assange is in a cage and he needs to get out.

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather

The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-clifftop-castle-tales","story":"I have always wanted to visit it, but never seemed to get the opportunity then suddenly, a day of sunny weather last week combined with some free time made a trip possible.The walk to the castle was stunning, with purple heather-clad braes and a sparkling sea. To add to the magic, we saw dolphins as we approached the ruins.There is actually little left of the castle itself: small chunks of masonry jutting out like broken teeth are the only obvious evidence to the existence of the clf-top fortress.But itrsquos the location, and the stories attached to it, which tingle the spine.Itrsquos a steep descent to it, and care needs to be taken as you near the castle, for the path veers dangerously close to the edge of the clfs.We took it gradually, with a distant view of the ruins enticing us. A solid cement walkway now links the promontory to the mainland, where once a drawbridge gave access to the castle. The kids crossed it, one by one, with help from me and my we Kate. Itrsquos at this point, as you enter the historic remains, that the power of the location is truly revealed.Itrsquos like walking into lsquothe godsrsquo of a giant natural amphitheatre, with clfs looming on both sides, and sheer drops below. The sound of the open sea and gulls swamp your senses, and I was thankful we had visited when it was calm, for I can imagine a visit on a windy day would give the precipitous edges an almost terrying character. We settled down for our picnic where once the great hall stood, with breathtaking views.Whenever I visit such places, itrsquos not just what is seen that inspires me itrsquos the stories of the place. Here the ghosts of the past wait to tell you their tale,you have an ear to listen. And what tales are sewn onto this rocky top!The castle gets its first mention in the early s, but for sure human habitation predates that. In , the English captured it and it remained in English hands for the rest of that century a stone in the shoe of south-east Scotland. It was finally retaken in  by the forces of Patrick Dunbar but later it became a rebuilt stronghold of the Home family.History records that they hosted the young princess Margaret Tudor here in  as she headed north to become Scotlandrsquos queen, with her marriage to James IV and thus change the destiny of both countries.She will have shared the views we had while we ate our picnic, although I suspect her banquet may have been a little more indulgent. Who can say what impressions this wild view gave her of her new homeland.Her granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots, would visit the castle  years later in , in what for her was a very turbulent time.How I wished the few stones of the castle that still stood could tell a story of these remarkable women, who had to navigate their royal privilege through misogynist contempt.After being abandoned, the castlersquos windswept ruins were the haunt of smugglers and wreckers, who would set a light amongst the old stones, making it look like a welcoming port.But it was the story of Madge Gordon that was foremost in my mind as I sat amongst the ruins of the castle that, according to the tale, she helped liberate from the English.The story is called the lsquoGuid We of Coldinghamrsquo and it is to be found in Wilsonrsquos Tales of the Borders. These were a fantastic collection of stories written by John Mackay Wilson in the early th century. Today, the Wilsonrsquos Tales Project promotes his work, which was prodigious.It is a tale set in the grim times of the Rough Wooing in the s, when English forces were using force and terror to persuade the Scots to agree to the marriage of the young Mary Queen of Scots to Edward Tudor.Madge was a widow with an abiding hatred of the English occupiers, who had killed her husband. Her daughter Janet was in love with a young man called Florence, but Madge would only agree to their marriagethe young man showed his loyalty and mettle by helping her to take Fast Castle, which had been occupied by English forces.This he agreed to do, and raised a force of over a hundred local people. Madge hatched a plan to attack the castle, but both she and Florence kept it secret from Janet. She feared for her loversquos le, and felt strongly that war was pointless for it mattered not who occupied the castle as the poor folk would be oppressed either way.Madge led the attack, entering the castle in the guise of being a seller of local produce, then plunging her husbandrsquos sword into a guard. The ensuing fight was short and brutal. The young Florence fought bravely and the castle was won.After this, Madge proudly agreed that the brave Florence was worthy of her daughterrsquos hand in marriage. Janet, who had heard the commotion of the fight and rushed to the scene, desperately looked for her Florence.When she saw he was alive, she rushed joyfully to him and held him in a tight embrace. He held her likewise, saying her name ldquoJanet.But this was to be his last word spoken, for his hold on her began to weaken and his legs gave way. He had been mortally wounded in the fight. Janet screamed for help and he was carried into a room in the castle, where frantic attempts to revive him were made but he was gone.Janet plunged into inconsolable grief. She blamed her mother, and the unbearable loss sent her to the grave only two years later. Her mother followed the year after, and all three rest in Coldingham kirkyard.ldquoWhat a sad story, my we said after I had finished telling it. ldquoIs it true ldquoMaybe not in the sense you mean, I said, ldquobut it is a story with real truth: how war spawns hatred and loss, and as Janet said, the poor folk lose out whoever rules the castle.On such a sunny day, it was dficult to leave this beautul place, but the kids wanted a swim and the sun was already lowering in the sky.The walk back is a hard slog up the brae, but it gives moments to rest and catch your breath while turning to view the ruins.Here, surrounded by millions of years of geology, with the view of the tumbled remains of a castle in which lives now long forgotten were lived, a whisper is heard in the wind.ldquoWhatever your woes, whatever your joys, yours is a tiny speck in time, so use it wisely and with gratitude.On that day, I think we did just that."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

With only horse-drawn transport available, Aberlady and Gullane both felt disadvantaged without access by train.So the Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick Railway was launched as a private venture in . It soon ran into problems.Landowners denied access, requiring a detour, putting Aberlady station half a mile from the village. NBR fought any extension past Gullane to avoid competing with their own line from Drem.Such problems delayed opening until April , , when a service of nine trains a day ran between Longniddry, which had three s, and the Haddington branch. Trains ran one and a half miles to a junction at Spittal, where the line curved north, then veered east to what is now Aberlady Caravan Park. The track bed has been ed to farmland, but incongruous over-bridges on the Ballencrieff and Fenton roads mark where it once ran.Just north of the Peffer Burn, a wooden  was added in  for the exclusive use of Luffness Golf Club members.

The line was kept open to ship local sugar beet to Cupar for processing, but even that ended in .The line does have little-known claims to fame: when King George VI visited Scotland during the Second World War, his royal train was parked here as a safe location in , drivers were trained on their new diesel multiple units on this soon-to-become Beeching branch line casualty.If only NBR had foresight to build the ECML direct through Tranent and Haddington to East Linton, they could have built a truly scenic Lothian Coast Railway from Musselburgh to North Berwick ndash and ALL towns and villages between."},{"url":null,"title":"happy-ormiston-couple-toast-70th-wedding-anniversary","story":"Jenny and Harry Runciman celebrated their th wedding anniversary at their home on George Crescent.The couple married in Pencaitland Parish Church on August , .

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way.

Both hills can be climbed in one expedition but we didnrsquot arrive in Falkland until early afternoon and the short daylight hours of winter didnrsquot give us a lot of time to climb both hills and visit the Palace, so we opted for East Lomondand a wander down a fascinating little glen called Maspie Den.We parked in the village and made our way up Cross Wynd towards the hill that towered above us, completely dominating the village. It looked like a very steep climb and it was. At the top end of Cross Wynd with a rather dilapidated factory on one side and houses on the other we reached the beginning of the lsquoofficialrsquo path and the start of several long sets of wooden steps.I guess these steps were built with the best of intentions but it was obvious that most folk walk up the side of them. Whatever the merits or not of wooden steps it wasnrsquot long before we could gaze back through the beech trees and see the amount of height we had gained in a very short time. We were surprised how quickly we reached the top of the woods where the angle of the path eased sufficiently to let us get our breath back, but it wasnrsquot long before it steepened again as it climbed the final dome to the summit and its view indicator.From here we could begin to get an impression of the whole of the Lomond Hills Regional Park, a precious  square mile area of moorland, hills, lochs and farmland. The area was designated as Scotlands first Regional Park in  in recognition of its importance for recreation and conservation.As we dropped down towards the Craigmead car park we appreciated the conservation value of such parks as we watched a hen harrier quarter the moorland in search of prey. The ghostly movement of the bird was impressive, a fine raptor that is sadly being victimised by so-called sportsmen in many other areas of Scotland.The car park at Craigmead is also the starting point for climbing the slightly higher West Lomond , but we were intent on something a bit dferent ndash a walk back to Falkland by the impressive Maspie Den, finishing with a wander through the policies of the House of Falkland.Leaving the car park we crossed a field and passed through young woodland before dropping down into the Den, and what a surprise that was. The path suddenly steepens to the right and you drop into what could be described as a mini-cavern with the footpath going behind the waters of the Yad waterfall. Not really the kind of sight yoursquod expect on a walk in rural Fe!The path continues to drop down beside the burn with little sets of waterfalls to keep your interest alive. You cross several bridges before you enter woodland again. Ignore ious turn-offs to the right and continue through another unexpected feature, a dark winding tunnel that takes you into the grounds of the House of Falkland.This rather grand Jacobean-style building was the former home of the Marquess of Bute and today is a school for boys with special needs. The whole estate is still pretty impressive and the long private drive back into Falkland passes a number of interesting looking buildings, including the old stables which today house the offices of the Falkland Heritage Trust. It makes a fine ending to a great short walk.Cameron McNeishROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheets and  Start Finish: Car Park in Falkland Distance:  miles kmTime: - hoursInformation: St Andrews TIC,  . Falkland Palacehas started to reopen but beware the toilet facilities are closed. Details from nts.org.ukRoute: Leave the car park and follow Cross Wynd. Where the tarmac stops, a signposted footpath begins. Follow this up through the trees, climbing steeply with sets of wooden steps.

Ignoring signs for West Lomond, take path at top right-hand corner of Car Park and go through a gate. Cross a field and then some woodland before a small path on the R drops down into the Maspie Den. Follow the main path, ignoring turns to left and right all the way to a short tunnel. Go through the tunnel, keep on the path until you reach a gate and a tarmac road.

So, we had races going for  kilometres, huge distances, across high mountains that are freezing cold, down to % humidity rainforests, miles of swamps, grasslands, rivers.\"Youve got the ocean, so these adventure racers really went through it all, and then you have the human factor of what its actually like of trying to keep a small team of four people alive and moving and going forward when you havent slept for  days, and youre dehydrated and exhausted and youre hungry, and youre still having to make good decisions about your navigation.\"Thats why it is the worlds toughest race. And what people went through - mind blowing.\"The rebooted series is produced by Mark Burnett, who is responsible for the US versions of The Apprentice and Shark Tank.Former SAS serviceman and Chief Scout Grylls is no stranger to braving and conquering the elements himself.His Running Wild With series has seen him take on the most stomach-churning environments, with prominent guests including former US president Barack Obama.The son of politician and former Royal Marine Commando Mickey Grylls, he was recognised in the Queens Birthday Honours last year with an OBE for services to young people, the media and charity.So, as the setting for this interviewshows, the outdoors is home.But how did he feel presenting and not participating \"Its impossible not to feel that emotion, were so involved with these races, the preparation beforehand, their training and just what theyve given to be on that start line.\"And then once the race starts Im right amongst it all the time with them, but also with their support crews and what they all go through is truly inspirational,\" he says.\"When you see the tears and what people are giving to just endure and just hang on and to keep moving.\"When you see blood being poured out of boots and blisters, and yet relentless positivity and determination to hold the weakest member of the team and to still go on, it was really mind-blowing at times.\"It was a reminder for me, in an era where the world desperately needs inspiration, it was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together, when you help each other and when youre honest and vulnerable with each other.\"But also a reminder of the power of the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us, that it can conquer everything when everything is against you.\"I had tears in my eyes regularly on the Worlds Toughest Race.\"The ersity of the teams was another heartening element of the series. Twins Tashi and Nungshi Malik, from Indias Team Khukuri Warriors, wanted to inspire women.Nungshi explains: \"Coming from a country such as ours, India, were still not an outdoors nation. Its a field that is particularly viewed as reserved for males.\"Women doing anything in the outdoors is never seen as sexy as men doing it.\"For us, climbing all these massive mountains, skiing the Poles and adventure racing, really affirms our belief thatwe dream big and we commit to it, we can achieve the impossible.\"Thats what our message was for the girls in India and across the globe. Nature doesnt discriminate based on gender.\"For Team Endure, with adventure race veteran Mark Macy and son Travis among its members, the series was a poignant journey.Mark, , has Alzheimers disease, but participates in the race alongside the team.\"It was amazing to see, when you see humans overcome incredible adversity, its impossible not to be moved and inspired.\"Thats what I loved about the Worlds Toughest Race: the regular people, the regular rookies, whove already battled so much in their le, digging deep and leaning on the power of togetherness and taking on what looks like the impossible and coming through it, almost against unbelievable odds.\"Its really moving and really inspiring,\" says Grylls.And that message of positive inspiration is the viewing the world needs now, he muses.\"I think the world has never needed positive inspiration more. Weve gone through an incredible time of adversity all over the world. Every country, every community, and what I love about the Worlds Toughest Race is theres such a visual display of the qualities that matter to get people through tough times.\"The power of friendship and the power of resilience, and the ability that youve got to adapt and recover from failure and keep moving forward and to get back on your feet, and to never give up.\"Worlds Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji launches on Amazon Prime Video in the UK on August ."},{"url":null,"title":"Country Life with Rosemary Goring  The simple joys of country walking","story":"Hooletrsquos church is one of the most historic in the area.

Would you find a sense of peace in an alternative timeline or be forever haunted by what might have been Thats the question posed by The Midnight Library, the latest novel by Matt Haig. It centres on Nora Seed, a woman who is hopelessly adrt and wants her le to end. Instead, she awakes in a library, hovering in a curious existential limbo, neither alive nor dead .Each book on the librarys shelves represents a chance to confront her regrets and see how things might have turned out had she not embarked upon a certain path in her \"root le\". And, as she does so, Nora finds the answers to the questions that have long weighed heavy on her mind.Whatshe had never given up her childhood pursuit to become an Olympic swimmer  Should she have followed her music dream to make it as a famous rock star adored by millions  How would things have panned outshe had never left the boyfriend who wanted to open a country pub with her The Midnight Library allows Nora to live out all of those possibilities and more ndash often with surprising outcomes. \"I have wanted to write about parallel lives for a long time,\" says Haig. \"I was just waiting for the right idea.\"Does he believe that parallel lives exist  \"I kind of do,\" he says. \"Increasingly science seems to back it up as well. I think there are all kinds of scientic reasons for some sort of parallel existence out there.\"Haig is warming to his theme. \"I have always been obsessed with it,\" he continues. \"Especially nowadays when we live in this age of constant comparison, which is exacerbated and accelerated by the internet and social media.\"People are continually comparing their lives to other peoples lives. And the lives they are comparing them to might not necessarily exist ndash they are just presented that way on social media.:Doug Johnstone on how spending time with a funeral director inspired his latest novels\"We are often doing hypothetical things where we are punishing ourselves for not having a certain le or body or perfect relationship. We are almost encouraged to feel bad about ourselves.\"The -year-old author, whose books include How To Stop Time and Notes On A Nervous Planet, says he wrote his new novel in the spirit of the  film Its A Wonderful Le, hoping to impart a message about \"acceptance and realising that often you have a lot more than you think\".Regret is a feeling Haig knows well. With the publication of his  memoir Reasons To Stay Alive, he laid bare the severe depression and spiralling anxiety that led to a breakdown and suicidal episode in his early twenties.Haig was  and living in Ibiza with his now we Andrea. Next month marks  years since the day when, feeling utterly powerless within the grip of such dark, debilitating thoughts that he was unable to see a future for himself, Haig stood on the edge of a clf preparing to jump.He wrote about his journey back to le in Reasons To Stay Alive. The book was meant to be a side project in between Haigs fiction works but struck such a chord that it became a UK No  bestseller and was published in  countries .It is impossible not to draw parallels ndash pardon the pun ndash between his experiences and those of Nora in The Midnight Library. When writing the book, Haig admits to ruminating on the many forks in his own path. If, like Nora, he had the chance, which ones would he revisit \"Often it has been mental health-related with me,\" he says. \"I had a bad time in my twenties where I was full of regrets. I was regretting the lestyle that led me to depression, I was regretting all the decisions I had made, and I was regretting having made the wrong career choices at that point.\"For many a year, when I was a struggling writer, I regretted being a writer. I got there in the end, but it wasnt an instant success story. There are lots of regrets, but I think Im much more philosophical about it all now.\"Haig believes he emerged from his breakdown better equipped to appreciate le. \"I wasnt a particularly happy child or teenager or young adult,\" he says. \"Then I was ill for most of my twenties and recovering into my early thirties.\"I still have the odd mental health dip now. My mental health is not in a perfect place ever ndash it is always on the scale somewhere ndash but I genuinely know more contentment, happiness and gratitude this side of my breakdown than I ever did when I was younger.\"Today, Haig lives in Brighton with Andrea and their two children. While many people knew his books before, there are those who have newly discovered Haig, thanks to his thoughtful words of reflection during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.He has become something of a figurehead for mental health. It is a mantle Haig isnt always comfortable withyet is unabashedly delighted to learn when his words do help others in pain.Haig is prolic on Twitter and Instagram, where he regularly gains attention for his astute observations on current affairs, mental health issues and a raft of sometimes poetic, mostly withering, jabs at Donald Trump .Describing his posts as brave, prompts a wry laugh. \"Brave stupid,\" says Haig. \"Sometimes on Twitter I forget that I have quite a few people following me now. I have always been a strange combination of sensitive but also opinionated. It is not like I am immune to criticism.\"As soon as you get a blue tick and a few thousand followers, its like people think, Oh well, they are fair game hellip I have learned to be a little bit more philosophical about it. There are people who, when they go on Twitter, switch from person to person, and it is just attack, attack, attack.\"A great tip to dealing with Twitter is before you take that one personal insult to heart, go look at their tweets to see what type of person they are. Nine times out of  it will make you feel better.\":Five must-read Scottish books headed for TV and filmThe author is as warm and affable to speak to voice-on-voiceas he comes across in his writing. Despite proffering sage words of wisdom, Haig admits he has struggled through lockdown as much as the next person.He is finding this current period particularly tricky. \"Because it is summer and Im such a person who lives for holidays, restaurants and getting away. I have realised that I dont have those little markers in my calendar of things to look forward to.\"However, Haig and his family have been finding other ways to have fun. \"Im a movie geek and so I try to get them [his children] into movies. We are going through all the James Bond movies. We are onto Roger Moore at the moment. Ive been explaining there is quite a bit of sexism in them.\"Also, we have an electric keyboard and are using an app to learn the piano and competing with each other on that. That is one of the things we have filled lockdown with.\"Basically, I try to get them excited about stuff because they teach me about Xbox-related things. Im literally the worlds worst player of video games. It is laughable how rubbish I am.\"Haig has another book in the pipeline. \"It is going to be called The Comfort Book,\" he says, adding that it will be \"less specically about mental health\" and \"more about how we can accept ourselves and imperfection, and feel comfortable with who we are.\"In the meantime, you can likely find him hanging out on social media. Although perhaps not forever. \"I do think probably, on balance, Twitter isnt a force for good,\" he muses. \"Its not really making society or the world any better.\"I do possibly dream or imagine a day where I will walk away from all social media.

They clasp hands to cross the road. The pensioner watches, wondering precisely what he is feeling. The realisation comes slowly.It is the tenth week of lockdown in the new calendar that pays no heed to the day of the week or the month. The pensioner looks at the boy swing on the end of his fatherrsquos arm. The old man, who lives alone, realises he has not touched another human being for  days.Unprecedented, he mutters to himself, using the term that has infected the language with the same facility with which coronavirus has changed the lives of everyone.His family is another county, barred from visiting him. His partner is self-isolating, outwith touching distance.Unprecedented. In his  years, he cannot have gone  days without human touch. Never. The realisation intrigues him rather than depresses him. It falls into one category of the serenity prayer that he says daily. It is one of things he must accept because he cannot change it.The summit offers a view down into Glasgow. There are the high flats of the northern escarpment. The city lies some miles in their shadow. He wonders how others are dealing with the crisis.He knows he is old. But there are those older. He knows he is alone.

I am the grateful old dodderer who stood on the hill and prayed with an unusual fervour and an even rarer selflessness that those less fortunate were being consoled by love in the time of coronavirus.IN moments of trial, and they came in a baleful consistency from March, Betty Satti would look at her husband and start to talk. It mattered not that he had died more than five years before and she was addressing a photograph.\"You do strange things when you are down,\" she says. \"I was married to him for  years. We were close. It is still hard.\"Lockdown made it harder. Betty, , walked out her front door on Wednesday for the first time since lockdown was imposed. She has the stock response of her generation to questions about how she came though such an ordeal. \"You just have to get on with it,\" she says.But how  \"I have my two sons. I couldnrsquot see them physically because I was shielding but I could talk to them. I had my friends.\"This help included Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation, a charity that has existed for  years but found its definitive moment in a time of greatest crisis. \"It is good to know somebody outside your family is thinking of you,\" Betty says. Those thoughts were matched by action.Unprecedented. The word is spoken by Richard Donald, chief executive of Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. There is no glibness to the expression. Rather, it is spoken in awe at what his organisation had faced and how it reacted.The simple figures can be succinctly put: in  days the charity delivered more than  food parcels and made  phone calls to vulnerable older adults.There was a motion commending the work in the Scottish Parliament last week. The thoughts of the recipients remain largely unheard. But the gratitude is immense. There were reports of pensioners who had not had a proper meal for three or four days. The charity moved urgently.\"We had to adapt and adapt quickly,\" says Mr Donald, who took over his role during the crisis and thus had a baptism not of fire but of some raging inferno. \"It was disarray at first,\" he says. \"How do you deal with something that has never happened before \"The charity has four main purposes: to give welfare advice, to provide a befriending service, to operate three day-care centres and to organise more than  clubs. Priorities changed quickly.\"People needed food parcels,\" says Mr Donald. \"Celtic FC Foundation got in touch and their intervention changed everything. They had the money to help is and they had the expertise too.\"The foundation is full of good people who immediately recognised the need. The food parcel programme was organised quickly and efficiently.\"The foundation, supported by the club, moved quickly to support those most in need, announcing pound, of support in April through its Football for Good Fund. That support grew through the crisis. Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation were immediately given pound, to support its work.With the initial crisis of hunger addressed, other more innovative plans took hold. More than  iPads have been distributed to those living on their own. \"We hope to raise money to provide more,\" says Mr Donald. He has he good grace to chuckle at the suggestion that is a novel way to invoke the mantra of ldquokeep taking the tablets but emphasises their importance.\"They do not only offer entertainment but a way to connect to the outside world,\" he says. A more traditional way is also employed to build a bridge between a vulnerable, shielding adult and the world beyond four walls. Volunteers call those in need.\"Some mornings I was on a downer,\" says Betty Satti. lsquoThen the phone would ring and it was Mitch, the volunteer who calls me. There would be a lsquoHow are you  Anything you are needing rsquo That lted me. It showed there were other people out there who cared. It was not just a brief call. He would talk for  minutes and I felt there was a genuine concern for what I was feeling and what I was finding dficult.\"My sons are great. But one lives in Essex and the other one lives in Fe and of course he could not travel to Glasgow. I was shielding anyway so he couldnrsquot see me. They call every day but for someone  to do so really lts you. You miss so much when you are locked down.\"I love going to the [GGG] clubs as I made so many friends there but when that became impossible it leaves a big gap in your le. The calls helped fill that as did the tablet. It sounds daft but the wee game of communal bingo on the tablet every Tuesday really raised the spirits. All that kept me going. When you are on you own, your mind wanders. You think: lsquoHow long is this going on rsquo The days become weeks, then months. It is dficult.rsquoThen it was over. \"I went out my front door on Wednesday,\" says Betty. \"My carer took me shopping and it was wonderful. I can only walk so far so she put the wheelchair in the car and we went to the shops early, when it was quiet. I was a bit hesitant.\"We take for granted being among people. But you miss it terribly, even just watching people walking about. You get depressedyou donrsquot see people. It was good to be back among people again.\"There is a pause then she adds: \"I am so grateful. I have a wonderful family but isnrsquot it great when people help you when they donrsquot have to or need to \"She adds: ldquoI have never know this. It is something I will never forget. There is pain in this but also the wonderful realisation that she was often alone but never forgotten.THE tone on the phone is as strong as the message it carries. ldquoI have come through a lot but never something quite as strange as this,rsquo says Nancy Sidwell, who approaches her th birthday with a sense of relief after the travails of the past five months.She was widowed in her thirties and had to bring up a young family of three. She is no stranger to hard times or moments that test the will or sap the physical strength of even the strongest but the coronavirus posed a dferent problem.\"It is hard to describe precisely,\" she says. \"But is a mental thing. The reality of not being able to touch anyone. Not being able to hug the ones you love. Not to have people in your house. It was a terrible sensation of being locked in not just locked down.\"She pays tribute to her family but is also grateful to Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. \"They helped provide a leline to the outside world,\" she says. \"I am used to being on my own and quite happy normally in my own company. But this was dferent. I found the tablet particularly helpful. It was a pleasant and useful distraction.\"Nancy lives in sheltered housing near the city centre and also grasped an opportunity to express her gratitude. \"I believe I am luckier than most,\" she says. \"In my block of flats there are  tenants and  of them have no one. No one. Now that is sad and it must be very dficult.\"She believes this is when Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation became not only helpful but essential. \"The people there are truly caring,\" she says. \"I tell you what I mean by this. There is a lot of talk about helping. But they made sure you were all right. They talked to you. They did something. Actions. They came along with the tablet, they called you.\"There is an uplt when you connect with the outside world. It comes when my grandchildren send me a text at night and when my children call me. Grandchildren are a godsend and you miss them dreadfully. We need that human touch.\"There is nothing that can replace that when you are distanced from those you love but those outside that circle can offer something . You need to know there is somebody out there who cares, not because you are a grandmother or a mother but simply because you are a human being.Nancy, too, found something of good to take from a period of her le that she admits caused her fear.ldquoI learned to appreciate what I had, she says. ldquoI learned to appreciate the love I received, whether it was from family, my circle of friends or from Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. It is important to know somebody out there cares for you.The conversation ended with Nancy offering her good wishes.

Three of those women, their identities concealed and their words spoken by actors, appear in the programme.The hour-long film presented by Kirsty Wark also includes a claim by SNP MP Kenny MacAskill that some evidence before the court was ldquoentirely .

They have greeted the YouGov poll indicating % support for Scottish independence with hubristic glee.The English examination results ndash afflicted by the social inequality which disfigured Scotlandrsquos ndash were greeted with a similar sense of conceit. ldquoSee: theirs were worse than ours. For a party committed to reducing educational inequality it doesnrsquot quite butter the parsnips. Such a response ignores the real source of anger at the moderation of Scottish pupilsrsquo examination predictions: that the inequalities and disadvantages spewed out by the process merely highlighted those which lie embedded in the educational system after  years of devolved government. Coronavirus merely exposed what has lain submerged for generations. It would be foolish to regard the sunny numbers in favour of independence as indicating popular absolution.The SNP ndash and by extension the cause of independence ndash have enjoyed a rewarding lockdown. Those residing outside the Holyrood bubble consume their politics via the early evening television and radio news programmes. For the last five months we have clung to these bulletins as theyrsquove updated us on the shting levels of threat to our mortal existence. They have been dominated by two people: the First Minister of Scotland and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Scotlandrsquos champion is universally seen to be confident, honest and empathetic the other chap: well ndash letrsquos be charitable here ndash signicantly less so.This is an important ergence at any time, but during a period of national emergency it becomes critical. When your le is in danger you attach less importance to more mundane matters such as education and the handling of the economy. In time, though, these will cease to be mundane and we will resume our close scrutiny of them.The state of emergency has also revealed how enfeebled the opposition to Ms Sturgeon and her administration has become. The Scottish Tories have been forced to jettison one leader and are currently being led by a part-timer who sees her future beyond the reach of democracy in an upper-class, private drinking club.The Labour Party in Scotland meanwhile is led by a poor chap who looks like he is about to cry every time he takes to his feet. Their support has been reduced to those who plough on for old timersquos sake. Between coronavirus and Europersquos most ineffective political opposition the SNP are governing Scotland free of scrutiny. In such circumstances % support for independence is the very least you should be expecting. Such circumstances wonrsquot prevail when a live referendum is unfolding. And Irsquom not convinced the party is anywhere near fit enough to fight one any time soon.On the three most pressing matters which will come to govern a second referendum the SNP donrsquot appear to have made any progress in the six years that have elapsed since the last one. There is no plan for joining the EU and no acknowledgement that such a process could take anything from two to five years. There is still no position on what currency an independent Scotland would use and no workings for settling the border issue with England. Indeed, the only body making the running on what an independent Scotland could look like ndash socially, culturally and economically ndash is Common Weal, the independence-leaning think-tank and advocacy body. But according to Stewart McDonald, the SNPrsquos spokesperson for defence at Westminster, Common Weal are to be regarded with disdain.In a bizarre tweet about the current upheaval in Belarus, Mr McDonald, who strives eagerly to be part of the SNPrsquos inner sanctum, said: ldquoIncredible events unfolding in Belarus: an uprising on the European continent, against an authoritarian Soviet dictator, led by women of courage and substance with their fellow citizens at their back. Common Weal types oddly mute. Quite what Common Weal was supposed to have said about a country . miles away is anyonersquos guess. Perhaps theyrsquoll issue a paper on it. Though Irsquom not sure that ponticating on another countryrsquos internal disputes is a good look for an organisation that resents interference in Scotlandrsquos own affairs.Another emerging problem for the SNP is the calibre of those in its Twitter wing who this week breathlessly announced their intentions to seek the partyrsquos nomination for Holyrood. That none have yet passed party vetting or consulted with local organisations has not dimmed their optimism, which seems to be founded purely on nods and winks at SNP headquarters. You donrsquot want to be unkind here, but each of them would melt in the heat of a y referendum campaign.They are also known among activists to have participated in the stitch-up preventing Joanna Cherry and her Westminster colleagues from ing to Holyrood. This has also caused deep resentment among ldquoCommon Weal types who will do most of the heavy lting at the next referendum.

Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally.

Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger.

The result has been shameless opportunism by the Unionist parties in proposing a vote of no confidence in John Swinney, when he did what any education secretary should do in protecting the value of the qualications awarded to candidates, as all candidates suffer when their awards are devalued. Had the SQA awarded a % pass rate based on teachersrsquo inflated estimates, he would have been castigated by these same parties. Tory MSP Jamie Greene even called for the resignation of Fiona Robertson for, effectively, not only following the instructions of her employer, the Education Secretary, but also of protecting the value of SQArsquos qualications as she was bound to do in her contract of employment.

Impartial news and journalism is important. The media that operates in Scotland, not least the BBC, have allowed themselves to be exploited as a conduit for attacks on the governing party in a way that does not happen in England. The public arenrsquot daft they can see this bias in the dferent emphasis placed, for example, on the education ldquoshambles on both sides of the Border. You can see it on any health issue, where the BBC in Scotland immediately escalates every story to a government ministerial responsibility. That never happens in England, in spite of repeated serious health scandals over decades.Why does this matter  It seems that repeated, and context-free, SNP-bad stories have inured many in the public into regarding much of the news as Unionist ldquodisinformation, and increasingly easy to ignore. An interesting project for universities to evaluate. The latest wheeze is to badge every spending commitment to Scotland with a Union flag asScots did not pay taxes.

It has nothing to do with the competence or otherwise of any political parties or inidual politicians but has everything to do with my perception of the competence of the Scottish nation. Against this, your regular anti-independence correspondents, including Dr Gerald Edwards and James Martincan offer nothing better than their view that Nicola Sturgeon may be brilliant but John Swinney is useless. How does that in any way relate to the democratic deficit which underpins the case for independence Willie Maclean, Milngavie.CONGRATULATIONS to your correspondent James Martin, for condensing into one short paragraph the most brilliant piece of doublespeak that Ive ever read in your Letters Pages. He refuses to comment on the suitability of the Education Secretary for the position while at the same time labelling Mr Swinney incapable of holding any government post.Gordon Evans, Burnside.GERALD Edwardsasks the question \"Is Scotland really a democracy any more \" As the no-confidence vote against John Swinney failed because it wasnt backed by the majority of MSPs, then clearly the answer is that Scotland is a democracy. The political make-up of the Scottish Parliament may not meet with Dr Edwardss approval, but he and all of Scotlands voters will be able to have their say next May and we will get the government we elect, unlike the situation at Westminster where we get not only the government England elects, but an unelected second chamber, where the already excessive numbers are due to be swollen still more by a Dame who is currently ensconced in Holyrood as a Tory MSP. Wheres the democracy in that Dr Edwards need have no fear that \"independence will be foisted upon us\". Scotland will regain her independence when Scotlands voters make that choice, and as there has been a \"signicant and material change of circumstance\" since  and as opinion polls increasingly indicate that voters want to make that choice, there should be no obstacles put in Scotlands way to prevent the choice being made. That would be a real travesty of democracy.Ruth Marr, Stirling.A NEW poll shows that four in  Scots, including a majority of SNP voters, do not want English tourists to be admitted to Scotland .

Those who strongly disagreed rose from % in April to % in June.A signicant number of children reported a sedentary lestyle and having less energy during lockdown \"that may have longer term impacts on physical activity, health and wellbeing\", the study said.More than one in five did not agree they had plenty of energy while over one in four did not agree they got enough exercise with around three in four saying computer games were helpful during lockdown.And most children did not like the home-learning model during lockdown and struggled to engage with just over half agreeing they often felt bored.John Dickie, director of Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland said the analysis showed that ministers had to urgently act for the future well-being of the nations children.ldquoThis survey highlights just how vital it is that policy makers and service providers listen to the voices of children as schools reopen and Scotland builds toward social renewal. We know from our work that children in families struggling on low incomes faced particular challenges engaging with school during lockdown, and that maintaining mental health was a real concern.\"Its own survey of  parents and  young people found that % of those in low-income families were missing at least one essential resource to support their childrens learning.Mr Dickie added: \"We need to listen to their experience and ensure lessons are learned so that all families have the resources they need to ensure their children can fully re-engage at school, with friends and in their communities.\"We must act now to prevent a generation of childhoods being blighted by lack of resources and worries over money.The Childrens Parliament study found a fall in the proportion of children who reported that learning at home made them feel good - from % in April to just % in April.Meanwhile nearly one in three said exams were a worry, and % said in June they worried about doing school work.The Childrens Parliament said thatany model of home or blended learning is to be used in the coming months in Scotland, the experience of children revealed in the study shows \"there is much work to be done to improve what is offered and how children are supported\".It added: \"Likewise, as childrento school on a full-time basis, there is a need for educators to acknowledge the childs experiences and think about what this means for theirto school-based learning.\"\"The survey results should inform considerations being given to how we mitigate the immediate concerns there are for children as a result of lockdown, and also inform the medium to longer term road out of lockdown - what we might consider as a period of recovery.\"The Herald revealed concerns about the education of Scotlands children amongst parents in June, as analysis of the experiences of over  parents revealed two thirds of parents complained their school was not providing online lessons during the coronavirus lockdown.Organised by the National Parent Forum of Scotland, the poll found that some % reported that their school had not provided online lessons, either live or recorded, for children while confined to the house.The revelations emerging from a poll of the parents found the biggest challenge faced by parents when supporting learning from home was balancing work with supporting the children , motivating kids to learnand not having enough resources and or support from the school .NPFS chairman Joanna Murphy said there had been a \"real inconsistency\" over educational delivery between local authorities and that there would be no excuse over a lack of planning when childrento school.The new study targets the feelings of children directly, and aims to give a national lockdown picture on a range of areas from home le, to learning in lockdown, to mental and physical health, family and peer relationships.It emphasised the need to consider the impact of lockdown on  to  year old girls, in particular.The analysis said they were more likely to feel bored during lockdown, to feel lonely and to say that that there are a lot of things that they worry about in le and and their own health.The analysis also showed a \"statistically signicant\" drop in how much children enjoyed being with their families during lockdown. In April and May % said they did enjoy being with their their parents and siblings, while this had dipped to % in June.Paul Carberry, Action for Childrens director for Scotland, said: ldquoIt is clear this pandemic has triggered a crisis for mums, dads and children on an unprecedented scale and this study chimes with many of the accounts our frontline staff are hearing from families on a daily basis.ldquoAs we begin to take steps out of lockdown, huge numbers of children will need extra support, over the coming months, which we are actively playing our part in. Despite this many parents are telling us they donrsquot know where  to turn for other support. As the immediate health crisis passes we now need to turn our attention to the scars coronavirus has left on families struggling with a whole new reality.\"One in four of Scotlands children are recognised as living in poverty, and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that almost a third of Scots incomes have reduced in lockdown, with half of affected renters worried about paying rent.The Childrens Parliament report said that children were not immune from understanding and worrying about the financial circumstances and pressures their families face.Across the three months over one in four reported that their parents carers worry about having enough money for their family, with younger children more likely to raise concern.There was also a statistically signicant decline in the proportion of children who said that while they were having a dficult time, they felt they would be okay, dropping from % in April to % in June.And nearly one in five reported a worry about not being able to play or be create, while around one in four did not agree that they think they make health choices in their le.The report noted: \"The quality of our relationships with others matters and as we emerge from lockdown and children can socialise again they take their lockdown experiences with them these need to be considered as we support children to re-engage with these important interpersonal relationships.Meanwhile a \"signicant number\" - over one in four - agreed that they felt lonely and there was a decline in the numbers of children who reported having \"fun things to do in their days\".And across the lockdown period children were less likely to \"try their hardest\" or feel pride in what they do.But there remained personal confidence across all children that they knew they were things they were good at, with over % agreeing.Although on the decline, around % agreed that they were proud of the things they can do.The Childrens Parliament was established in  to support the Scottish Government, local authorities and other public bodies to fulfill their legal obligations to promote and protect the human rights of everyone and fulfill their duty of care toward children.A Scottish Government spokesmanssaid: ldquoWe know lockdown is putting a strain on the mental health and wellbeing of many children and young people and have been working closely with all health boards to maintain the integrity and quality of Childrenrsquos Adolescent and Mental Health Servicesservices across Scotland throughout the COVID- pandemic.

In this time it has developed a reputation for innovative, effective and high-quality training strategies to meet industry needs.ldquoAST is EASA Part -approved to offer courses and examinations to meet the requirements of the Part  aircraft maintenance licence in most A and B categories, which includes piston and turbine aeroplanes, turbine helicopters, and avionics.AST had its roots in the Aeronautical Engineering College, founded by John Davenport Siddeley in , at Hamble Aerodrome in Hampshire.Siddeley was born in Cheshire in  and was a pioneer of the UK motor industry, manufacturing aero-engines and motor vehicles.But he decided there was a need for a better-equipped aeronautical school, where the RAF could offload its foreign pupils to receive civilian training.AST was formally opened by HRH The Duke of Gloucester on June ,  and he gave it the unofficial title of ldquoBritainrsquos Air University. Siddeley was knighted the following year.Initially, the courses offered at AST were aimed at pilots who had completed some basic training which included advanced piloting and blind flying courses.AST also developed a basic ground training device, an early flight simulator.The first woman to undergo flying training with AST was the legendary Mrs Victor Bruce who, in , went on to become the first woman to fly around the world alone, although she crossed the oceans on ships. Another famous student of AST was Amy Johnson, who completed the blind flying course in  and went onto become the first woman to fly solo from London to Australia.ASTrsquos expertise was valuable in the war effort, as it carried out many duties, including repairing spitfires and training over , RAF and allied personal in flying, aeronautical engineering and airfield control.It continued to grow after it moved to Perth in the s and trained students from airlines, including Aer Lingus, British United Airways, and Cambrian Airways.It also became involved on the big screen when AST instructor Captain Cyril Sweetman piloted the AST Hiller C helicopter used in the film From Russia with Love, chasing James Bond across the Scottish countryside.By the mid-s, AST claimed to be the largest civil aviation training organisation in the world.But in  it stopped training pilots for global economic reasons and the decision of the Civil Aviation Authorityto approve overseas flying schools which could offer training at a lower price.:Anger from Glasgow residents as military plane performs figure of eights above city in early hoursThe engineering school became a subsidiary of Perth College, University of the Highlands and Islandsthat year. AST continued to increase its aircraft resources including purchasing a Jetstream aircraft from Cranfield University.The existing hanger was not large enough for what was required so a larger hanger was leased from Perth Airport and a ceremony was held in November  with the then-Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lelong Learning, Fiona Hyslop MSP, officially opening the new hanger.Bob Sutherland added: ldquoWith a turnover of around pound million and a staff base of  personnel, AST and its students contribute enormously to the local community in terms of employment creation through spending on local goods and services.ldquoIt also takes part in school fairs, open days and is active in the Perth and Kinross aero clubs and STEM organisations, sharing knowledge withyoung people in the community. AST is a glowing example of a SME contributing not only to its local community but to the wider aviation environment, acting as advocates for safe air travel around the globe.AST also resumed flight training in  in collaboration with ACS Aviation which is also based at Perth Airport.In , AST was awarded the Queenrsquos Award for Enterprise in the category of international trade. It offers a wide range of training courses from foundation courses and approved courses to become a licensed engineer.:Last flypast for former flight training school For sale sign at Scone aerodromeIt also offers degrees in aircraft maintenance engineering and aircraft engineering in partnership with UHI. Training takes part at both Perth Airport and UHI at Perth College.Perth Airport also changed hands s when it was purchased by the Morris Leslie Group in . While there are no commercial flights operating from the airport, it is Scotlandrsquos main airport for general aviation.As well as AST, there are other organisations which operate from the airport, including the Scottish Aero Club which was established in  near Glasgow and relocated to Perth Airport in  ndash it is Scotlandrsquos largest flying club.Meanwhile, ACS Flight Training was formed in  and offers flight training courses.Alba Airsports offers training in gyro and microlight flying."},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-ordered-tailors-stop-making-jacket-finding-buttons-werent-scotland","story":"And now it can be revealed that Prince Charles really does give more than two buttons about supporting the countryrsquos craftspeople.For he has insisted that even the tiniest part of his iconic Scottish attire must be home-sourced ndash after the heir to the throne rejected stag horn buttons from Austria for his kilt jacket and matching waistcoat.Instead, they had to be Scottish, he said.After a hunt, John Sugden, owner of Campbellrsquos of Beauly ndash which made the striking attire ndash managed to find good Scottish stag buttons to sow on to the stunning khaki green, faint houndstooth pattern tweed, which has an orange window pane check.ldquoThe prince had chosen the tweed himself. It just happened by chance to be the cloth on my fatherrsquos old briefcase and the prince said lsquothatrsquos just what Irsquom looking for,rsquo said Sugden, who has just been announced as a textiles programme ambassador for The Princersquos Foundation.ldquoThe majority of stag horn buttons come from Austria. The prince is very open and both fastidious and passionate about craft. So he insisted that the buttons had to be Scottish stag horn. He does care about the detail. It really matters to him that he promotes British craftsndash even with the smallest of things.ldquoWe were actually both a little concerned that it would be the Austrian buttons that went on the jacket because we couldnrsquot find an alternative at the time. But the princersquos fastidious nature drove us to look into sourcing Highland stag and we went to great s to do so. Now we have a gamekeeper who makes them for us.ldquoWhy do we have to ship stag horn buttons from Austria at all that extra cost  It does not make sense. It also fits in with the princersquos philosophy about carbon footprint with the distance goods unnecessarily travel to market.The cost of the jacket and waistcoat has not been revealed, but a similar bespoke pair of the garments made by Campbellrsquos retails at around pound,.Sugden said the princersquos insistence on Scottish stag horn buttons was one important example of why it was important to promote British crafts.Through his role as an ambassador, he will use his expertise of working in the textiles industry to support the princersquos charity in its vision, mission and strategy.He is also co-chair with Patrick Grant ndash from the BBCrsquos The Great British Sewing Bee ndash of the Dumfries House textiles school in Ayrshire.The Princersquos Foundationrsquos Future Textiles programme aims to address a skills gap within the UK textiles industry by offering practical workshops and advanced training courses to school pupils, teachers and those looking to gain employment in the industry. Many of these courses are delivered in the estatersquos textile training entre, located in the old sawmill at Dumfries House where the foundation is based.Programmes range from one-day workshops for school pupils to in-depth training programmes producing garments for the luxury fashion market. Supporters of the programme including major retailers and brands such as Yoox, Net-a-Porter, Alexander McQueen and Christopher Kane.Campbellrsquos, which holds a royal warrant from the Queen, also supplies the RoyalHousehold and makes all the tweed outfits for Balmoral Estate.Over the years, the company has also supplied the Queen Mother and the Duke of Windsor. Sugden is too discreet to name other famous clients but admitted: ldquoI often see our clothes being worn by people gracing the pages of Hello, Country Le, and Harperrsquos Bazaar.ldquoI saw the movement towards craft coming. I try to push and promote British-made products. We use British cloth every time we can. We have some of the finest fabrics in the world. Fast fashion will have a downward spiral.Sugden has worked with the prince for five years. ldquoI have always had a passion for clothing and for making things in Britain ndash and so does the prince, he said.People are starting to care more about provenance. But I was struck by the lack of skills in the industry that were in danger of dying out and that it was imperative to build them up.ldquoThe problem is not really in design ndash lots of people want to be designers ndash but there is a worrying age gap in making things in such skills as cutting, tailoring and working as seamstresses. If the demand is coming back we need to make young people feel valued in the industry again.ldquoWe need people to work on the shop floor of the mills again ndash it is not like the days of Jerusalem and dark satanic mills. They are modern working spaces. A weaving job is a skilled job. We all canrsquot be designers. We have to enthuse people to be involved in the whole process. Even the skills to darn socks are being lost.Sugden recognised that the fashion industry had to do more to cut down on its environmental damage from such things as microfibres polluting the ocean.He said: ldquoWe need to drive down the use of plastic in the industry. I know its a great passion of his highness as well to get its usage down. Itrsquos a huge challenge for the fashion industry, but in the UK we are specialists in natural fibres. I would rather buy natural fibres ndash why do we need polyester  Itrsquos just the price. You have to change the psyche of young people.ldquoWhat the prince is doing at Dumfries House is amazing and leading the way in saving our traditional crafts. It is offering youngsters the opportunity and pathway to be part of the future of Britainrsquos textile industry. Without his initiative and raising awareness there is a real danger we could lose these old skills.It is not the first time the prince has publicly backed buying British. During a visit in  to the Isle of Harris distillery in the Outer Hebrides, Charles, known as Lord of the Isles, asked why its pound gin drinking glasses were made in Poland.The Isle of Harris distilleryrsquos gin is contained in distinctive bottles made in Yorkshire by specialist manufacturer Stolzle Glass Group. ldquoThey couldnrsquot do both  asked the prince. It was explained to the prince that they could not.Polish-born Peter Kwasniewski, the Tarbert-based distilleryrsquos shop manager, said afterwards:We tried in the UK to find a handmade glass that could match the pattern of our bottles. But we couldnrsquot find anybody. We also tried in France but with the same result. I knew of a manufacture in southern Poland who were able to do it."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-letters-readers-talking-week","story":"He has succeeded in ramping up grade inflation, leaving employers and higher institutions wondering whether some of the results are worth the paper they are written on.He has quietened the public outrage and won over the -year-olds to his side, making it likely that they will vote for the SNP in next years election.He has undermined the position of the SQA as the quality control agency which lends credibility to the certicates issued in its nameInstead of going for a compromise to maintain at least a semblance of credibility for this years exam results, he has just opened the floodgates to certicates on demand.Even those who have benefited from Mr Swinneys largesse in this matter must know in their heart of hearts that this was not the correct way to deal with this crisis even in the exceptional circumstances created by Covid-.Mr Swinney has also preserved his position with this decision by keeping the Greens onside when it came to the vote of no confidence.Really, he should do the decent and honourable thing by resigning.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.BBC  Scotland recently broadcast an excellent Disclosure documentary about the Scottish Covid care home scandal, using actors to deliver testaments from actual workers and families too afraid to speak out.It needs to do the same on education, not just about exam results, but the wider problems in Scottish education.It should cover pupil behaviour and the failure of Curriculum for Excellence, two major reasons for the exodus of experienced teachers, and key factors in declining standards and attainment.

Thats a big TV audience these days for an organisation whose role is to inform and educate.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.ROSS IN THELINE OF FIREDOUGLAS Ross has said he is to hang up his linesman flaghe is to be First Minister, but he will continue to be a linesman while leader of the Scottish Tories. I donrsquot think that he has really thought this through, though.Aside from the ridiculous assertion that he will one day be First Minister, has he not realised that continuing to run the line at Scottish football matches would mean that the new leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party would, in fact, be facing the general public This is something that no Conservative leader does any more, that isthey ever did. Running the line at football matches was previously okay for him because he was a complete and utter nonentity unknown completely to the general and footballing public, but it will not be the case now.I now look forward to his public footballing appearances in the former industrial heartlands of Central Scotland decimated by the very people he venerates. However, fair play to himhe does turn out and I look forward to see his appearances at such places as Motherwell, Falkirk and Dundee. Perhaps he will hold public question and answer sessions after the matches.What he will do, though, is have football chairmen up and down the country rubbing their hands in anticipation of adding a few thousand supporters on to their gates every week. When the wider Yes movement and the grass roots football fans realise that he will continue to run the line at Scottish football matches and with thousands deprived of Yes marches to go on, attendance at Douglas Ross football matches could become a new raison drsquoecirctre for lots of Scots he could possibly single-handedly save Scottish football, filling stadiums week in week out.However much as it would be entertaining to see him continue as a football linesman I fear his bosses in London will put a block on the continuation of his refereeing career. He could, of course, ask the Scottish footballing authorities to install outdoor fridges along the touchlines thus allowing him to continue his career.Andrew J Beck, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.A QUESTION for an SNP MP to ask at Prime Ministers Questions: \"On behalf of those too young to vote last time, what measures does the UK PMs chief adviser, Baron Cummings of Barnard Castle, recommend to ensure that Vlad the Bad does not interfere with the  Holyrood election \" Im trying to explore the limits of a UK PMs power. He can make the English wear masks in supermarkets , but not make the Scots believe in Brexit. It takes Nicola Sturgeon to lock down Aberdeen. He cant get the French to help with the rubber dinghy immigration problem because no one beyond the Channel takes him seriously.

More than , have been rescued from the Channel this year. Asylum seekers should claim sanctuary in the first \"safe haven\" they enter in Europe. They do not and are therefore illegal immigrants. They are predominantly young men who will get accommodation, food and other benefits. Britain should tell France that unless they stop the immigrant flow we will ban all imports from France and suggest that British holidaymakers avoid France.The SNPs shadow minister for immigration Stuart McDonald said the rhetoric around immigration is \"toxic\" and based on \"inherent xenophobia\". Will he take some of these failed immigrants into his home Clark Cross, Linlithgow.THE lachrymal ducts of our First Minister must be working overtime at the moment as we are told she was \"in tears\" at the recent misbehaviour of a few of the Aberdeen team who had visited a pub, which activity ndash according to Nicola Sturgeon ndash \"put lives at risk \" and was even \"a matter of le and death\".Her tears, we are told, turned to fury at the reckless, uncaring attitude of these men who, by their actions, had put the wellbeing of us all at risk. Our First Minister then revealed how distraught she waswhen she reflected on the fate of thousands of our old folk who had contracted Covid- ndash then died in care homes.Heres my question: was Ms Sturgeon \"in tears\" or \"furious\" on learning ndash as all of Britain has in the last few days ndash that thousands of illegal migrants asylum-seekers are flooding into our country, having crossed the English Channel in dinghies, enabled and assisted on the last stage of the crossing by our Border Force, which does notthem to France but provides the migrants with all they need in terms of information advice to make a claim for asylum . Is she \"furious\" ndash as many Scots are ndash when she realises that these migrants have come through countriesravaged by Covid - yet are being accepted into our country with little or no check on them When shes not sobbing does our First Minister ever experience guilt or shame at having sent out her cry for \"more immigrants\" and calling anyone who expressed concern at this folly \"racist\" I doubt it. Her tear ducts may be working ndash but her conscience isnt. And yet, she gets kudos and acclaim from sections of the media for her \"competent\" and \"robust\" handling of the Covid crisis.Eight football players made her cry. What is her reaction to the news that thousands of people ndash unchecked, untraced, uncontacted, unknown ndash are entering our country  She must realise it makes a mockery of all the social distancing face-covering quarantine instructions.John McInnes, Glasgow.LEVEL WITH UShellipSO-CALLED climate change hits the news almost weekly, and in the last week there has been the claim that enough ice in Antarctica has melted to fill the Grand Canyon, with implications for sea level rise.In his UN climate speech in  President Obama said that ldquorising sea levels threaten every coast line.

This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It brings together erse partners to develop the tools, processes and business models that mean rural and poorly connected communities can rapidly establish next generation and G connectivity for local benefit.Currently, only  per cent of the UK is being served by all four UK mobile network operators and there are still , homes and businesses that don’t receive adequate broadband service as investment predominantly focuses on areas with higher population density.To date, mobile connectivity in the UK has relied on mobile network operators to purchase exclusive licences for access to spectrum and they design, build, own, and operate their own networks.  In , Ofcom changed its policy on spectrum sharing to develop a more open and accessible spectrum market one that acts as a  for innovation, reducing the cost of access to high-quality spectrum in regional areas and opening opportunities for new endeavours to address rural connectivity.G New Thinking will help by providing a practical how-to guide for rural communities looking to capitalise on this opportunity and invest in local connectivity. By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide. All of this is built on the learnings from trials undertaken as part of G RuralFirst, a Cisco-led DCMS G Trials and Testbed programme.Chief Executive, Cisco UK  Ireland, David Meads, said: “Our findings with G RuralFirst revealed that over a ten-year period, the UK’s rural economy could grow by an additional £ bngood quality G services were accessible.“We believe that by taking advantage of neutral hosting technologies, fixed wireless access and spectrum sharing, we will be able to allow third parties – including local businesses and communities – to build and own radio infrastructure, as well as work with mobile network operators to reduce costs and make rural coverage commercially sustainable.”Minister for Digital Infrastructure, Matt Warman, said: #We are making sure the UK#s rural communities aren’t left behind in the digital age and are investing record amounts to improve connectivity in the least connected parts of the country.“G New Thinking is part of our £ million programme to help the countryside capitalise on new ways of using next generation G technology and I look forward to seeing how rural communities will benefit.#The project is expected to go live later in  and to conclude in .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Share away, or tell yerhellipPosted by Scottish club gigs ndash relived onThursday, July , Speaking to the PA news agency ahead of the bookrsquos release, he said: ldquoAnyone whorsquos seen it so far is excited and Irsquove had a lot of interest, even just since the recent posts on social media, which obviously is such a big part of promoting something like this.ldquoI knew early on it was going to be good ndash I could tell from what I was getting ndash but what you canrsquot do is fling out all your best photos to show people because once theyrsquore out theyrsquore out. The freshness is really important.ldquoPeople are emailing from all over the globe wanting copies and Irsquom quite amazed because obviously itrsquos gigs in Scotland, but not just Scottish bands, so there is that broader appeal.ldquoYou hope for that but I thought it would have taken time to filter out. I was expecting that once I had a copy in hand then itrsquos easier for folk to visualise but I think itrsquos a combination of factors.ldquoI think the lockdown has meant that folk are at home more and on their computers more, theyrsquore not spending so much money ndashtheyrsquove got any money at all and not going out socialising and doing the usual things ndash so they are buying music books and other things online.ldquoPeople have been going through the shoeboxes and digging out old photos and posting memories but to be quite honest Irsquom really happy with the material Irsquove got. vw,vw,px, px\"David Bowie at the Glasgow Apollo in  Mr Brickley focused on the  to  era not just because of his own love of the music from that period but also the availability of photographs from gigs.Bands and artists featured in the book include David Bowie, The Clash, Motorhead, Ultravox and the Sex Pistols ndash who only made one appearance in Scotland ndash with  venues ranging far and wide.As well as covering musicians, the book includes photographs of the fans ndash highlighting the hair and fashion trends of the years ndash with , pictures, tickets, posters and autographs.The book also includes a foreword by Ian Rankin as well as photographs from Harry Papadopoulos and Chalkie Davies.Despite restrictions on venues as a result of Covid-, Mr Brickley still hopes to have launch events to celebrate the bookrsquos publication, with information to be posted on the Scottish clubs gigs ndash relived social media channels. vw,vw,px, px\"The Clash performing at Dunfermline Kinema in  As well as having online events, he added: ldquoI have got stuff arranged ndash obviously it has been dficult to organise. We have got two willing venues that have been fantastic.ldquoItrsquoll sort of be as demand requires, obviously eventsyou can have them are all seated and table service and you canrsquot even play music because last Friday they changed the regulations.ldquoI and everyone  will just have to go with the flow and be responsible and thatrsquos fine.ldquoI would like to take it around the country but it depends on how it goes in the cities. Horses for courses a wee bit. But theyrsquore relatively straightforward to arrange.When askedhe had enough material for a follow-up, Mr Brickley told PA: ldquoSomebody I know has rustled up some fantastic pictures, hersquod already given me stuff for this book but he knew he had more, so people are saying lsquoyoursquove got to do a secondrsquo.ldquoThat would be really nice but Irsquom not getting ahead of myself.copy -.

Americans should not have to choose between their health and their vote, she wrote.Earlier on Sunday, Democrats demanded that leaders of the Postal Service testy at an emergency oversight hearing on August  about mail delays.The House Oversight and Reform Committee said it wanted to hear from new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and from the chair of the Postal Service board of governors, Robert Duncan.The agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment about whether the two men would appear before the House committee.But it said on Sunday it would stop removing its distinctive blue mailboxes through mid-November, following complaints from customers and members of Congress that the collection boxes were being taken away.ldquoGiven the recent customer concerns the Postal Service will postpone removing boxes for a period of  days while we evaluate our customersrsquo concerns, said Postal Service spokeswoman Kimberly Frum. vw,vw,px, px\"Donald Trump, seen at the White House with son Barron on Sunday, is fighting against postal voting in Novemberrsquos election Mr DeJoy, a major Republican donor and ally of the president who took control of the agency in June, has pledged to modernise the money-losing agency to make it more efficient. He has eliminated most overtime for postal workers, imposed restrictions on transportation, and reduced of the quantity and use of mail-processing equipment.ldquoThe postmaster general and top Postal Service leadership must answer to the Congress and the American people as to why they are pushing these dangerous new policies that threaten to silence the voices of millions, just months before the election, congressional Democrats said in a statement announcing the hearing.Mr Trump said last week he was blocking a  billion dollaremergency injection sought by the Postal Service, as well as a Democratic proposal to provide . billion dollarsin additional election money to the states. vw,vw,px, px\"Nancy Pelosi is trying to move to block Donald Trumprsquos battle against mail-in voting The Republican president worries that mail-in voting could cost him reelection. The money for the post office is intended to help with processing an expected surge of mail-in ballots. Both funding requests have been tied up in congressional negotiations over a new coronavirus relief package.ldquoWhat you are witnessing is a president of the United States who is doing everything he can to suppress the vote, make it harder for people to engage in mail-in balloting at a time when people will be putting their lives on the line by having to go out to a polling station and vote, said Senator Bernie Sanders.Mr Trump acknowledged in a Fox Business interview on Thursday that he is starving the agency of money to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots.Funding a cash-strapped Postal Service has quickly turned into a top campaign issue as Mr Trump presses his unsupported claim that increased mail-in voting will undermine the credibility of the election and Democrats push back.Mr Trump, who spent the weekend at his New Jersey golf club, derided universal mail-in voting as a ldquoscam and defended Mr DeJoy as the right person to ldquostreamline the post office and make it great again.copy -.

most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned

that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Three Northern Ireland school principals on the controversy surrounding a covid-hit results day.Amanda McNamee, principal of Lagan College: #We#re dismayed to see our young people unsure of future pathways#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmanda McNamee FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAmanda McNameeThis year, our school community, like all others, has experienced unprecedented levels of change and disruption since March , but throughout the Covid- pandemic, we have been extremely proud of how our Sixth Form students have coped with the situation that the education system found itself in.Students had their learning disrupted, were denied the opportunity to sit examinations and experienced serious uncertainty about their future, but throughout it all they held an unwavering confidence that their teachers, who knew their learning best, would not let them down.As a centre of learning, Lagan College agrees that statistical modelling has its place in a normal given year.However, we believe more passionately that a teacher#s knowledge of their student#s learning, continuous assessment and potential supersedes this and this has been anything but a normal school year.So, our school community feels extremely disheartened and disappointed that some of our students believe that the education system has let them down.This year, we have recorded a signicant disparity between teacher centre assessed gradesand the final grades awarded by the Northern Ireland examination board.Some % of all A-level grades awarded were reduced, % of AS-level grades awarded were reduced.Unfortunately, until we receive more information and transparency about the awarding process used for an inidual learner, we do not feel confident that grades awarded to every student were a fair reflection of their work to date and potentialthey had been able to sit examinations.We were dismayed to see some of our students upset and disarmed yesterday and uncertain of their onward pathways. However, teachers were on hand to reassure our young people and their families that all of this was simply beyond their control.Let#s now all redouble our efforts in the education system to reflect upon yesterday#s events and ensure that the wellbeing of our young people is not unnecessarily and further impacted upon this year.Alan Hutchinson, principal of Glastry College, Newtownards: #Students# hopes dashed by farce and systemic discrimination#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlan Hutchinson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlan HutchinsonYesterday Glastry College students arrived to collect results full of hope for their future many excited about fulfilling their dreams by accessing higher education courses that will shape their lives and the lives of their families for decades to come. Instead, they were graced with what, at best, can be described as a farce and at worst systemic discrimination.At A-level % of our candidates were downgraded in at least one subject, while % of all Centre Assessed Grades were adjusted downwards.The statistical modelling used by CCEA appears to have taken no account of any work completed, or progress made by students in the seven months they studied during this academic year up until lockdown.Over the last five years our internal tracking data has indicated that we have predicted the overall A-level outcome for students to within -% either way.However, based upon the grades awarded by the examining body this year, our predictions appear to be out by an incredulous %!The question arises, do we trust and value the expert judgment of teaching professionals who have many years# experience, know the students as iniduals and have access to multiple sources of reliable assessment and tracking data, or data scientists who are more interested in decidedly limited and dubious data than the devastation caused to students, parents and teachers Statistics aside, we are dealing here with young people, with human beings, all of whom have hopes and aspirations, many of which are now dashed on a system they were promised would not disadvantage them.Moreover, the policy to go into lockdown appears to have dealt a signicant blow to those deemed to be least in need of the protection afforded by it.On top of this, we must acknowledge the trauma this cohort of pupils has already suffered.The opportunity to showcase their ability, skills, and knowledge acquired and developed over the last seven years was stolen.Their school career abruptly ended with no time for farewells or celebrations.Further anxiety was added by the enforced separation from their peers due to lockdown.Now, instead of aiding and supporting these pupils, CCEA has compounded this emotional distress, predominantly it seems, in non-selective schools by permitting what is nothing short of an incongruous travesty.I sincerely hope that immediate and rectying action is taken in the interests of all the young people unjustly penalised this year by a very flawed system.Gary Kelly, principal of St Kevin#s College, Lisnaskea: #My excitement turned to upset when I saw the pupils# grades#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGary Kelly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGary KellyWith over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, yesterday was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils# grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin#s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year#s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no - approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA exam board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly.It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out -ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school, and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year.But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils# grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board.Pupils are saying you know me Sir or Miss - I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results.They say: I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write - what does this say about me. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today - normally we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it#s more like  to .I don#t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both hear and across the whole of Northern Ireland.

teachers’ prediction.The SDLP is seeking the support of other MLAs to secure the  signatures required to force the recall of the Assembly from summer recess.The education committee did sit during recess to question Mr Weir on Friday.During the y hearing, chairman Chris Lyttle urged the minister to intervene and ensure pupils were awarded A-level grades based on either their AS-level attainment or the estimated grade assessed by their teacher.“These are unprecedented times,” said the Alliance MLA.Mr Lyttle said he was aware of a school that had seen its A*-C attainment rate fall from % last year to % under the calculation model.He said the minister was “increasingly isolated” in refusing to use the teacher assessments to allocate the grades.Mr Weir responded by insisting thatteacher predictions were used without standardisation, the results would not have “any level of credibility” because the results would be so much higher than those achieved in previous years.He said that approach would also be unfair on pupils, as some teachers would have been “generous” in estimating grades while others had been “tough” on their students.“There would be no equality whatsoever,” said

acknowledged that the system for calculating A-level results “did not work for everyone”.He said there was no way of creating a perfect replacement for sitting the exams which were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.“We were looking to create what was a least-worst solution,” said the minister.Mr Weir highlighted that a fast-tracked appeals process has been established for those students who believe they have been treated unfairly.The standardisation model was developed by Northern Ireland exam body the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment .CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within their class.The exams body then used other data to standardise the results.For A-levels, the data included pupils’ AS-level results, making adjustments for those who had applied to take resits.For AS results, the pupils’ GCSE results were also used, as was the performance by their school over the previous three years.Today, SDLP have tabled a petition to recall the Assembly, to urgently address the crisis over exam grading.

Mr O#Dowd said: “Sinn Fein had hoped to see signicant movement from the Education Minister over the weekend to address the exam grading crisis.I am confident that themotion will attract the necessary support to ensure the Assembly is recalled and will properly focus on the need for urgent action from the Education Minister to sort out this crisis.MLAs from the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party have said they will back the move while TUV leader Jim Allister has also pledged his support.Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit is supporting the petition. I have added my name to the recall petition for the Assembly to be reconvened in light of the disastrous handling of A-Level results for students, he said, posting on Twitter on Sunday evening.DUP MP Sammy Wilson dismissed the petition as political opportunism but it#s expected the potential recall may also coincide with a planned protest by students at Stormont this week.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSammy Wilson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSammy WilsonA group of young activists has called on students, teachers, principals and politicians to gather outside parliament buildings on Tuesday to demand grades are reassessed.Cormac Savage, President of the Secondary Students# Union of Northern Ireland, said: We plan to be seen and be heard.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge.

The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen.

In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

Since nobody is happy with the system the planners could argue that they must have got the balance right, but a report into planning in Northern Ireland recently published by Queen’s University and Cardf University found that roughly % of people using the system believe that it does not look after the public interest, and that only % of citizens using the system feel that their views are taken into account — so something is very wrong. One might start by asking why we have planning at all.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Marcus Patton is an artist and architectWhen the modern planning system was introduced after the war in  its main priority was to stimulate redevelopment of areas that had been damaged by bombing, and to build an infrastructure that would revive the economy. In England that was counterbalanced by the introduction of the system of listed buildings and recognition that there should be a balance between development and the protection of amenity.In Northern Ireland we got the development bit, but listed buildings were not provided for until , and the preliminary survey of our historic buildings was not completed till around . In the meantime we had the Troubles and many of our buildings were damaged or demolished before they could even be considered for listing. With that on top of the usual depredations of developers and roads engineers what has been left is particularly precious to us. It could be argued that in the present day, far from stimulating development, the planning system should be there primarily to protect our environment and to deal with climate change. Developers will always want to develop, andthey are prevented from developing one area they will move to another. If planners stick to their guns in protecting conservation areas and listed buildings, developers will turn their attentions to less salubrious areas where their investment could be genuinely beneficial. Unfortunately we have a system which clogs up development by trying to tweak it instead of refusing it outright when it is inappropriate and yet which eventually approves some % of applications. So essentially we have a bureaucratic system which ultimately rubber stamps almost everything put in front of it. On the rare occasions when an application is refused the applicant can withdraw it and try again with some modications, or he can appeal to the Planning Appeals Commission, where over % of appeals are successful and the planners are overruled. One curiosity of the planning system is that while the developer has this right of appeal, a person living beside the development - who it might be argued is more signicantly affectedby it than the developer is — has no such right. While you wouldn’t want the planning system to be clogged up with vexatious appeals about minor alterations, the householder who finds a tower block going up at the end of his street has a genuine grievance — and it is one that will be shared by many others. Third party right of appeal — as this redress is called — exists in many parts of Europe, including Ireland, but not in the UK whose systems we generally follow. It seems a natural balance of legal rights to give the people affected the same rights as the perpetrator, particularly when the appeal is supported by environmental groups acting purely in the public interest. Planning often came in for criticism when it was carried out by the centralised DoE with a series of codes and standards that were applied unormly across the province. But we now have a dozen planning authorities, with each council devising its own iation on planning codes. Add to that the role of councillors who may be lobbied by developers, and council officers who are anxious to increase potential rates income and attract businesses to their area, and we have a recipe for bargain-basement planning. There are of course councillors who support their constituents in trying to protect the environment, but too often they are a small minority. The recent case ofthe Westminster housing secretary Robert Jenrick overruling a local council to grant permission for a multi-million pound scheme by a Tory donor shows how easily even a government minister can be persuaded to make decisions that favour wealthy developers rather than protect the interest of people living in an area..We need a planning system that protects the environment, is not afraid to refuse unsuitable applications, and enforces breaches of planning law promptly and fearlessly. If it is a toothless bureaucracy then there is very little point in having it. If you have a planning system — and most people would agree that there should be one — it must be seen to be fair and to act in the public interest. It is not easy, but our planners should not allow the degradation of our built or natural heritages, should not pander to developers, and should valiantly seek to make Northern Ireland a better place in which to live and work. • Marcus Patton is an artist and architect——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
