I asked the Bar Council for an indication of whether I might be at risk of sanction.\u0027He said the Bar Council \u0027doesn\u0027t make the rules but it is supposed to be the representative body, So, we might hope it takes proactive steps to address this issue in the interests of its black members\u0027.  When a fellow Twitter user suggested Mr Etienne \u0027tie back\u0027 his hair, he replied: \u0027Afro doesn\u0027t just \u0027tie back\u0027. \u0027Tie it down, maybe. But I object to restraining my hair as a condition of going to work.\u0027 Sam Mercer, head of equality at the Bar Council, told the Times that the organisation was now \u0027absolutely\u0027 prepared to \u0027take soundings\u0027 on the issue. The white wigs worn by barristers, known as perukes, are seen by some as a symbol of authority, and offer a level of anonymity to the QCs wearing them. They are no longer worn in most court hearings in England and Wales, but they are mandatory in the crown court, certain civil hearings and the High Court and Court of Appeal.  But Mr Thomas, one of the most high profile black barristers in the country, branded them \u0027nonsense\u0027 and said they should be scrapped entirely.He told the Times: \u0027Wigs are 17th century male fashion, to have them in the 21st century is nonsense.\u0027   Peter Herbert, a former part-time judge and barrister, added that he never wore a traditional wig or forced advocates appearing before him wear them.\u0027The sky didn\u0027t fall in, juries were happy, barristers did not get recognised by criminals and justice was still done,\u0027 he said.Alphege Bell, who was the first ever barrister to appear in court with dreadlocks, suggested there should be a law that recognises the impact wearing the wigs can have on black barristers. He cited the Create a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair Act, which was passed in California in 2019 to outlaw race-related hairstyle discrimination.\u0027It\u0027s about seeing how processes and practices in the workplace have an adverse effect on those with non-traditional hairstyles, and giving them protection and comfort, so they can feel proud and confident that they won\u0027t be subjected to adverse treatment because of the appearance of their hair,\u0027 he said.Mr Bell added that if the courts want people from erse backgrounds to become barristers, \u0027should we make adjustments to ensure that our processes and tradition don\u0027t adversely affect them?\u0027In an interview with the Times last year, he said being a barrister \u0027shouldn\u0027t be about how your hair falls.\u0027 He said: \u0027We shouldn\u0027t live in fear because our hair isn\u0027t a certain way. \u0027This job should be about intellectual excellence and ability it shouldn\u0027t be about how your hair falls. \u0027The configuration of your hair doesn\u0027t add to the strength of your argument.\u0027 Meanwhile family law barrister Yaa Dankwa Ampadu-Sackey,  who wears her hair in braids, tweeted that the traditional wigs were \u0027not always compatible\u0027 with her hairstyle and could make her feel uncomfortable, potentially affecting her performance in court.Another female barrister, using the Twitter name KingTriiciia, posted: \u0027Until we address the deeply rooted anti-blackness at the Bar, nothing will change. \u0027All the talks, inclusive and equality projects mean nothing when the root is rotten.\u0027    Ban culturally insensitive wigs, says black barrister with afro hairstyle | News | The TimesWhy Do Barristers Wear Wigs in the UK? | The Lawyer Portal‘Law should be about intellectual ability, not how your hair falls’ | Law | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"The scramble replace Cressida Dick","story":"Share this articleTackle poverty and inequality to reduce crime, says police chief | Police | The Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ae16e29a96634247446ac210a68f70c1ec5e7a3/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eb1ccf13403e64f62f96ea80a0dae6b6","title":"uk gdp december 2021 omicron recovery stock markets ftse inflation fed business live","story":"As this chart shows: Overall, the UK is in the ‘middle of the pack’ in the race to recover from the pandemic, says Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. But it’s important to put that into a little bit of context, Morgan added: It warned that the balance of risks had tipped towards higher inflation, citing higher energy prices and ‘geopolitical events’: “After a tough Christmas, Omicron has continued to bite, and this has been a weak start to the year,” said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport.  Yet 2021 can’t be seen in isolation. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are correct when they say the UK had the fastest growth in the G7 last year, yet what they normally omit to add is that it came after the UK had the biggest contraction of any G7 nation a year earlier. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC UK, agrees.  He says the UK’s position is “less flattering” when you compare its level of output since the pandemic began to its G7 peers, with the US and France having grown more over the same period.

Impressive stuff. Meanwhile, Man City aren’t quite setting the world alight having scored only seven goals in their last five Premier League starts although, to be fair, Pep Guardiola’s leaders have taken 13 points out of 15 across those matches. Here’s Smith: “I am not going to anger Pep again by suggesting they are the best team in the world, but they are certainly up there. They are a very good team, littered with stars all over the place and, whatever team they put out, you know it is going to be a challenge. “But there is an opportunity for players as well – all players want to pit themselves against the best. Hopefully you can then go and get the right performance, then have a bit of fortune go our way as well.” Smith has also given his backing to Jack Grealish. The two were together at Aston Villa but Grealish has only scored two Premier League goal this season following his £100million move in the summer. “Jack is going to be a top, top player – and he has shown moments at City. I still speak to Jack quite regularly. He wants to find more consistency within the team there, but he is playing among a litter of star players there and he is one of them himself. “He is enjoying the experience of it and working with the likes of Pep Guardiola, he is learning more and more. Jack is a top talent and a top lad as well – and anybody who has worked with him will tell you that.” The Dirty Gunners topped the red card charts in 201920 with five, were second (again with five) behind Brighton last season and are now setting the pace alongside Aston Villa with three this term after Gabriel Martinelli’s sending off last night. Here’s how Ben Fisher described it in his match report: “Arsenal had Wolves at arm’s length but Martinelli picked up two yellow cards in a matter of seconds – the first for obstructing a throw-in and the second for a hot-headed trip on Chiquinho – to ensure a nervy crescendo. “He is expected to return in the first few days of March and his recovery has been going as predicted,” said Bielsa matter-of-factly ahead of Saturday’s trip to Everton. The England midfielder suffered a hamstring injury against Brentford in early December and underwent surgery later that month. He’s not the only Leeds player with a gammy hammie. Junior Firpo and Liam Cooper are still out with the same problem while contrarian Patrick Bamford is absent due to a foot injury.Ahead of last night’s 2-0 win over Leicester, Jurgen Klopp said “Sadio is in bed” but, hot news, Mane will return to training on Friday morning. Perhaps the Senegalese striker noted how well new signing Luis Diaz performed in his position last night and decided he best emerge from his slumbers. Klopp said on Friday: “Sadio will be available. He will come now this morning for training and will be in full training. “We make a decision after that. Emotionally he will still be high flying but we have to see how he is.” Klopp also confirmed captain Jordan Henderson will be back in the squad for the trip to Burnley after being rested against Leicester due to a back problem.“A draw or even a loss in either direction isn’t necessarily defining,” says the Blues boss. We’ll have a John Brewin MBM tonight, just to mark your cards. Here’s Suzanne Wrack’s scene setter. With Newcastle starting to build up a head of steam, the battle for relegation is expanding. Everton (home to Leeds) and Brentford (home to Crystal Palace) are certainly getting twitchy, their main hope being that crafty old-timer Roy Hodgson doesn’t pull some stunts at Watford. As for the battle to be least-worst of the rest, Manchester United, West Ham, Arsenal and Tottenham seem to take it in turns to trip over their own feet. Who do you trust? At the moment, it’s no-one. That, of course, leaves Chelsea who occupy a no-man’s land currently called third spot. Tommy T’s men don’t have a Premier League game this weekend because they’re taking on Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final on Saturday - a huge, huge deal in Brazil a bit of an afterthought over here. What’s not in doubt is the importance of Chelsea’s home game in the Women’s Super League tonight. Emma Hayes’ side are at home to leaders Arsenal and this could go a long way to deciding the title. The Gunners, who rather got away with a 1-1 draw against Manchester United last weekend, have the chance to pull five clear. But if Chelsea win, they’d go top by a point with a game in hand.

We don’t know what the delay is. Maybe there is concern over how news of a shortened school year will be received by parents.”The education system has faced criticism in the past over the length of the school year and school holidays at second level, in particular.A European Commission analysis found that secondary school students in Ireland have one of the shortest school years in Europe. Of the 37 countries included in the study, only France, Cyprus and Greece had a shorter school year.Teachers’ unions, however, say these figures are misleading and that secondary students in Ireland have slightly longer instruction time compared to the EU average.The number of days students in Ireland at primary level spend at school is closer to the European norm.Separately, new advice on whether face masks should remain mandatory in schools is expected shortly.Minister for Education Norma Foley said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is due to meet on Thursday next to review safety measures in schools such as mask wearing, physical distancing and other limits on school activities.Updated guidance is due to issue in advance of the return of school following the mid-term break on February 28th.Ms Foley said public health measures that have applied in schools have been a source of reassurance for many.ChallengesShe said she understood the challenges posed by risk mitigation measures but said they had allowed the return of in-person teaching.School managers and teachers’ unions in Ireland say they are opposed to a sudden relaxation of measures give the extent to which Covid-19 is continuing to circulate in schools.Séamus Mulconry, general secretary of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, which supports more than 2,800 primary schools, urged a cautious easing of restrictions.“The pandemic may be over for much of the public, but it is not over for schools,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"universal social charge cannot be abolished says donohoe","story":"Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe.

It was the integration of two levies. The USC will remain an important part of our tax system”. The charge could not be removed, if that was done it would have to be explained where else to generate the money it collects every year, he added.The Minister also defended the measures introduced to address increases in the cost of living particularly the universal energy rebate. It would bring support quickly to those who needed it most.“These measures will help families. We are using this money to respond to the real challenges people are facing.” The Government had been determined to get the balance right, he said.Mr Donohoe acknowledged that there were some who had experienced wage growth, but the majority of the measures were geared towards those who needed the most help.“The style of the social welfare system is that it is geared to help those who need it most.”The 20 per cent cut in fares on public transport was a significant measure, he said. The rationale behind the measure was to make a difference, but for it to also be sustainable.“This is a reduction of a fifth, it will be executed well and it will make a difference to those who use public transport.”The Government recognised that the measures would not meet everyone’s needs or would solve all the financial problems people were facing, he said.Earlier on Morning Ireland, Dermot O’Leary of the National Rail and Bus workers Union (NRBU) had expressed concern that the 20 per cent reduction in public transport fares would have an impact on wages of his members.Mr McGrath said

prehistoric","story":"A 5,000-year-old chalk “drum”, discovered in the grave of three children has been dubbed “the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years”.The intricately-carved chalk cylinder was first found in 2015, but its existence had not been revealed until Thursday.It\u0027s unearthing helps to prove that at the time Stonehenge was under construction, societies across the British Isles shared artistic and possibly religious customs rather than forming isolated communities.The drum will go on display as part of the World of Stonehenge exhibition that launches at the British Museum on February 17.Neil Wilkin, the curator of the exhibition said: “This is a truly remarkable discovery, and is the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years.”The drum, which has carved motives along its sides closely resembles the Folkton drums, which were found in 1889 and have been in the museum ever since.The new discovery, found in Burton Agnes in East Yorkshire, just 15 miles from Folkton, is only the fourth of its kind to be excavated.The Folkton find, however, was never successfully dated and little was known about the objects’ context.This latest discovery has allowed archaeologists to apply new technologies, including radiocarbon dating, unlocking information not just about the Burton Agnes find but the Folkton drums, too.The date of the burial and therefore the carving of the drums has been put at 3005–2890BC - the same period during which Stonehenge was first constructed.Archaeologists said this was significant because it showed that communities in Britain were sharing artistic styles and possibly religious beliefs across significant distances.Dr Wilkin, said: The elaborate motifs found here on the Burton Agnes drum and also on the British Museum’s Folkton drums, are seen on a range of prehistoric objects discovered across Britain and Ireland.“This tells us that there was an ‘artistic style’ of the people who built Stonehenge. Because we can date the burial this drum was found in, it means we know these ideas existed at the beginning of Stonehenge’s era. It’s game changing in that sense, and hugely exciting.Previously, archaeologists had believed the Folkton drums to have been carved 500 years later, well past the period of Stonehenge’s construction.What this remarkable discovery tells us is that the period of Stonehenge was not insular or shadowy as is often assumed. Here, and in the objects we are showing in the Stonehenge exhibition, we can see shared ideas and artistic styles that have made it to all four corners of these islands almost. Culture and ideas were massively interconnected even 5,000 years ago, just like today, said Dr Wilkin.The children the drum was buried with were of differing ages, with the two younger iniduals placed into the grave holding hands while the eldest child was found embracing them.Dr Wilkin called the grave “highly moving”, saying that “the emotions the new drum expresses are powerful and timeless, they transcend the time of Stonehenge and reflect a moment of tragedy and despair that remains undimmed after 5,000 years.Despite their names, the objects are not musical instruments but are thought to perhaps be protective talismans.The Burton Agnes drum was also found alongside a chalk ball and polished bone pin, which lay beneath the head of one of the children.The significance of both objects is unclear, but similar items have been found at other burials, again suggesting shared culture across Britain.The gravesite was found during routine archaeological excavations ahead of a construction project. For the past seven years, it has undergone extensive study and conservation work.Alice Beasley, a project archaeologist for Allen Archaeology who first uncovered the drum, said: “Discovering the chalk drum was a thrilling and humbling experience. Seeing the love and effort put into burying the iniduals over 5000 years ago was truly moving.”The new drum will go on display in the Stonehenge exhibition alongside all three Folkton drums. It will be displayed at the British Museum on loan from the Burton Agnes Estate.After the exhibition, it will undergo further assessment and analysis.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sadiq Khan accused of \u0026#39playing politics\u0026#39 by forcing out Cressida DickWashington urges Trudeau to use federal powers to end blockade of vital US-Canada trade bridgeRussia-Ukraine crisis: Kremlin amassing more troops on border and could invade at \u0026#39any time\u0026#39, warns US Labour MP Rosie Duffield: Keir Starmer is no better than Jeremy Corbyn and it almost made me defectThey say tanks don’t fear mud, but Russia should - especially in southern UkraineBoris Johnson lacks the leadership to fight inflationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"durham university told covid policies disgrace donor suspends","story":"Durham University has been told its Covid policies are a “disgrace” by a major donor who has suspended his support in protest at their prolonged use of online teaching.The Russell Group institution has “failed” its students, according to the millionaire Mark Hillery who has severed ties with his alma mater and resigned from the advisory committee of his old college.He told The Daily  that there is “simply no logic” in continuing to impose restrictions on students, adding: “The people spending their days dreaming this stuff up need putting back in their box now and told to do a proper job.”Over the past six years Mr Hillery, a retired hedge fund manager, has donated more than £7million to the university’s Collingwood College where he read engineering in the late Eighties.His money has funded various buildings and facilities including the Mark Hillery Arts Centre as well as a yoga and pilates studio, bar conservatory and expanded JCR common room and gym.He has also gained notoriety among students for putting large sums of money behind the college bar when he visits to fund free drinks for them all night.But Mr Hillery has now cut ties with the university and told his old college that he does not wish to engage with any further dialogue.“Someone had to say something publicly about this ongoing insanity for the sake of the students. It’s depressing it has to be that way,” he said.“The final trigger for me, and I warned them it would come, was the imposition of ridiculous rules and restrictions way beyond what prevailed in ‘normal’ society from the beginning of the new academic year in late September.“The reversion to online teaching at the start of this term took the madness to another level, but the damage had already been done for me since September.”He told the Durham student newspaper Palatinate that the online teaching at the start of this term was an “unequivocal disgrace” given that the Government’s policy was for face-to-face teaching to take place.When students returned after Christmas they were told that all lectures would take place online for the first fortnight of term, blaming omicron for fuelling “large numbers of Covid-19 cases.Only labs and practical classes were allowed to go ahead in person during the first week of term and small to medium teaching groups of fewer than 40 students were allowed to take place face-to-face during the second.The university operates a “test to participate” where students must have evidence of a negative lateral flow test taken up to 48 hours previously in order to visit college bars, play sport or attend formal dinners. A spokesman said on Thursday that this scheme would be wound down over the coming weeks but that voluntary testing would still be encouraged. Students are expected to wear face masks throughout the university\u0027s buildings. Government guidance states that “no student should be denied education on the grounds that they are, or are not, wearing a face covering”.Mr Hillery said: “Higher education establishments have collectively short-changed their clients for too long here and that was simply the final slap in the face.”“They all deserve bottom marks. They have failed some of our most talented kids here. Their priorities have been totally misaligned.“It is both bizarre and deeply cruel that the last people in the country to have this insanity imposed on them are healthy 20-year-olds for whom Covid is an irrelevance, and the majority of which are vaccinated and have had Covid anyway…who makes that up with a straight face?”A Durham University spokesman said Mark Hillery was a generous benefactor whose contributions have improved our students’ experience and will continue to make an impact for many years to come.They added that their approach throughout the pandemic had “always prioritised the health, safety and wellbeing of our staff, students and wider community”.They said they had “taken into account a wide range of information and perspectives” including both Government guidelines and advice from local public health directors.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sadiq Khan accused of \u0026#39playing politics\u0026#39 by forcing out Cressida DickWashington urges Trudeau to use federal powers to end blockade of vital US-Canada trade bridgeRussia-Ukraine crisis: Kremlin amassing more troops on border and could invade at \u0026#39any time\u0026#39, warns US Labour MP Rosie Duffield: Keir Starmer is no better than Jeremy Corbyn and it almost made me defectThey say tanks don’t fear mud, but Russia should - especially in southern UkraineBoris Johnson lacks the leadership to fight inflationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"starry night mesmerising photo milky way wins astrophotography","story":"A photograph of the Milky Way in all its glory has claimed the top prize in an astrophotography competition organised by the South Downs National Park. \u0027Snow in Springtime\u0027, shot by Neil Jones, captured the starry sky above St Mary\u0027s Church near Upwaltham in West Sussex.

It’s got a serenity about it which I rather like.The runner-up in the category went to \u0027Valley of Stars\u0027, shot by Michael Harris, which shows a night-time view of Devil\u0027s Dyke, near Brighton. Commenting on the photo, Ms Francis-Baker said: I just want to e into this picture – it really encapsulates the South Downs National Park for me.In the Living Dark Skies category, the judges crowned \u0027Stargazing\u0027 by Pablo Rodriguez as the winner. The image captures a walker gazing at the night sky from the Seven Sisters cliffs near Eastbourne. Ms Francis-Baker described the archway in the image as amazing, and added that the colours are beautiful. Meanwhile, entrants in the final category had the capture of the magnificence of the moon or the milky way. The winner of the category was \u0027Towering Super Moon\u0027 by Richard Murray, which shows the moon rising behind the Vandalian Tower near South Harting. Commenting on the image, Mr Bryant said: The moon rises fairly quickly, so clearly this photographer has thought about this and got into the right position at just the right moment. Another five minutes and you would not be able to get this shot.Ms Francis-Baker said she loved the wobbly edge of the moon. It’s nice that it looks natural and I love the big expansive sky with the birds flying, she said. Mr Oakley added: It’s quite a simple picture to take. This shows you can get out in the National Park with a camera and take a really amazing photograph in 30 seconds.The South Downs National Park is one of 19 International Dark Sky Reserves, recognising it as one of the best and most accessible places in the world to see immense views of the cosmos.The winners were awarded prizes of £100, while the runners-up received £75.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sadiq Khan accused of \u0026#39playing politics\u0026#39 by forcing out Cressida DickWashington urges Trudeau to use federal powers to end blockade of vital US-Canada trade bridgeRussia-Ukraine crisis: Kremlin amassing more troops on border and could invade at \u0026#39any time\u0026#39, warns US Labour MP Rosie Duffield: Keir Starmer is no better than Jeremy Corbyn and it almost made me defectThey say tanks don’t fear mud, but Russia should - especially in southern UkraineBoris Johnson lacks the leadership to fight inflationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"whisper beginning see boris just might survive","story":"He’d never admit it, but Boris Johnson was all set to lock down the country last December. He was saved by his weakness. He had (again) been terrified by his scientific advisers, who wanted him to move quickly: he called a meeting for Monday December 20 to do the deed. But on the Friday before it, he lost a by-election. The next day Lord Frost resigned from the Government, appalled at its Left-wards drift. Three more Cabinet members said they’d quit if he took Sage’s advice. When the lockdown meeting came, he buckled.The Prime Minister we see before us now is a very different creature to the one who governed by diktat for the best part of two years. He’s humbly asking Tory MPs what to do, then doing it. It’s humiliating, but it’s greatly improving the quality of the Government. He has broken free from Sage (whose advice on omicron turned out to be bunkum) and didn’t seek its advice before deciding to abolish all remaining Covid restrictions a month early. Warming to his theme, he’s now referring to this as “freedom day”.Some of his worst ideas are being abandoned. His plans to set up an all-powerful Animal Sentience Committee to judge government policy now look doomed. His anti-obesity strategy – whereby a Conservative government would tell shops what sort of food they could and could not promote – is being shelved.“That was his personal idea,” says one minister, “so to see it abandoned showed how his personal power has vanished. But it helps him. People resent him less.”Politically, this is certainly humbling – but it seems to be working insofar as the rebellion is losing steam. Parliament is breaking up for half-term with no immediate threat to his leadership. He has been lucky in his enemies: when Christian Wakeford defected to Labour he revived the Tories’ sense of tribal loyalty. Being attacked by Sir John Major, who has never recovered from the Brexit referendum result, will also have helped him. An attempt to change the rules of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers – to make it easier to depose him – has also failed.This holds out the prospect – no more than that – of the big-state, bossy Boris giving way to the buccaneering, risk-taking and freedom-loving leader they thought they were getting when they first elected him. So far, it seems he’s prepared to do anything to survive. Even reform the NHS.There was an interesting moment in the Commons on Tuesday after Sajid Javid broke the news that – in spite of the extra money – the NHS waiting list will surge rather than fall. Conservative MPs were aghast: they had broken their promise not to raise tax but thought they’d (just about) get away with it if the cash fixed the NHS. Now they learn that they’ll fight the next general election having imposed the tax but with waiting lists far higher than they are even now.So it was a typical Boris bad idea: a tax rise forced through, but with no one working out how little difference the extra cash would make.From the back benches, Sir Edward Leigh raised a question. If repairing the NHS is not doable, he asked, what happens to those who don’t have a year or two to wait for an operation? If private insurance means you can be treated in weeks, might the cost of this insurance be written off against tax, as it used to be? This idea would once have been dismissed out of hand as the roar of a Tory dinosaur, but the Health Secretary said he’d think about it.He’ll be doing a lot of thinking – and the result may well be something resembling an NHS reform plan. At a recent Cabinet awayday, the Prime Minister said after months of NHS pom-pom waving he now realises the need to change – and that Javid would be changing the NHS as radically as Michael Gove once reformed schools. So Javid has the green light – although not, as yet, much of an agenda.The need to reform is now horribly apparent. When the NHS was first promised £12 billion from the National Insurance rise, ministers were told that this should cut waiting lists to 5.5 million. Unpublished NHS modelling says it could be 11 million. It’s a staggering difference: one Tory MP said that, when he heard the news, he thought this was the moment that the party lost the next general election. To have taxes at a 71-year high and the largest NHS waiting list in history would represent abject political failure.But if reform starts now, there may be some hope. Patients who wait more than six months, for example, could be subsidised (or covered) if they want to go private. The idea of a patient’s passport, an old Conservative policy, could be dusted down.Reforming the NHS carries huge political risks. But the current situation – a gargantuan bill and a waiting list that has more people than the population of most European countries – brings guaranteed political disaster. And that’s before factoring in the hour-long ambulance waits and the 500 people a day who wait more than 12 hours to be seen at A\u0026ampE.Johnson will have a bit more time now: even those who want him gone talk about the May elections as the next date. “But even that sounds like procrastination,” says one minister. “No one can think of a better idea, so it’s fizzling out.”Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss remain the two favourites to succeed Johnson. Neither is ready to run now, or in the near future. Nor are their allies fomenting rebellion: some of them are actively talking it down, saying that Johnson is likely to survive as he has done before.The current obsession with the Met’s investigation into Partygate might, paradoxically, help the Prime Minister. If he is not fined, he can claim vindication – and move, straightaway, to focus on his great Covid reopening. If he keeps moving while his enemies are still, there’s every chance of his regaining momentum.With an approval rating almost as low as John Major’s, the chances of a full Johnsonian recovery look slim. But as one of his loyalists puts it: “The aim is to make it to Valentine’s Day, then May Day, then summer. So far, so good.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sadiq Khan accused of \u0026#39playing politics\u0026#39 by forcing out Cressida DickWashington urges Trudeau to use federal powers to end blockade of vital US-Canada trade bridgeRussia-Ukraine crisis: Kremlin amassing more troops on border and could invade at \u0026#39any time\u0026#39, warns US Labour MP Rosie Duffield: Keir Starmer is no better than Jeremy Corbyn and it almost made me defectThey say tanks don’t fear mud, but Russia should - especially in southern UkraineBoris Johnson lacks the leadership to fight inflationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"energy crunch going get worse","story":"The second of these policies would, on the other hand, be hugely popular. All pumped up by rising oil and gas prices, BP and Shell alone are expected to clock combined profits of more than $40 billion this year. A one-off confiscation of, say, a quarter of that amount would come close to paying for the £9 billion package of measures Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, has announced to help ease the burden of rising fuel bills.I’m not going to get too far into the detail of why this is such a destructive and impractical idea. But the last time the Tories gave in to pressure from Labour and the Lib Dems for populist energy policy, by imposing a supposed price cap on energy bills, it proved a monumental disaster on just about every level you care to take.The basic point of principle is that if there are excess profits to be made, it is better that the markets decide how they are reinvested and allocated than they are just squandered anew by government on supporting consumption.One of the great structural weaknesses of the UK economy is that we under-invest and over-consume. A windfall profits tax to cut energy bills would merely compound this failing.And boy does there need to be investment in our energy industries if we are ever to see the back of inflated fuel prices. Big oil may today be making record profits, but a year ago, amid the economic hiatus of lockdown, it was making record losses. Global energy investment collapsed correspondingly. Already we see the consequences in much higher energy bills.More concerning still, there are only limited signs of recovery in spending on energy renewal as the economy picks up again.This applies not just to fossil fuels – where reluctance to invest is understandable given the signals coming from government and from corporate “Environmental, Social and Governance” net zero agendas – but to renewables and the infrastructure to support them, where investment is also woefully short of what’s required to meet future energy needs. The old is steadily wasting away for want of care and attention, but the investment isn’t there to replace it with something else.For business investment to flourish requires certainty this is especially the case when applied to the long lead times of energy investment. Nobody is going to invest if the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, or if having done so, the rewards are confiscated the moment governments think it opportune.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Sadiq Khan accused of \u0026#39playing politics\u0026#39 by forcing out Cressida DickWashington urges Trudeau to use federal powers to end blockade of vital US-Canada trade bridgeRussia-Ukraine crisis: Kremlin amassing more troops on border and could invade at \u0026#39any time\u0026#39, warns US Labour MP Rosie Duffield: Keir Starmer is no better than Jeremy Corbyn and it almost made me defectThey say tanks don’t fear mud, but Russia should - especially in southern UkraineBoris Johnson lacks the leadership to fight inflationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz member royal family read bedtime","story":"In the week that saw Carrie Johnson’s role in Downing Street scrutinised after a biography containing claims about her wanting to control everything was serialised in a Sunday newspaper, The \u0027s news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to the headlines.Researchers in Oxfordshire broke the world record for the amount of energy produced by nuclear fusion power.

The Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People has sent a “letter before action” demanding ministers “come clean” about techniques it claims is throwing disabled claimants into crisis. The campaign group says disabled people have had questions raised over their benefit claims through a phone call, e-mail or “brown envelope” in the post without knowing why. Sometimes they have essential cash “cut off” at the beginning of probes that can last over a year, the group said. GMCDP spokesperson Rick Burgess said benefit claimants of all stripes are singled out, but campaigners believe the algorithm is “over-picking disabled people for investigations of fraud”. He told a meeting tonight: “You have no idea how it came about that you’re being investigated - none whatsoever. “It’s extremely upsetting when people get this.”  He added: “We are living in a shadow penal system that treats us like criminals for having to meet the same needs as everyone . The fear of the brown envelope makes disabled people feel terrorised, in a constant state of anxiety and on edge.” It is the second legal letter sent by the same group on the subject, with the first going out before Christmas. The DWP responded in December, but the group alleges the government has still not answered key questions about what technology it uses to flag possible fraud.  The fresh legal letter - to which the DWP must respond in  days - challenges the “use of AI, algorithmic technology and other forms of automation” in investigation of benefit fraud. It says the DWP uses “data matching” and “machine learning”, but other techniques may be being used and the DWP is not being clear about what they are. The letter says there is a “risk of bias” to automated processing.  It demands the DWP set out “detailed information” on its use of computer processes and sets up “adequate safeguards”. Barrister Will Perry, who is representing the legal action supported by the “tech justice” group Foxglove and Privacy International, said: “We know there is a data matching algorithm being used. “The DWP seem to be experimenting with a wide range of dferent technologies.” DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield has previously insisted computer systems “guide our work” but “we do not take any action against anyone based on a machine.” He added: “It always comes down to an inidual.” Universal Credit director-general Neil Couling said last year: “It is not an algorithm in the way in which I think people may understand an algorithm.“All we are doing is data matching,… We take what the RTI [earnings] data tells us, and whether a person has reported earnings to us.” A spokesman for the DWP said: “The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People in due course.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsDisability\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was unclear tonight whether Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty or Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance were even consulted on Wednesday’s announcement – which came before PMQs in the Commons instead of at a press conference.The Department of Health refused to confirm whether their advice was sought on ending restrictions. A No spokesman would only say they continue to provide advice to the Prime Minister and Health Secretary. And as curbs including the requirement to self-isolateinfected look set to end a month early, on February , other Government scientists said the news had blindsided them.  Prof John Edmunds, a member of Independent SAGE, said: “We haven’t discussed it there.” He added of the PM: “Of course he gets scientic advice from where as well – the UKHSA [UK Health Security Agency] and others – so he may have had other scientic advice but not that I’m aware of.” He added: “Of course there are dangers. There are dangers when you lt any restriction. This restriction is the last one and quite rightly so. It targets those who are actually infectious and asks them to stay at home.” Another scientist questioned Mr Johnson’s motives for making England the first country to end all pandemic curbs despite sky-high infection rates. Prof Tim Spector, the epidemiologist running Kingaposs College London’s Zoe Covid study, said: “This is more a political type of statement rather than a scientic one.There is some rationale to this and other countries are doing things similar, but it’s clearly a race for the Government to say that Britain is first.” Dr Stephen Grfin of Leeds University said: “Literally blinding ourselves by removing testing and isolation robs us of the most fundamental means of controlling the spread.”  After  Covid deaths and , positive tests reported in the UK today, the British Medical Association called on the Government to justy ending self-isolation rules. The BMA’s Dr Penelope Toff said: “The suggestion that self-isolation may be removed this month runs contrary to good public health practice.“The Government needs to show the evidence behind its proposals. There are still more than , patients with Covid in UK hospitals.”New data from the Zoe Covid study this week suggested cases may still be rising, with an R value of . for the UK. The study estimates there were , new daily symptomatic cases at the start of this week, up from , last week, though Prof Spector said hospital admissions and deaths were down.  People with conditions that mean Covid vaccines may not work for them voiced alarm at the plan to end isolation rules. Grandad Paul Simpson, , from Rochester, Kent, was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma brain cancer last year. He said: “They seem to be prepared, in order to hold the Tory party together or to gain popularity in the nation, to throw quite a lot of people under the bus.” Hannah Burden, , spent  days in intensive care with Covid before Christmas. The student, from Leicestershire, told The Mirror: “By the end of the month you could be in the supermarket with people who know they have Covid.”  Blood Cancer UK estimates more than , people with the condition will be at an increased risk. Of plans to protect the vulnerable, the Department of Health said details would “follow in due course”. The plan to end curbs on February  will be reviewed three days before.

In an interview with The Times, Sir Keir said Mr Johnson had used a deliberate slur without any basis in fact. The PM knew exactly what he was doing. It is a conspiracy theory of violent fascists that has been doing the rounds for some time, he said. Mr Johnson last week ly accused his rival of failing to prosecute notorious paedophile Jimmy Savile while he was director of public prosecutions.On Monday, police escorted the Labour leader away from demonstrators, some of whom accused him of protecting paedophiles. I have never been called a paedophile protector before. That happened yesterday for the first time in my le, Sir Keir said.  If others want to argue that this is unconnected with precisely what the Prime Minister said one week before then let them make that case. But theyaposll never persuade me that there is no link. Itaposs not about me, itaposs the way we conduct our politics. I donapost want to see us go down the route that this potentially takes us. Earlier, Sir Keiraposs spokesperson said he was fine after the incident. A spokesman for the opposition leader told reporters: He was back at his desk straight after. Police did their job. Obviously these things look sort of rougher on the camera often than they are. But, as I say, police did a good job, he was back at his desk afterwards and he was off playing five-a-side football that night as normal. A host of Conservative and opposition MPs have called for Mr Johnson to apologise for what was branded a scurrilous accusation against Sir Keir.  The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman acknowledged his original words last week in the Commons were capable of being misconstrued and said that was why he subsequently issued a clarication.The Prime Minister claried his remarks last week to make clear he was not suggesting Keir Starmer was inidually responsible for the Savile decision, the spokesman said.He added: I think the Prime Minister was making a political point about taking responsibility for organisations as a whole. Mr Johnson tweeted on Monday evening that the behaviour directed at the Labour leader was absolutely disgraceful. Although Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service in  when a decision was taken not to prosecute Savile, he had no personal involvement in the deliberations.Labour said Mondayaposs incident occurred when Sir Keir, who was accompanied by shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, was walking back from the Ministry of Defence after a briefing on the situation in Ukraine.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Labour PartyThe TimesMinistry of DefenceJimmy SavileDavid LammyBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes amid a furious row over £ million worth of contracts handed to test firm Randox - who paid former Tory MP Owen Paterson as an advisor. The Government was forced to release papers relating to the deal last week.Among the disclosures were text messages between Matt Hancock and Mr Paterson - showing how the former MP lobbied the then-Health Secretary on behalf of the firm.In one message, Mr Paterson suggested the pair discuss speeding up the process in the Commons voting lobbies during a vote. But hauled before MPs today, Health Minister Maggie Throup repeatedly refused to confirm the meeting took place.Asking an urgent question following the release of the documents, Labour chair Anneliese Dodds said: Theypaint a picture of a Conservative Government that is simply unfit for office. That the Conservative Government played fast and loose with public money. It handed Randox a £ million contract, without competition.On the meeting between then-health minister Lord Bethell, Mr Paterson and Randox on April  , the Labour Party chairwoman said: There are still no minutes of that crucial meeting on April . Just a rough draft email, sent seven months later. Two years on, the department canapost even explain who was there.Health ministers held, we now know, another four meetings that were never declared in the register. So how many more secret meetings were there  The Labour chairwoman added: The file showed that this former MP, a paid advocate for Randox, was arranging meetings with the health secretary in the ision lobby. A place which only MPs can have access and where it is impossible for civil servants to join them.Ms Throup made no apology for the Governmentaposs actions to acquire Covid testing equipment, and suggested the note released in the Randox files about the meeting on April  is the equivalent of an official record of a meeting. She said: When the department received a Freedom of Information request for the minutes of this meeting, the private secretary found the minutes and shared it. And for clarity, notes and minutes mean an official record of a meeting. The words mean the same from an official meetingaposs record point of view.  Ms Throup also stressed there are robust rules and processes in place to assure that all contracts are awarded in line with procurement regulations and transparency guidelines. She added: Direct awards, like in this case, are permitted by the public contract regulations for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events. Iaposm sure no member would deny that this was a situation of extreme urgency. The minister faced further questions about the meeting in the ision lobby, with Hull North MP Dame Diana Johnson asking: The documents showed that there was a meeting with the former member for North Shropshire and the former secretary of state for health and social care in the ision lobbies... Did that meeting take place  Ms Throup replied: The evidence has been put in the library and obviously information is there and obviously I want to make it clear that my department went through as much evidence as they could. Dame Diana could be heard shouting yes or no! as the minister answered.  Mr Paterson resigned from the Commons in November last year, after he was found to have lobbied - against parliamentary rules - on behalf of Randox, for which he was a paid consultant. The saga prompted a sleaze scandal in Westminster after Boris Johnsonaposs Government launched a defence of Mr Paterson and tried to save him from a -day suspension, only to back down when under considerable pressure.The documents released on Friday February  show the extent to which Mr Paterson was in contact with the then health secretary over Randoxaposs offers to provide coronavirus testing services.A spokesperson for Matt Hancock said: The extensive transparency publication proves Matt did nothing wrong. So much so, we encourage your readers to look at it. To suggest Matt was doing anything other than acting in the national interest is not journalism but proof of an agenda. Matt cannot control who contacts him, but he followed protocol and Owen Patersonaposs lobbying was flagged to officials. To suggest Matt should have ignored the UK’s biggest existing testing capacity because he was being contacted by Owen Paterson is absurd and would have been a dereliction of duty. Matt is incredibly grateful to Randox for the enormous part they have played in the national effort to combat covid.

On the desk in front of him - from where he read out quiz questions to teams across the building - is what appears to be champagne and a half-eaten packet of crisps. Mr Johnson was accused of personally breaking Covid laws by hosting the festive event after the Mirror revealed last year that it had taken place. At the time London was under Tier  regulations banning any social mixing between two or more people from dferent households.  Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Just two days after the Mirroraposs initial story, the PM said: “I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules. But the Christmas quiz is not one of the dozen No  gatherings under investigation by police. This is despite a smaller festive quiz held in the Cabinet Office just two days later being looked at. One Covid laws expert said that Scotland Yard should now add the Downing Street Christmas quiz to the list of events it is probing. Barrister Adam Wagner told The Mirror: The previous photograph of the Prime Minister showed what could have been a meeting briefly interrupted by a Zoom call. However, the new photograph shows four people with alcohol and food, as well as a Christmas hat and tinsel, which suggests a Christmas party. This was held at a time when indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned and the Government had told people they must not have a Christmas party. The top lawyer added: In light of the new evidence it now makes no sense for this gathering not to be investigated by the police given that an almost identical gathering in the Cabinet Secretary Simon Caseaposs office two dayaposs later is being investigated. In the new image, Mr Johnson appears to be putting a badge on his suit jacket.  Later that evening, No  pins were distributed to Downing Street staff as a Christmas present from the PM. Downing Street has insisted the event was a “virtual quiz”, but admitted “those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.” Labour MP Fabian Hamilton raised the photo in PMQs - and contrasted the merriment to a constituent who was unable to have visits from her family while having cancer treatment. He said: For the sake of my constituent and the sacrices she made, will the PM be referring this party to the police as itaposs not one of the parties being investigated  But the PM hit back, saying: He is completely in error. He later said the event had been submitted for investigation. Former No aide Dominic Cummings warned: Thereaposs waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl in the flat. No pointed out the event itself had already been considered by Scotland Yard, which decided not to investigate it further. But the PM’s Press Secretary could not say whether the newly-revealed photo had been sent to the Met, saying: “I’m not aware of that and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment”. Of Sue Gray, the Press Secretary added: “She has had access to all information that is relevant and required.” Asked what was happening in the picture, she said: Weaposve talked about this one before, it is a virtual quiz. The Mirror revealed last year that dozens of staff had spent the evening huddling in groups around their office computers rather than dialling in from home. In one office, the insider said, there were four teams, each made up of six people. Sources said staff had knocked back fizz, wine and beer - and some stayed in Number  socialising and drinking for hours after the quiz finished at .pm. Team names included Professor Quiz Whitty, Next Slide Please, Weaposve Been Clear”, “The  Masketeers” and Hands, Face, First Place - a reference to the slogan introduced to encourage social distancing and mask wearing.  The Mirror also revealed an email showing organisers had planned days in advance for some staff to enjoy the quiz in person, from the office. A senior official even urged staff, including teams from the PMaposs private office, the policy unit and the press office, to leave No  through the back door at the end of the night. Mr Johnson has spent the last few days trying to shore up support after mass resignations from No  last week raised further questions about his authority. Downing Street is hoping his defensive mini-reshuffle to promote loyalists - and the promise of a bigger reshuffle in early summer - will be enough to keep mutinous Tory MPs at bay. But many Tories are privately saying they are waiting for the result of the Met investigation and the full Sue Gray report to decide whether to trigger a confidence vote. The PMaposs allies have claimed that he will not resign evenhe is fined by the politan Police for breaching Covid rules. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror: “If Sue Gray finds he lied to parliament unequivocally, or depending what action police take - that’s it. Either of those two things would be terminal.

Small loans announced by the Government – that must be repaid by us – are cold comfort after the energy price cap was lted £. Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VAT. Even Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron imposed one-off levies on North Sea producers. The resistance of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to a similar move means this Government is siding with big corporations against working people.  Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors. Once again we witness Johnson caring only about himself. Conservative MPs should throw him overboard to save themselves.

Covid restrictions will begin to ease next week, with the requirement for vaccine passports to enter nightclubs, cinemas and concert venues to be scrapped on February . But events and venues will be able to continue to use itthey choose to. From February , face coverings will no longer be mandatory in most indoor public places but they will still be required for shops, public transport and health and care settings. Pupils will no longer have to wear masks in class from this date and heads can decide their own rules. All face covering rules will be axed at the end of Marchthe Covid situation continues to improve.Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who is currently self-isolating with Covid, has taken a more cautious approach to lting restrictions than Boris Johnson, who is planning to scrap remaining restrictions in two weeks time. Wales will keep the self isolation requirement for positive cases, which Mr Johnson has controversially decided to axe. Economy Minister Vaughan Gethin said the remaining restrictions may be removed at the end of March.At that point we may move to self-isolation being guidance rather than mandatory but at this point we think it is still important to have that as a protective measure in law, he told the BBC.He said this was a highly unusual move to axe all rules in England, which had not been discussed between the Welsh governmentaposs and the UK Governmentaposs top medics. He added: Thereaposd been no advice from SAGE, no joint recommendation or discussion between chief medical officers saying that this was the right thing to do, no scientic advice provided, no meeting between health ministers in advance. Things which would have been quite normalsignicant changes were being made in the course of the pandemic. It comes amid some concern about Mr Johnsonaposs drastic to ease remaining Covid restrictions within weeks in England. The Prime Minister is expected to set out a new plan on Living with Covid when MPsfrom recess on February . This includes scrapping the legal requirement for people to self isolatethey test positive for the virus. Top scientic advisers Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance have not been seen in public since the bombshell announcement, prompting questions over whether they back the move. The Department of Health refused to confirm whether their advice was sought on ending restrictions.A No spokesman would only say they continue to provide advice to Mr Johnson and Health Secretary Sajid Javid.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They say they have been told during inspection visits that it is due to condensation from breathing. The problem is now at the point where the couple say theyaposve noticed their sinuses have become aposbunged upapos and they are both worried the situation could be exacerbating their pre-existing health conditions.East Riding of Yorkshire Council said work was due to start on the property soon to address the issues, reports Hull Live. Dawn, , suffers from rheumatoid arthritis as well as being in remission for cancer, while mechanic Tony also has a lung condition.But the pair say they canapost move from the property for financial reasons, as well as Dawn struggling with a bad back from a head-on car crash she was in over  years ago.  It started eight years ago in the two bedrooms and itaposs just got worse, said former nurse Dawn. The little bedroom is now just black and the wallpaper is peeling away. Weaposve had to throw out our own furniture because of it and you can smell it when you walk in - itaposs disgusting. Itaposs even eaten through the back of a wardrobe which was against the wall. We donapost know what weaposre breathing in. Dawn and Tony have tried all kinds of DIY solutions to fix the problem short-term and theyaposve had a council inspector out  times over the eight years. They claim they were told the problem is caused by condensation from breathing mixed with dead skin, as well as having furniture only an inch from the walls. Theyaposre now seeking legal advice. The couple came forward off the back of another Drfield resident, Amy Robinson, who has reported problems with mould in her council home. Amy claims a council inspector similarly told her the problem was caused by condensation from drying clothes indoors.  Air vents were put in at Dawn and Tonyaposs bungalow to improve ventilation in the rooms, but the couple said this has not improved the problem and only made the house colder. Theyaposve also spent thousands on the property over the years with the councilaposs permission, renovating the bathroom, installing new windows and even a driveway. Weaposve spent too much on the house now to move again, Dawn explained. Moving is expensive and we canapost afford it. A spokesperson for East Riding of Yorkshire Council, which rents the property to the couple, said: Following a recent inspection at the property, work will shortly begin to address the issues identied. We will maintain contact during and following the work at the property with the tenants to ensure these issues are resolved in a satisfactory manner.

Kevin, from Inverkeithing, had spent a decade battling pain before doctors discovered he had the rare disease. In  he underwent an extraordinary operation to remove the monster tumour.A team of  surgeons removed the gigantic mass in an amazing -hour operation. The mammoth procedure allowed former union organsier Kevin to see his two boys Jack, , and Nathan, , grow up. Treatments for benign tumors saw doctors taking out six of Kevin’s ribs, two-thirds of his shoulder blade, moving muscle from his lower back, and rebuilding his chest - all of which left him suffering from chronic pain, reports the Daily Record.Ill health had taken its toll on Kevinaposs body, but his death came out of the blue for his devastated family.

My dad has been really ill at dferent points in the last  years but it wasnapost anything like that, he just died in his sleep suddenly. There had been a lot of times when my step-mum Kirsty called to say she had taken him to the hospital and I thought his passing was imminent.  He struggled a lot but even when I saw him a couple of weeks ago he seemed well. But everything that he had gone through had taken a toll on his body. Weaposre just thankful he died peacefully. I donapost think people realise just how bad the chronic pain was he had to live with. He picked up my brother every day from school and was always busy organising fundraisers - he did so much even when he was ill. He was my hero and Iaposve never seen such courage.

Thinking of Kirsty, Nathan, Jack and all family and friends. RIP Big Man.  Jack added: My dad really was an amazing guy - I canapost believe the number of people from all walks of le who have been in touch saying he touched their lives. He was an extraordinary man who dedicated much of his le to helping others. He always told me how proud he was of me, I just hope he knew how proud I was of him. In the face of a horric rare illness, invasive and traumatic treatments, and unrelenting chronic pain he did his utmost to act as a pillar of strength for our family, raise my -year-old brother, Nathan, and be an amazing Dad to us both.

Dame Cressida announced on Thursday she would be stepping down after losing the backing of London Mayor Sadiq Khan in the wake of a series of scandals during her tenure leading. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was not satisfied Dame Cressida could root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exist in the force or restore Londonersapos trust.Dame Cressida acknowledged the Metaposs failings in her statement, which said: “The murder of Sarah Everard and many other awful cases recently have, I know, damaged confidence in this fantastic police service. There is much to do – and I know that the Met has turned its full attention to rebuilding public trust and confidence.”Describing her decision to resign, she said: “It is with huge sadness that following contact with the Mayor of London today, it is clear that the Mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue. He has left me no choice but to step aside as Commissioner of the politan Police Service. The mayor and Home Secretary Priti Patel will now begin the search for a new Commissioner.Without a clear frontrunner to replace the outgoing commissioner, here is a look at some of the likely candidates Neil Basu  Neil Basu, another assistant commissioner who previously worked as the head of counter-terrorism, is thought to be a likely candidate. Mr Basu has spent his entire career serving in the politan Police.In a  interview with , he said thatsomeone used the racially offensive comments Boris Johnson had, they would not be admitted into the police force.For some, the comments were seen as political and could prove detrimental to his chances of succeeding Dame Cressida. But Mr Basu is popular among officers and is still widely seen as capable. He is also the most senior police officer of Asian heritage and would be the first minority ethnic commissioner.Matt Jukes  Matt Jukes, an assistant politan Police commissioner currently working as head of counter-terrorism, is seen by many commentators as a likely contender.Mr Jukes first joined South Yorkshire Police as a Pc before moving to South Wales Police and working his way up the ranks.He rose to become chief constable of South Wales Police before ing to the politan Police as an assistant commissioner in . So unlike Dame Cressida, who never ran her own force before becoming commissioner, he has prior experience at the helm. Sir Stephen House  Sir Stephen House is the Deputy Commissioner of the politan Police, just below Dame Cressida, and so is a natural contender for the job.The Scottish police officer has worked in several dferent forces and was appointed chief constable of Police Scotland in .However, during his tenure leading Police Scotland he faced criticism for his use of armed patrols as well as stop and search. He eventually resigned in  over the deaths of Lamara Bell and John Yuill, who lay undiscovered in a wrecked car for three days despite a call from a member of the public. But in , he became an assistant commissioner at the politan Police and was promoted to deputy commissioner by the end of the year.Lucy DaposOrsi Current Chief Constable of the British Transport Police, Lucy previously worked as a senior officer at the politan Police. During her career, she was in charge of the police response to the Beaufort Park fire in  and she headed up security during Chinese leader Xi Jinpingaposs visit to the UK in .She would be following in Dame Cressidaaposs footsteps as the second woman to become politan Police commissioner. Nick Ephgrave  Nick Ephgrave, assistant commissioner for frontline policing, is also in with a chance of getting the top job.Mr Ephgrave began his career at the politan Police but moved to become chief constable of Surrey Police in late .In , he ed to the politan Police as an assistant commissioner. Like Mr Jukes, he also already has experience leading a police force. Families of those failed by the Met Police have also spoken out since Cressida Dickaposs announcement to step down. The brother of Stephen Lawrence, who was killed in a racially motivated attack in , has said the politan Police commissioneraposs resignation was needed and it has set the police on a pathway now of seeing real change. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Stuart Lawrence said: I have met her a good couple of times and those meetings always have been productive, she has always come across to me personally as someone who wants to implement change and wants to see things done dferently, but she just hasnapost been able to really put that down to the rest of the forces and the people who are responsible for the dferent teams throughout the politan Police force.Its a big service, thereaposs lots of dferent members and lots of dferent moving parts and itaposs a big job and we really need someone thataposs going to be put in post now thataposs going really to be able to stamp a real clean step of a new direction to go in. Ricky Waumsley, whose partner Daniel Whitworth was murdered by serial killer Stephen Port, said he didnapost have much faith in Dame Cressida Dick when he met her just before Christmas. He said he welcomed her resignation as she definitely needed to go. Outlining his meeting with the former Met chief after an inquest into the deaths of Portaposs victims concluded in December, Mr Waumsley told the Today programme on BBC Radio : It went OK. She came across [as] friendly and she said she was going to look into improving the Met Police, but I didnapost really have much faith in her.  Explaining why, he said it was due to a combination of the scale of what had happened and because of that meeting. Thereaposs so much homophobic, sexist and racist stuff going on within the Met Police right now. I donapost think she is capable of sorting out these issues, he said. He said he is calling for an investigation into the officers who handled the case to be reopened. Last year, Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball issued an apology on behalf of the Met but rejected the claim that homophobia played a part in its investigation into Port.

Some critics have even askedhe “even knew he was getting married”. TikTok user Violet Price, , shared a now-infamous clip on the , showing her glamorous best friend Catherine Nicholson getting married to her casually-attired groom.According to Yorkshire Live reports, the clip has received more than . million views.Many social media users took issue with the apparent lack of effort behind the mystery groom’s choice of attire. For the celebratory occasion, the groom opted for a black t-shirt from the streetwear brand, Palm Angels, and paired it with grey washed jeans and trainers. His bride Catherine, , went for a more traditional approach and was pictured wearing a white mermaid style wedding gown, complete with cinched waist and a long lace train.  In the video, Catherine and Violet could be seen having fun on a fairground ride while Violet accompanied the footage with the caption: My best friend a couple of months ago telling me she ainapost gunna fall in love. In the accompanying audio, they can also both be heard chanting, I ainapost falling in love this summer, I do my thing this summer in the background, before the video cuts to Catherine on her wedding day, a mere two months later. Several social media users expressed their views too on the speed at which Catherine had taken the marital plunge, with many commenting that it seemed too short a time for such a serious commitment. One person said: Everyone talking about what heaposs wearing but Iaposm thinking how a couple of MONTHS before her wedding she didnapost wanna fall in love… Another suggested the images from the wedding day did not show a beaming bride, saying: Sheaposs not exactly giving happy in love vibes tbf. A third added: Okay but his outfit aside, sis donapost even look happy. Despite the whirlwind romance already drawing some critical comments, many users took more umbrage with the groom’s chosen outfit - and didn’t hold back when sharing their thoughts on the matter. One person asked: Did he not know he was getting married  Another joked: Wedding at . Wetherspoons with the ladsapos at .

She keeps warm by running with her dog, Ben, every morning.At almost , she runs k most days, then puts on four layers to keep herself warm. Sheila, , uses a hot water bottle, burns wood in her fireplace, and at night she uses several duvets. She eats mainly leftovers which she stretches out for days. She spent her le working as a flight attendant, a legal assistant and in a car showroom, only to have what she calls an “uncomfortable” retirement. “I have worked and paid into the system my whole le,” says Sheila, who was widowed  years ago.“It’s sad to be living in this state. The Government has no idea how the other half live. My pension is just pocket money for Boris.”Mike Wagstaff, , from Worksop, Notts, works in BQ Warehouse. His we works for the NHS.“My we is at home on sick leave, but she can’t put the heating on, she just wraps up like an Eskimo,” he says. “We have the heating on for two hours a night, as soon as the house is warm, we get straight into bed. “We’ll need an extra £ to pay for bills and council tax from April. We’ve already made a lot of cutbacks, but we will have to stop visiting family. I can’t even remember the last time I went out. It is no longer, ‘you live to work’, it is now ‘you work to live’.”  A mum from Wincanton in Somerset, who had to use foodbanks this summer to feed her children, said her family were having to limit time in the shower. “On the wages I am on it’s already very dficult to get by,” she says. “I’m watching my kids outgrow their clothes and we’re constantly looking for second-hand ones. “I can’t take them on days out, we have to limit time in the shower and they have to put extra clothes on so we keep the heating bills down. With inflation and gas bills going up,my wages stay this low, we’re going to be in real trouble.”These are just three people out of millions in the UK already struggling with the cost of living. Yet, as we fight our way out of the pandemic and the Government fails to deliver a fair Brexit, living costs from food prices to fuel bills are now rising even higher and faster.

On Saturday, thousands of people will take to the streets in over  locations across Britain from Bangor to Birmingham, Eastbourne to Edinburgh, Lancaster to London, and Derry to Derby. Further demonstrations are planned for March  and April . Protests were organised by the People’s Assembly at news that from April ,  million households will see an annual increase of £ on their energy bills, with even more for those on pre-payment meters. Some of the most vulnerable customers will see an astronomic increase from £, to £, a year. In the same moment, Shell posted profits of £. billion. On Wednesday, the Mirror reported BP bosses saying they didn’t know what to do with all their billions .The rise in energy bills comes on top of Chancellor Rishi Suna ’s hike in National Insurance and cut to the £ uplt in Universal Credit, rising inflation, an increase in Council Tax and higher food and rent costs. Yet the multi-millionaire Chancellor’s only solution has been to take £ off people’s energy bills – which must be paid back further down the line. Mr Sunak’s advisers include the controversial economist Tim Leunig, who has proposed that workers in northern towns should “accept lower wages”. Meanwhile, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England and on an eye-watering salary of half a million pounds a year, wants to see pay restraint for workers at a time when inflation is set to hit .% and workers face what the TUC have called the worst pay squeeze in  years. Gary Smith, general secretary of the GBM union, described Bailey’s comments as a “sick joke”. Meanwhile, Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite the Union, asked: “Why is it that every time there is a crisis, rich men ask ordinary people to pay for it ” She adds: “This crisis was not caused by working people and we are not going to take wage cuts to pay for it. Why should the public always bail out the markets and policy makers ”  Mike Wagstaff, a Unite member, echoes her disbelief: “The system is extremely broken,” he says. “The Government gives with one hand and takes with another. “Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would end up living like this when I’ve worked since I was .” Pensioner Sheila, who contacted Age UK for support, says the cost of living is making her isolated. She’s stopped having cake with friends. “I’m active, but there are people who are ill, and they should be able to heat their homes and eat properly, it is a disgrace,” she says. “We shouldn’t be living penny to penny.” Yet costs are about to go radically upwards. “Well, we won’t be able to live,” Sheila says. “Prices for even the cheapest tin of soup have doubled in price. To buy a piece of meat or fish, you need to take a mortgage out. “It’s not right, people of our age need basic nutrition. We could be sitting there in a chair with hypothermia.

One of the highlighted alterations has been for drivers to give priority in certain situations to pedestrians or cyclists, reported Leicestershire Live.Traffic now has to cede the right of way to pedestrians who are, or who are about to begin, crossing at a junction. The changes have been controversial with claims it will encourage pedestrians to walk into the road recklessly and lead to an increase in collisions.  But others say the new rules will encourage motorists to be more conscious of pedestrians crossing the road. Clearly on one busy road in Leicester there was little change when a Leicester Live reporter went to see on Narborough Road whether drivers would give way to him at two junctions. Choosing Harrow Road and Gaul Street he would look to cross the road as a car was indicating to turn into it and seethey stopped to let me proceed.  But during a period of  minutes at the two junctions, only one driver spotted him and let him cross before they turned in. The restall drove into the junction without stopping. It turned into a dangerous exercise with vehicles not giving way and forcing the reporter to run to avoid being hit. The exercise suggests that there has been little change despite the introduction of the new Highway Code with people either unaware of the alterations or choosing to ignore them.  It would seem to be dangerous at this stage for pedestrians to simply walk out in front of traffic eventhey do have the right of way. In total, nine sections of the Highway Code have been updated, with  rules added or amended. The changes are advisory at this time, so non-compliance will not result in a fine. When it comes to crossing the road at junctions, there have been three amendments made to the Highway Code. As reported on the government website the new rules state:When people are crossing or waiting to cross at a junction, other traffic should give way. If people have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, the people crossing have priority and the traffic should give way. People driving, riding a motorcycle or cycling must give way to people on a zebra crossing and people walking and cycling on a parallel crossing.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vehicles\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Speaking on his podcast The Good, The Bad and The Rugby, Mike admitted: I text Ellis and said ‘mate, please tell me anything she messed up on’ so I could sort of, family WhatsApp group, get into her.  “And he said ‘No she was actually pretty good, and she was really good at kicking’ and I was like…” Mike proceeded to give a large sigh and added: But she has this competitive nature where she has to be good at things.” His co-presenter Alex Payne agreed, saying: “She looked unbelievably natural.” And Mike added: Just imagine, anyone who’s ever tried it, getting thrown up in the line-outyou’ve never done it before is not easy because normally, you’ll kick the prop in either the nuts or the face as he’s lting you and she just looked effortless.”Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Gregorz Ewiak, , broke into the victimaposs home by crashing through the living room window and later threatened to kill her, it was claimed. Like a horror movie, blood was discovered on the TV, walls, carpets and door handles which revealed Ewiakaposs DNA, the prosecution said.When the terrying ordeal was over, he sent her a text threatening to take away her children, aged two and seven, reports Liverpool Echo.A judge told Ewiak his actions must have left the victim and her children absolutely petried.Liverpool Crown Court was told the female victim was at her home in Birchwood, Warrington, on October  last year.Ewiak, of Dagenham, London, was subject to bail conditions at the time, with an overnight home curfew due to extradition proceedings.  But the mum heard banging on her front door at around pm, before her living room window was smashed. She rushed upstairs, collected her children from their bedrooms and locked them in the bathroom with her. Prosecutor Jonathan Rogers said: She could then hear people in her home and she heard someone shout aposIaposm going to kill youapos in Polish. She didnapost recognise the voice but someone allegedly started banging on the bathroom door trying to get in. Neighbours called the police and the two intruders left the scene, the court heard. When officers arrived, they found the front door lock was broken, with the key snapped in the lock. Mr Rogers said they discovered large amounts of blood by the living room window and smeared throughout the property which revealed Ewiakaposs DNA. The prosecutor said the woman told a social worker Ewiak had confronted her a few weeks earlier suspecting she was having a relationship with a next-door neighbour. Ewiak was arrested and interviewed - but made no comment. He admitted burglary with intent to cause damage and criminal damage, after a charge of making threats to kill was dropped by the crown. Mr Rogers said Ewiakaposs victim concluded a statement by saying she is scared of the defendant because he is crazy. He said: She is unsure of what he may do and she believes the safest thing for her to do is toto Poland. The victim also wrote a letter to the court, but later said this was after being pressured into doing so, by two unknown iniduals. Recorder Ian Harris said the victim explained a letter was sent to the court in my name requesting a lenient sentence for Mr Ewiak and said the letter was made under duress. Ewiak has four previous convictions including theft in  and advertising prostitution in . In  he was jailed for battery after assaulting a former partner. That same year he was jailed for  months in Poland for inflicting grievous bodily harm. The court heard a letter from the mum of his child described him as a good father to their daughter and there was a letter from his daughter saying how much she misses her father. Benjamin Brown, defending, asked for full one-third credit for his clientaposs early guilty pleas and said he had no knowledge of the letter sent by the victim. He said: He accepts that he clearly should never have entered the property and he does recognise the impact upon his ex-partner. Mr Brown said: His sole focus and motivation now your honour is to become a good father to his daughter, who is  years of age. He fully appreciates and keenly feels the loss to her of a father figure as a result of his actions. The lawyer said Ewiak wanted to take up a job offer at a vegetable shop. He said: The defendant wants to become a beneficial member of society moving forward and is motivated to gain employment upon his release. Reading a pre-sentence report, Recorder Harris said: He only accepted limited responsibility for his offending and he doesnapost come across as being particularly remorseful. Mr Brown suggested language barriers may have contributed to that impression. Recorder Harris said the victim and her children must have been absolutely petried when locked in the bathroom. The judge said the sight of all the blood afterwards must have added horror to the fear that the woman and the children felt. He said Ewiak travelled up from Dagenham and when he arrived at the house, it seems to me there was an explosion of temper so far as youaposre concerned. Recorder Harris jailed him for two years and four months, adding: This is without prejudice to the extradition matter that as I understand it is going through the courts. He also imposed a seven-year restraining order to protect the victim.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BirchwoodCourt caseCriminal damageCrown courtSocial workersCrimeBurglary\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lee Clark, who works in a branch of Tesco in Southend-on-Sea, says he will be giving the silent treatment to all customers and colleagues. Lee is usually noisy and chatty but his silence vow is for a very good cause. He is being sponsored to be silent while on sht to raise money for Cancer Research, British Heart Foundation, and Diabetes UK. The father-of-five started his silence at the beginning of January and will finish on April . Instead of speaking, Lee is communicating with flashcards, pens, and paper.Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Lee said: It could be quite draining because you try not to slip up and try to focus. It can be a horrible experience but, again, Iaposm lucky I can put myself in that position to help someone  and Iaposll happily do that every single time. Lee said that knowing he is doing something good for those charities gets him through it because it can be a very lonely place and can make him feel quite isolated. The Tesco worker has worked at the supermarket chain for  years, and this will be his th year doing a sponsored silence. He first decided to remain silent after being referred to as the singing man on the tills.  Lee raised £ for the Lennox Lewis Cancer Fund in that very first nine-hour silent sht. It was phenomenal because Iaposve never done anything like that in my le before, so it really got me. He said, It gave me the bug for fundraising as well. I just saw the response as well as the love and support it brought. Lee explained that people would come into his branch of Tesco to see him be silent and donate to the bucket, saying it was a brilliant experience. I saw the dference it makes to people and thataposs what I never experienced before. Youaposre helping someone and theyaposre helping you, there is no better feeling than that. He added: I love giving. Lee has participated and organised in over  charity events in the last  years, raising around £, for  dferent charities.  Tesco is very supportive of Leeaposs fundraising and supports his challenge on its social media s. He also believes it provides a sense of fun and laughter to his colleagues and shoppers. While working, Lee hangs a board around his neck to explain what he is doing and who he is raising money for. Itaposs my th one, so itaposs quite an achievement in that sense and no one gets bored of it. They love me being quiet.  But, some people think at first they heaposs being rude but quickly change their minds when they see the sign. Lee says this fundraising event is his worst one compared to others heaposs participated in because he gets frustrated that he canapost talk.  It is the worst thing in the world when you just want to blurt out and join in their conversation, he said. After his sht is over, he is happy to be able to speak because he loves talking. In addition to his sponsored silence, Lee will also be running the London Marathon and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro this year to raise money for charity. Anything you raise is something more than you had yesterday, so it doesnapost matter what you raise, Lee added.

The Duke is facing a civil jury trial later this year in New York after the law suit was filed.  He denies any wrongdoing.Ms Gruenbaum told the Sun : I don’t want to sit by and not speak out about the way he was towards me as he calls Virginia delusional.She also claimed Andrew insisted on being naked apart from his own towels and demanded the full body massages were carried out in his bedroom despite her objections.  And alleged within minutes of their first session asked her about her sex le. Ms Gruenbaum was a sports massage therapist in Surrey when she started treating the Dukeaposs ex-we Sarah Ferguson in  - who in turn recommended Andrew get in touch. She said she was not vetted by staff at Buckingham Palace - as far as she knew - and had six sessions with Andrew from that summer.  She had several high-profile clients but said Andrew was very dferent from the start. Ms Gruenbaum said she was called and invited by the Dukeaposs secretary to the Lodge on a Sunday afternoon, which was unusual. She claimed she arrived for the session at around pm but rather than use her own table, was told she must use one of Andrewaposs.  After being led by a staff member to a master bedroom she claimed she said she was not really comfortable and complained the table was too high and would mean massaging at boob level. Ms Gruenbaum was allegedly told not to make a fuss before she heard Andrew say behind her: Hey nice a****. Do you take it up the a***   She said she turned to find the prince eyeball to eyeball with her and the atmosphere became really weird - with the Duke making constant anal sex jokes and asking when she last had sex. For each of the half a dozen sessions they had, Andrew’s office sent cheques to Ms Gruenbaum’s home address including a compliment slip from the Duke. The visits were almost weekly for two months and then she stopped getting calls from his staff to make appointments. “Every time I saw him he would try to overstep the line, she said. His advances weren’t working and I think that his patience ran out.

Tens of thousands are still coming down with the virus every day and, just as Charles will hope he has not passed it on to the Queen, they too will worry about spreading it. So Boris Johnson must explain why he unilaterally decided to bring forward the end of all Covid restrictions. One member of SAGE has said they were blindsided by the decision even though it has implications for millions of people’s health. It is also noticeable that neither the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Chris Whitty, nor the Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, have said whether they approve of the PM’s actions. People will rightly ask whether the Prime Minister is acting in the national interest or out of political expediency.  Fools rush in Everything must be done to prevent Russia from carrying out its threat to invade Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is playing a reckless and risky game by massing an estimated , Russian troops on the country’s border. The response from the West must be resolute and united. But there is a fine line between taking a firm stance against Russian aggression and inflaming an already delicate situation. Boris Johnson’s overblown rhetoric yesterday risked crossing that line. President Putin is deliberately testing the resolve of the West. Forcing him to back down requires careful and well-calibrated diplomacy, not cavalier comments and photo opportunities designed to distract attention from domestic troubles.

Palace doctors will now test the Queen frequently after she saw her son at her Windsor Castle home on Tuesday, it is understood. The Prince of Wales, , is self isolating at home after testing positive after a routine test this morning, forcing him to pull out of a joint engagement in Winchester with we Camilla. Aides confirmed the future king was “not experiencing strong symptoms”, but the Duchess of Cornwall revealed he was finding the situation “a bit tiresome”. It is the second time the heir to the throne has contracted the virus, first doing so in March  when he had mild symptoms and lost his sense of smell and taste.Riding solo for a series of meetings today Camilla said she was feeling “lucky” to have not caught the virus. The Queen has been triple-vaccinated so will not need to self isolate, unless she tests positive. She received her first jab in January  and her second jab in March while sources say it is believed she got her booster jab in October. Buckingham Palace aides said they would not comment on the Queen’s personal health, but a palace source said “obviously the situation will be closely monitored”. The Queen is understood to be “feeling much better” recently after regaining her health after a torrid few months. She was forced to spend the night in hospital in October after receiving treatment for an unexplained condition.  Doctors ordered her to take a period of rest after she completed a relentless schedule of  engagements in as many days. The monarch then missed the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in London in November after spraining her back.Throughout the pandemic, the Queen has largely been shielded by a ring of steel dubbed ‘HMS Bubble’, whereby  royal staff sacriced their home lives to stay isolated at Windsor Castle so they could serve the Queen and her late husband Prince Philip during lockdown.A year later, in April , strict Covid regulations meant the Queen was forced to wear a mask and sit alone as she attended husband Prince Philip’s funeral. In recent weeks she has been enjoying her freedom after making a trip to Sandringham, her Norfolk estate, to mark the anniversary of her father’s death and dau of her accession to the throne on Feb . The Queen was out and about on public duties on Saturday, the eve of her record-breaking Platinum jubilee, meeting charity workers at Sandringham House - her first major public appearance in more than three months. A source close to the Queen tonight said she was “not experiencing any symptoms” but her contact with Charles was “recently enough to be relevant”. The prince went to see his mother on Tuesday at Windsor Castle after awarding OBEs to chefs Fergus Henderson, who has Parkinson’s Disease, and his we Margot as well as an MBE to Dr Nisreen Alwan, who is known for campaigning for more awareness around long covid.On Wednesday evening he attended with Camilla a reception for the British Asian Trust with  guests, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel at the British Museum in London on Wednesday evening. The heir can be released from his isolationhe tests negative on day  and day  and does not have a temperature. The triple-vaccinated prince was said to be “deeply disappointed” to have to pull out of engagements in Winchester after his positive test on Thursday. When he contracted covid for the first time last March he said he ”got away with it quite lightly” before spending seven days in self-isolation at his Birkhall home in Scotland before resuming his duties.Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson wished the prince a “speedy recovery”.On a solo visit to the Thames Valley Partnership in Buckinghamshire, Camilla said she was lucky not to be positive herself.  Speaking to Willie Hartley Russell, high sherf for Berkshire, during the visit today, she said: “He’s diagnosed now. Luckily . I’ve taken it so many times.” Mr Hartley Russell said: “It gets a bit pointless, doesn’t it ” and Camilla agreed. Speaking afterwards, he added: “She said, ‘Yes, unfortunately he had tested positive again. I said he must be building up lots of antibodies. “She said something like he’s finding it a bit tiresome to have got it again, but she said it in a light-hearted way.”  Earlier in the day, Camilla spoke for the first time to reveal her delight at the Queen’s statement on Saturday that it was her “sincere wish” that the Duchess of Cornwall be made ‘Queen Consort’ when Charles takes the throne. On a visit to the Nourish Hub community food centre in West London, Camilla was asked about how she feels about her future title. And in reply she said she was “very, very honoured” and “very touched” to receive the Queen’s backing to be a future Queen Consort.

Now Stewart, , who was already serving a le term for killing childrenaposs author Helen in  was additionally convicted yesterday of murdering we, Diane, six years earlier. His chilling intentions were uncovered too late - to the fury of many, who have askedhe could have been stopped beforehand. Stewart, , killed -year-old childrenaposs book author Helen in  and dumped her body in the cesspit of the £. million home they shared in Royston in Hertfordshire. He had secretly drugged and suffocated her in a plot to inherit her £m fortune. A trial at St Albans Crown Court heard it was most likely she was suffocated while sedated by drugs, and Stewart was found guilty of her murder in .  His conviction prompted police to reopen their investigation into the death of his we, Diane Stewart,  - and crucial evidence uncovered the truth. It was originally believed that she had died from a sudden epileptic fit in the garden of the coupleaposs home in Cambridgeshire. But examinations of her brain years later uncovered the truth as brain tissue showed signs of suffocation, with prosecutors suggesting Stewart could have forced a plastic bag over her head. Now questions are being asked about why he was free to murder Helen after signs of foul play were allegedly missed in Dianeaposs death.Speaking to The , Shelley Whitehead who befriended Helen said: aposIt really raises questions about how someone so very evil could literally get away with murder, and do it again.aposDid they look at this bereaved, vulnerable father, this man whose we has aposdiedapos from an epileptic fit, the father who now has to raise his boys on his own - is he so convincing that they didnapost do the proper checks  Or was something overlooked apos  Epilepsy Questions have been raised over whether anything was missed in the original investigation of the murder of Diane Stewart. Though she had epilepsy, she hadnapost suffered a fit for  years and controlled her condition with medication. But her husband claimed he ed from a shopping trip to find her collapsed after hanging up washing. At the trial, an expert claimed her chances of suffering a fatal epileptic fit were about one in , Yet, this was originally recorded as her cause of death, with an inquest concluding she had suffered a sudden death in epilepsy , which kills about  people each year.  Coroners inquest According to the coroneraposs file that was seen by The , pathologists carried out a non-forensic post-mortem examination and recommended epilepsy as the cause of death,aposno toxicological or anatomical causeapos was found. This was reached despite no tell-tale signs of a fit, such as evidence of tongue biting or physical injuries matching the claim she had fallen onto a concrete patio, as her killer claimed. Full toxicology tests were not carried out during the examination in  - with screenings only carried out for an anti-epileptic drug. A decade on, experts found physiological changes in her brain known as ischemia as a result of suffocation, rather than the so-called epileptic fit. This could have ruled out a sudden death - as it develops over time and indicated she was unconscious for some time before her death.  CPR claims Stewartaposs claim that he performed CPR was doubted by a paramedic who found no evidence of blood or froth on his face - which there would have beenhe had attempted it. During a  call, he was instructed to perform mouth-to-mouth and claimed he was doing so, but paramedic Spencer North, who attended the scene, said there “didn’t seem to be any effective CPR”. There were also no signs of injuries caused by CPR - or even cuts or bruises on Diane, which youaposd expectsheaposd collapsed on the concrete patio as claimed. Speaking to the BBC, neighbour Vanessa Easton, a nurse, recalled arriving home and seeing Dianeaposs body.I remember thinking at the time aposthank goodness thereaposs no blood... she looks perfectapos. Speaking to the BBC yesterday, Det Supt Kent acknowledged there were suspicious factorsyou compare them to what happened to Helen Bailey. Of course we didnapost have that information or evidence at that stage, he said. At the time of Dianeaposs death there was nothing to suspect that Ian had been responsible or that she had died at his hands.

It has been a cold February so far especially for the north of the UK and it is to get colder before there is some slight respite over the weekend with milder weather, the Met Office said.The worst of the temperatures again are set to be in Scotland going into Friday as well as rural and isolated spots.Then maps from WXCharts show that there is expected to be steady snowfall throughout next week, mainly in Scotland, although some could also land in northern England during. Up to cm of snow could fall in Scotland with the heaviest in midweek and also the following weekend. Before that people will need to wrap up warm on Friday with the Met Office saying that temperatures could fall to -C in Scotland while maps from Netweather show minimum temperatures plummeting to well below freezing throughout much of the UK. Met Office Senior Operational Meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth warned temperatures are likely to plunge to -C in rural sheltered spots of Scotland.  Rural areas further south towards England, Wales and Northern Ireland could freeze in temperatures as low as -C, triggering a frosty start to Friday morning.Ms Shuttleworth told the Express : Temperatures are expected to drop to - C in rural sheltered spots of Scotland by the morning.Further south rural mins will be widely - to - C across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The cold air across the UK is moving in from the Atlantic this paired with the light winds and clear skies for many means it will be a widely frosty start to Friday. Met Office meteorologist Clare Nasir similarly painted a freezing Friday. She said: The air is turning steadily colder. The key weather feature going into Friday will be how cold it is, with a widespread frost and the risk of some ice.  Thursday into Friday, there is a driving wind. A few showers come in across west Wales and Northern Ireland, and further showers are likely across the western northern periphery of Scotland. Inland though it is going to turn really cold, bitterly cold. In the countryside, temperatures could be as low as -C to -C across the highlands of Scotland. There will be a risk of ice first thing, but most areas will get away with a dry and bright morning with some sunshine. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Odd early showers, mainly across northern Scotland, wintry here. Many other areas starting fine and frosty, then keeping plenty of sunshine. This, along with lighter winds, should make it feel less cold. Northwest UK clouding up, gales and rain later. Tonight: Southeastern areas mainly dry a few clear spells, perhaps a touch of frost. Rain and gales in northwest UK giving way to showers, as the rain sinks into central areas. Saturday: Rain turning heavier for a time across parts of southern Scotland, northwest England and Wales. Bright intervals and blustery showers further north. South and southeast England mainly dry until evening. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Unsettled mild with wind and rain on Sunday, although probably more showery for northern Scotland. Colder with sunny spells and showers on Monday, further rain arriving Tuesday after a frost.

The -year-old said she was confused why the posters hadnapost been removed. Although Olivia admits to liking some of MJaposs songs, she believes the room would put her off as it gave her bad vibes.  Three years ago the documentary Leaving Neverland, which detailed claims that Jackson sexually abused two children, was released. London-based estate agents McHugh  Co. described the terraced property as requiring modernisation but made no reference to Jacko-themed room. Olivia, from Guildford, Surrey, said: I was just browsing, seeing what was on the market, I currently rent so I was looking at house prices in my area. I found it pretty strange but quite funny. The rest of the house looks pretty run down so this one Michael Jackson room was even creepier considering the state of the place.It doesnapost look lived in so I donapost see why the estate agents wouldnapost take the creepy fan art down before taking the pictures but maybe theyaposre just trying to attract MJ fans. Iaposm not a big fan of Michael Jackson but I like some of his stuff. It would put me off, it gives me bad vibes. Itaposs both creepy and completely odd. It looks like a childaposs room.

The bear is said to have got onto the rural property, which sits in a gulch just south of wooded hills when the unnamed man took up a firearm and was startled.Josephine County Sherfaposs Office undersherf Travis Snyder said in a statement a  call was received just before am on February  to report the initial shooting in Placer Road, Sunny Valley.The area is an unincorporated community off Interstate  about  miles north of Grants Pass, reports the Oregonian. The caller reported that he had accidentally shot his brother while loading a gun because there was a bear on their property, Mr Snyder said. Upon arrival, Deputies located a deceased male from an apparent gunshot wound.  While checking the rest of the residence, a second deceased male was located with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The undersherf went on to say local detectives were being assisted by detectives from the Oregon State Police. He added: Based upon the investigation, it is believed the caller took his own le after calling  to report the accidental shooting.  This case is still under investigation and will be forwarded to the Oregon State Medical Examiner’s Office. The state in the Pacic Northwest region of the Western US is home to around , black bears, according to the Josephine County Parks Department. The department - which calls Oregon aposBlack Bear Countryapos - warns residents to avoid leaving food and litter unsecured and to slowly walk awayconfronted by a bear. It adds that bear attacks are uncommon and the animals generally avoid human contact. It remains unclear whether the bear in Placer Road was acting aggressively.

Big sauropods could have s stretching more than m, which would likely have been quite uncomfortable when suffering from a cough, breathing trouble and fever. The remains are the first evidence of respiratory infection in a non-avian dinosaur. The specimen, which has been nicknamed aposDollyapos, was discovered in Montana in  and dates back to the Late Jurassic Period, around  million years ago. Cary Woodruff and colleagues from the Great Plains Dinosaur Museum in Montana looked at three bones from Dollyaposs neck and found never-before-seen abnormal bony protrusions.  Each bone, which had an unusual shape and texture, would have been attached to air-filled structures, known as air sacs. These connected to the lungs and formed part of the dinosauraposs respiratory system.Scans of unusual protrusions on the bone suggest that they most likely formed in response to an infection. Part of the abstract of the study reads: While we cannot pinpoint the specic infectious agent that caused the airsacculitis, this diagnosis establishes the first fossil record of this disease. Additionally, it allows us increased insight into the medical disorders of dinosaurs from a phylogenetic perspective and understanding what maladies plagued the aposfearfully great lizardsapos.  The scientists have wagered that Dolly was suffering from a fungal infection similar to aspergillosis, a common respiratory illness that affects birds and reptiles. They believe itaposs possible that Dolly died as a result of the infection. Given the likely symptoms this animal suffered from, holding these infected bones in your hands, you canapost help but feel sorry for Dolly, said Woodruff. Weaposve all experienced these same symptoms — coughing, trouble breathing, a fever, etc. — and hereaposs a -million-year-old dinosaur that likely felt as miserable as we all do when weaposre sick.Slightly closer to home, two years ago a visitor to Penarth beach in Glamorgan found what is now believed to be the extremely rare footprints of a dinosaur from more than  million years ago. Scientists have now revealed they believe the extremely rare tracks come from a time when the supercontinent Pangea was still intact. Initially, the tracks were thought to be part of the geological process of the beach and scientists were sceptical about them being footprints. But further evaluation indicated they were dinosaur tracks from the late Triassic period which is when dinosaurs began to reign supreme on Earth. Paul Barrett, anthropology palaeobiologist at the museum and co-author of the study, said in a statement: We believed the impressions we saw at Penarth were consistently spaced to suggest an animal walking. These types of tracks are not particularly common worldwide, so we believe this is an interesting addition to our knowledge of Triassic le in the U.K. Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DinosaursMuseums\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. The programme details the story of Shimon Hayut, a man accused of using the dating app to con people out of an estimated £. million.Hayut allegedly matched with women on Tinder under the alias Simon Leviev and told them he was the son of Israeli diamond tycoon Lev Leviev. Tinder confirmed they had closed his account on Friday– but it was reported that he was still active on the app when the documentary was released earlier last week. This report left Alaw fuming, claiming she was being treated worse than the Tinder Swindler.“I think it’s all a joke after watching the show on Netflix and he was still able to be on the app when his purpose was to use it for criminal activity – whereas all I wanted was to go for a drink with someone, she said.Alaw, who has , Instagram followers , claims she was first banned from Tinder in September  and again in December  after getting her account back.She was also allegedly booted from Hinge in March  and claims to have been kicked off Bumble in . I had problems with a couple of my pictures so I’d just replace them with others, she explained. “I would never post anything offensive but it’s hard to find a picture of myself wearing clothes when  per cent of my pictures are in lingerie or swimwear due to my work.” The model has pleaded with the apps to provide a reason for her accounts being blocked but claims she has not received a reply. Alaw said: “It’s always the same old automated response. I know I wasn’t nasty to anyone on there, I didn’t do anything criminal on there, I was well-behaved so it’s got to be something like they think it’s a fake account or someone has too much time on their hands and keeps reporting me for some bizarre reason. “I genuinely think it’s someone bitter that reports me or they somehow manage to associate me with OnlyFans and think I used the s for advertising purposes or sold subscriptions on there when I genuinely never [would] – I actually want to date!” The model goes on to say that she has even offered to send proof of identication to the apps but claims her messages have been ignored. She added: “I wouldn’t mindthey replied like ‘look Alaw your behaviour was that appalling you aren’t allowed on the app anymore’, but I know I didn’t do anything to breach guidelines so that’s why I want an answer. “They usually refer to the terms and conditions which state that they can remove you without explanation – which is the easy way out for them.” With her dating app woes leaving her single for Valentine’s Day, Alaw plans to mark the holiday by treating herself to a Chinese takeaway instead of a romantic dinner for two. “I would like to date again, I haven’t for a while due to not being on Tinder. I think I am just having to find a way of getting dates without dating apps from now on, she admitted.

The situation in the country has been described as one of the worst European crises in decadesDesna military training centre where Ukraine soldiers take part in training exercises with the use of the British-supplied NLAW Image: Andy Commins   Daily MirrorByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb |commentsBoris Johnson has warned tensions in Ukraine will reach a “dangerous moment” in the coming days with Russia on the brink of doing something “disastrous”.The Prime Minister travelled to Brussels and Poland in a show of support to his Nato allies describing the situation as “one of the worst European crises in decades”. Russia has denied it plans to invade Ukraine but has massed troops on the border and has carried out army exercises as it flexes its military muscles.As many as , Russian and local troops began “exercises” less than  miles from the Belarusian border to the north.Meanwhile, up to , Russian troops are on Ukraine’s eastern flank, backed by , pro-Moscow separatists in contested Donbas.  Standing alongside Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels today, Mr Johnson said: “The stakes are very high and this is a very dangerous moment. “At stake are the rules that protect every nation - big and small.” But he insisted Britain has an “absolute” and “immovable” commitment to bolstering Europe’s security.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged her controversial Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to pull troops back from Ukraine’s border to ease tensions.Ms Truss’s visit to Moscow was the first by a Foreign Secretary in four years, with the relationship between the UK and Russia severely strained by incidents including the  Salisbury nerve agent attack. She said: “There is still time for Russia to end its aggression towards Ukraine and pursue the path of diplomacy.  “But Nato is very clear thatthat path is not chosen there will be severe consequences for Russia, Ukraine and the whole of Europe.” But Mr Lavrov rejected Ms Truss’s call for forces to pull back. “The demands to remove the Russian troops from the Russian territory cause regret. “We don’t want to threaten anyone. It’s us who are facing threats.” Ms Truss’s diplomatic efforts appeared to have failed as Mr Lavrov likened their conversations to “the mute with the deaf” and he accused UK diplomats of coming “unprepared” to their crunch talks.  Labour leader Keir Starmer had also travelled to Brussels for talks with Nato chiefs, the first Labour leader to do so in more than a decade. Mr Starmer seeks to re-establish the party’s relationship with Nato after his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn called for the alliance to be disbanded.He lashed out at Mr Corbyn and said he was “wrong” on Nato and insisted his party’s commitment is now “unshakeable”. Distancing himself from his predecessor’s views, he said: “Jeremy Corbyn had a very dferent view, he was wrong about that and I spoke out at the time about that.”  Mr Corbyn had described Nato as a “major problem and a major dficulty” before becoming leader of the Labour Party - but never made it party policy to withdraw.Mr Starmer later launched a fierce attack on the Stop the War coalition, in which Mr Corbyn is a leading figure, accusing it of siding with Russia against Nato. In an opinion article for the , he described the group as “naive” at best before adding Putin’s regime would see the group as “virtue signallers” who were “providing a smokescreen so it can go on beating up and jailing those brave iniduals that dare to stand up to its despotism on the streets of Russia”.

Kyan Pennell died on January  when he got caught between a trailer and a gate at his family’s property in Tuchekoi, southeast of Gympie, Queensland.According toYahoo News , the family was left heartbroken.Kyan, who had a passion for classical music, was teaching himself classical piano in the months before his death - and unbeknownst to his parents, had started writing his own composition. Now, after finding an unfinished song in a blank notebook, his mother Amanda Bierley has started a campaign to bring his music to le ahead of his funeral - scheduled to take place on Sunday.She never got to hear his piece, but has appealed to musicians on Facebook to play what he has written and send the family a recording. In a post on Facebook, she said that Kyan was composing a piece which he had categorised as a “modern classical”. I never heard what he was composing. Is there anyone that can read music and play it and send it to us ” she asked. “It would mean the world to us to hear his composition. Kyan had wanted to be a concert pianist, Amanda said and had spent “every waking hour” on the piano he scraped and saved to buy. Speaking on BC radio, Amanda said the family was hoping the finished piece could offer “just a little insight” into Kyan’s mind. She said Kyan was “so much more than the way he died”, and said she wanted people to remember him for who he was in his short  years - “full of le, with a beautul mind”. In a tribute on Facebook, she said: He was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD and used that superpower to become an incredibly beautul and unique human who just wanted to learn and excel at everything he could, about everything there was.  Piano was his calling, he was , and had  months of learning, teaching himself music theory, performance and composition.” He had committed multiple classical pieces to memory, she said, as well as some modern pieces. However, she claimed he had only learned the modern pieces to lure in new listeners and educate them with the beauty of classical music. Amanda carried on to appeal for musicians to complete the music as Kyan had intended, with “repeated bits, a changed tempo and with light and shade”. He imagined it to be performed by wind and string instruments, and of course his beloved piano, she continued on Facebook. He would have been so chuffed that all these wonderful people are now playing his music. Little did he know he was actually composing his own funeral song.” Amanda’s Facebook post has attracted hundreds of responses and shares. The family have received some “lovely renditions”, Amanda said, but she continued to encourage anyone to contribute to his “beautul unfinished work” and hopes more come through before his funeral. She said she was “extremely humbled” by people’s responses, which had helped him see “beauty through adversity”. According to ABC reports, Kyan’s song would be performed and recorded by  members of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, with the aim of having it complete for Sunday’s funeral.Meanwhile, a GoFundMe campaign has been launched by a family friend to help the beautul Pennell family out during this dficult time.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ADHDAustralia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Authorities are now trying to uncover how the -year-old died after discovering his body while his injured son, , was being treated and taken to hospital. Officials believe the unnamed OAP has been dead for around  months. His son Jose Manuel Cobos, , is still at Madrid’s Puerta de Hierro Hospital after suffering a ruptured spleen, head injuries, several crushed vertebrae and a broken hip.Police have been told they must wait untill he is better to be able to question him. Landlords were understood to have been conducting the eviction after Jose and his dad failed to pay the rent on the flat in Palafox Street in the town of Mostoles, a -minute drive south-west of the centre of Madrid, where Joseaposs third-floor plunge led to the macabre find. Neighbours told investigators the last time they saw the OAP was in the summer of  but local reports say the former construction worker was still withdrawing his dad’s pension every month. Jose had gone to live with his dad after a breakup with an ex who had reported him for non-payment of maintenance following their orce, Spanish daily El Mundo reported. The lawyer of the injured man’s unnamed ex, Alberto Martin, told the paper: “When he’s discharged from hospital he’ll be questioned by a judge and will have to explain what happened to his father.” Forensic tests to determine whether the OAP died of natural causes are understood have been carried out, with police still awaiting the results. Confirming he had cut himself off from the outside world and cut ties from his two siblings after the split, Mr Martin added: “His ex-we and daughter have been very patient and waited seven or eight years before filing an official complaint. “It was when we went to put in a civil claim that the police told us he’d jumped from the window of his dad’s house in Mostoles.

Ashmi, , and Diwakar, , speak to Sherpas who reveal how Everest is changing before their eyes... Few places on the planet can match the awe-inspiring beauty of the Himalayas, home to nine out of  of the world’s highest peaks.The mountain range is the natural world at its finest and most challenging, but beneath the shadows of Mount Everest is frightening evidence of the impact that the climate emergency is having on our planet.Sherpas of Nepal today warn how glaciers on Mount Everest are rapidly melting, making traversing the peak more dangerous and putting the lives of the people living below the mountain at risk. Kami Rita Sherpa, the world record holder for the most ascents to the summit of Everest, says that he is concerned about the future of the world’s highest peak as rising temperatures are causing glaciers and snow to disappear at alarming rates. “All the mountains are melting,” the Sherpa, who has reached the top of Mount Everest  times, says. “And the weather at the mountains is very unpredictable. Mountains are starting to be bare, as the once snow-covered rocks are only rocks now.”Photographs taken of Everest in May  and January  from the Tibet side of the mountain show a stark dference. In , scientists monitoring climate change in the region found the average melting rate has doubled over the past decade due to higher temperatures and decreased snowfall. Apa Sherpa, a former world record holder who ascended Everest  times before his retirement, witnessed the mountain disappearing before his own eyes.  “There was a big change compared to when I first climbed and my last climb,” he says. “When I first climbed, there was more snow and more ice, but it’s a lot more rocky now because of climate change.” He adds: “The glacier is getting lower and lower because it’s melting.” For Sherpas like Kami and Apa, who are charged with guiding tourists and carrying their equipment to the top of the ,-metre peak, global warming is making the climb even more dangerous. Without snow and ice holding rocks in place, Kami says “natural disasters like rockfalls and avalanches occur more frequently than in the old days.”  Apa recalls climbing in the s without a helmet but now mountaineers have to wear helmets because of the falling rocks. Climate campaigner Pemba Dorje Sherpa, who has also summited Everest  times and campaigns with Friends of the Earth, explains that one of the riskiest parts of the mountain is the notorious Khumbu icefall. An icefall is a steep part of a glacier, similar to a frozen waterfall. The Khumbu icefall is located above Everest’s base camp and is considered one of the most treacherous parts of the route to the top. In April , a column of ice collapsed there, causing an avalanche that killed  Sherpas.  “It’s getting riskier with increased climate change and global warming as the ice there melts because of the heat,” Pemba says. “Earlier, we used to start the climb at  to  am. Now, we have to start around  am to cross the iceberg before sunrise to avoid the risk of it melting.” A research team measuring ice temperatures on the Khumbu Glacier in  found that the ice was signicantly warmer than expected, with the coldest ice measuring -.°C – meaning it will be quicker to melt in the sun. As the snow melts, Sherpas have been horried to see bodies of past climbers emerging.  An estimated  people have died on Everest, a third of whom are Sherpas. “It is dangerous for every climber but the sherpas are the ones that take huge risks,” Kami says, explaining that they are responsible for “opening the routes ,carrying loads and preparing for the clients.” He adds: “Nobody recognizes the responsibility and the struggles that Sherpas face during the expedition.” But unlike Western tourists seeking adventure, many Sherpas have no choice but to make the climb in order to earn a wage to feed their families. Nepal’s mountain tourist industry contributed millionto the economy in . “I wanted to get an education and become a doctor,” Apa says. “But unfortunately when I was , my father passed away. Then I had no choice, I had to support my family. So then I became a porter and trekking guide.”  Kami also became a mountaineer out of necessity rather than choice. “I had the responsibility of looking after my family and was not very financially stable at that moment. Being from a poor family background, the only source of income was mountaineering.” Apa says: “Our Sherpa people, we have no education. So we have to climb, even though it’s risky. That’s why more of our people die on Everest than the Western people, the European people.  “Because the Sherpas have no choice and the Sherpas have to do everything - fixing the ropes, taking the clients to the top, bringing them down, we have to go through the icefall - times.” The people living in Everest’s foothills are also suffering the effects of the melting mountain. Pemba says that people in his community live in fear of the nearby lakes bursting as they fill with melted ice from the glaciers. “If the Tsho Rolpa lake bursts, my village will be swept away in  minutes,” he says. The lake, which is one of Nepal’s largest glacial lakes, sits at an altitude of , metres.  Although the government has taken steps to prevent it from bursting, there is still a risk of an outburst. Apa recalls his own home being destroyed by a glacial lake flood in . “One of the lakes nearby my house burst. Everything was gone. Not only my land, but all my neighbour’s too. “All the land is gone. We don’t know how many people died in the lowlands, how many animals died in the lowlands, we never knew.”  Bursting lakes have become more of a threat in recent years. In , scientists found marked acceleration in the rate of lake growth on top of glaciers across the Everest region. Three years prior, Nepal’s army drained Imja Lake near Everest after the water reached dangerously high levels from rapid glacial-melt.Waste and rubbish from climbing expeditions also ends up in these lakes as the ice melts, contaminating drinking water. Apa established the Eco-Everest expedition in , which attempts to help clean the mountain of rubbish left by former climbers. In , the group held their biggest clean-up, gathering  empty oxygen bottles from the peak, some of which had been there since the s. “Human waste was on the mountain everywhere,” Apa remembers, “but as the snow melts and the water comes down, the people who live in the lowlands have to drink the water.” Despite the risks, adventure-seekers continue to trek to the world’s tallest peak – between  to , more than , climbers attempted to summit Everest. A  video went viral as it showed a traffic jam forming at the bottom of the Khumbu icefall, with hundreds of climbers queuing to ascend the mountain. But as the climate emergency worsens, Sherpas are worried about the future of their mountain and the ever-growing dangers of climbing it. “If we do not seek climate justice now, everything will be finished,” Pemba says. The Daily Mirror’s NextGen International project builds on the success of our UK initiative, where we gave young people a voice and published the stories that matter to them. Now the project has gone global, focusing on the climate emergency and empowering young people in six countries to tell their stories of how they have been affected by the crisis.Countries taking part in the project are Nigeria, Nicaragua, the Solomon Islands, Brazil, Nepal and Mongolia.The project was originally working with a group of six teenagers in Kabul, Afghanistan, with our charity partner Save the Children. Midway through the project in August, Kabul fell to the Taliban and it was no longer safe for the young people to continue. Afghanistan was chosen because it is one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world.It is hugely regrettable the project was unable to complete in the country but the safety of the young people involved was paramount. The Mirror was awarded funding from the European Development Journalism Grants, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  “And there will be nothing left for the next generation. If this continues, our grandchildren won’t see the mountains.” Rachel Kennerley, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, adds: “Natural wonders like The Himalayas have awe-struck people since time immemorial. It’s hard to imagine a world where they don’t exist, but sites such as these are increasingly threatened by unchecked climate breakdown. “Sadly, it’s not just landscapes which could be lost, but also the rich history attached to them, the culture entwined with their existence, and the lives and livelihoods that rely on them thriving. “Halting the worst of climate breakdown is still within bounds. The world’s leaders could learn so much from the natural world in overcoming adversity and achieving the seemingly impossible, which is everything Everest has come to symbolise.”To find out how you can help, visit www.savethechildren.org.uk how-you-can-help emergencies climate-crisis Save the Children in Nepal has been implementing the ‘Red Alert’ campaign on climate change since .Under the project, Save the Children has been working with child and youth champions to understand their views and perceptions on climate change and to document their suggestions for the development of applications, websites, and project activities.

They need confidence, they need support, and to have done this in this way, I think Sadiq Khan is completely wrong.“It will leave a void at the top as opposed to a properly managed handover, which is no way to run a service like this.”Her accusations were rejected by sources close to the mayor, who said Dame Cressida had agreed to carry on serving for a “short period” to allow an orderly transition.It is understood Dame Cressida was called to a meeting with the mayor at .pm on Thursday over the reforms, but declined to attend and offered her resignation instead, catching the Home Office by surprise.Home Secretary Priti Patel was said to have been angered by Mr Khan’s failure to inform her of his intention to request a meeting with the commissioner, which she considered “rude and unprofessional”.We must urgently rebuild Londoners’ trust in the Met and root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exist.To do that, change must start from the very top.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it - with  minutes remaining to end the match as a contest, giving the score line a harsh look from a Pupils# perspective, having competed well with their lofty opponents for an hour of the contest.And while such defeats are always tough for a team#s players and management, they still offer valuable on-field experience for the young Pupils players in the squad, as they adjust to a higher, more physically demanding level of football in the West of Scotland FL.The Pupils have nine fixtures left to play this season – five at home and four away – and are on the road again tomorrowagainst second-placed Finnart FC, at Springburn Park.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

This includes extensive information provided on the building’s energy and sustainability, which led to planning permission being granted.\"We have committed to providing a low carbon and sustainable nursery building in a - learning campus that supports the local community and provides a healthy and resilient natural environment for the future. This is in line with our Climate Change Strategy.“The development will offer learners, staff and the community all the benefits of moving from an older, much less energy-efficient building to a new, more sustainable, high-quality, purpose-built facility with multiple access routes to encourage sustainable travel.“The nursery building’s orientation within that campus of north  south is also very important. The main building access is orientated to the south from Old Haddington Road to allow ease of access for those with additional support needs, as well as addressing the close relationship to the main primary school building, of which the nursery is a part.“Energy efficiency has been considered carefully throughout the building’s design and specication and we aim to combine this with sustainable building practices and reduce emissions where possible throughout the construction.”The new nursery, which will have capacity for  children over two sessions, has an open-plan design, with a mezz- anine area and separate quiet room.The contract value of the nursery is £. million, with a further £, due to be spent on internal fittings.North of the site, a three-classroom extension for secondary-school pupils is being built on the south-west side of North Berwick High School.This £. million project, due to be completed next autumn, will house new home economics, modern languages and social studies classrooms for the high school."},{"url":null,"title":"get-5-odeon-tickets-25-start-march","story":"Tickets for theatres can be quite expensive, butyou plan to go to Odeon there is a discount available.Groupon is currently offering two tickets for £, or  you want to get a group together, you can get five tickets for £.The discount on tickets will not valid for Odeon Luxe cinemas however.If you want to go to one of Odeons Luxe cinemas a deal is still available at Groupon with two tickets for £ and five for £.\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Odeon tickets are available in bundles at Groupon \" class\"editor-image\"Odeon tickets are available in bundles at GrouponThe tickets are available nationwide in  participating Odeon locations and theres no booking fee.Shoppers have got until March ,  to claim their bargain cinema ticket, and it can only be redeemed online on the Odeon website.The fine print states that there is a purchase limit of two or five per person, and the voucher is only valid for standard D screenings.Currently , plus people have already made use of the five tickets for £ deal, whilst over , plus have gone for the two tickets for £ deal.If you fancy adding to that tally, you can go to the Groupon website here to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-credit-child-benefit-pension---full-list-benefits-rising-april-2022","story":"Universal Credit, child benefit and statutory pension are among the payments that will be increased in April to keep up with the rising cost of living.Benefits will usually go up each year to keep up with inflation and in April claimants will see a .% rise in payments.The increase in payments comes as the energy price cap is set to rise by % and UK households will have to live on tighter budgets as everyday costs continue to rise.Here is how much benefits will rise in April .Standard allowanceExtra amounts for childrenLimited capability to workIf you are deemed to have limited capability to work the additional amount will rise from £. to £..If you are deemed to have limited capability to work or work-related activity the additional amount will rise from £. to £..Carer support for Universal Credit claimantsThe amount carers will get will rise from £. to £..Increased work allowanceHigher work allowancefor UC claimants with one or more dependants or limited capability to work with rise from £ to £.Lower work allowance for UC claimants with one or more dependants or limited capability to work with rise from £ to £.Single personLone parentCoupleOtherDependant aged under  – rise from £. to £.People who are retired on a low income will be topped up with Pension Credit.For single retirees it will rise from £. per week to £., for couples it will increase from £. to £..Attendance Allowance helps with extra costsyou have a disability severe enough that you need someone to help look after you.It’s paid at  dferent rates and how much you get depends on the level of care that you need because of your disability.You can claim Carer’s Allowanceyou care for someone at least  hours a week and they get certain benefits.In April, the rate will increase from £. to £. each week.The Disability Living Allowance is being replaced by Personal Independence Paymentfor disabled people.You can only apply for DLAyoure under .

highlight the project, amid concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over  years, leaving the South Esk between Dalkeith and its junction with the North Esk effectively dead and useless as the main salmon and sea trout spawning bed area it once

“insurmountable” price, putting the business in an “untenable situation”.He added: “With the costs of goods rising as it was, in good conscience could I really be asking the people of Prestonpans to be paying more for their products “I saw the writing on the wall – their own energy pricing will be going up and,anything, they will be needing to make their money go as far as possible, so we as a family decided we will leave before we are pushed.”Energy price rises for homes and businesses will continue after Ofgem announced that average energy bills will increase by £ from April – a rise of  per cent.Pandemic isolation rules put further pressure on staff and the Ashiq family.Ferhan added: “Running a store of that size is quite an undertaking: you end up working -hour days, seven days a week for three years, no holidays, no breaks.“Isolation measures put pressure on staff members covering other shts and working much harder.”Thanking the Prestonpans community, the shop owner said: “Our family is so thankful to everyone who helped us achieve what we have in Prestonpans for the last  years.“This business put myself and my sister through education and we both went to university off the back of it, and that could never have happenedthe community hadn’t shopped in our store.“I went to school with a lot of customers and I’m watching their kids grow up and become friends with my kids.”It has been confirmed that Day-Today has been sold and will “never be a convenience store again” – the new owner and business will not be revealed until March .The Ashiq family plans to stay in Prestonpans for the foreseeable future, while the family’s Levenhall Village Store in Musselburgh will remain open.Ferhan said: “I am looking to devote more time to my lovely we Hira, who has stood by me all these years throughout all the hardships, and my young children Harris, Niall and Daniel.”The alleged theft from the premises was reported to police, who are understood to be investigating the matter."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-leader-norman-hampshire-standing-re-election","story":"Norman Hampshire is Labour’s candidate for the Dunbar and East Linton ward in May’s East

Council to refuse planning permission for the flats, describing the new build as “over-dominant”.The proposal by Edinburgh-based BY Developments Ltd would see the bungalow on Gullane Main Street demolished and replaced by a passivhaus building containing four three-bedroom flats.In a letter to the local authority, the community council said that while it did not object to the idea of flats on the site, the current proposals were too big and it added that the design appeared to include windows which were just one metre from neighbouring houses, adding: “It is hard to imagine this providing adequate lighting.”The proposals to replace the house, known as Glen Maree, with the flats aims to make it as sustainable as possible, with its design statement describing the residential development as “net zero”.It will include electric car charging points at a private parking area to the rear of the property, solar  and non-fossil fuel heating systems.The roof design has been created to ensure maximum solar exposure to support the flats and the design statement points out that easy access to public transport is also available to new residents of the flats.It adds: “This development makes efficient use of land, buildings and infrastructure by altering a previously developed plot of land in a town centre rather than a greenfield site on the town periphery, for example.“Industry-leading Scottish cross laminated timber is to form the superstructure, whilst Passivhaus principals of airtightness, heat recovery and solar gain are to be employed to create very efficient, low-energy dwellings.“We believe this strategy will result in a very energy-efficient use of the plot, with the four new apartments using less energy than the existing building.“We intend to create an exemplar development that demonstrates sustainability without compromising design quality.”The design statement adds that the site itself is not in the Gullane Conservation Area but “on the periphery” of it.Despite plans to position the new building eight metres back from the Main Street pavement with a large front garden area, the community council said that the design did not fit the site.It said: “We have no issue with the general principle of creating flatted accommodation on the site.“The particular choice of design, creating four substantial flats across three floors rather than the two of the neighbouring houses, does appear to be over-dominant in scale.“Eventhe building were able to be set slightly further back this effect could be diminished, but the site appears not to lend itself to this.”The application is available to view on the council planning portal."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gift-card-scheme-saw-sales-rocket-first-pandemic-christmas","story":"The East Lothian

struggle to compete with online giants and out-of-town shopping centres.“We have been involved with the East Lothian Gt Card scheme from the outset, as it was created specically to encourage customers to think locally.“This is very important to us, as we also live in Tranent and know that money spent locally stays in the community.”No figures are available for the current financial year yet

It is estimating the policy could net the local authority £ million. The Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth has said that there will be no limit on the amount councils can charge. The report says wide-ranging proposals to redesign road space to encourage active transport are welcomed but warns: \"Without a signicant acceleration in planning processes, civic engagement and construction of new infrastructure now, the city’s target of becoming net-zero by  will not be achieved.\": SNP Government urged to act after Scotlands air pollution levels soared in Plans to introduce a mph speed limit on the majority of roads \"should be brought in rapidly\" to encourage safer walking and cycling.Bruce Whyte, Public Health Programme Manager for GCPH said Glasgow was leading in a number of initiatives but said Edinburgh had been ahead of the curve in terms of funding for active transport, which had resulted in a steady increase in pre-pandemic walking and cycling.\"Theres a lot of policy right now thats really good, its just about getting the momentum behind it,\" he said.\"I think they [Glasgow] are taking a lead but other cities are well ahead of them.

going to convince lots of people to cycle.\"People are still quite rightly concerned about the risks of cycling, particularlyyou are not a confident cyclist so reducing traffic would help with that.\"The mph speed limit seems to be taking an awful long time to bring in which would reduce traffic and help make people more comfortable about cycling and walking.\"He said a national plan to

less convenient and we get a better public transport system then people are still going to use their cars.\"He said that despite a sht to a hybrid of home and office working, levels of car use were only just below pre-pandemic levels, likely due to continuing Covid anxiety over the use of trains and buses. \"I think it will take a long time and there will have to be concerted campaigns to encourage people to use public transport,\" said Mr Whyte.The report also warns that Glasgow has an unequal environment for walking and cycling, describing this as a \"social injustice\".: Glasgow west end parking charges provoke angry backlash A failure to maintain the roads could scupper plans to encourage more people to commute using active travel.Without sufficient and dedicated funding for repairs, there is a danger that new cycle lanes will quickly degrade and use will decline. \"Typically, areas where the population has the potential to make the most signicant health gains due to  ealth contain the worst environmental conditions,\"the report said.\"Routine maintenance and repairs of active travel routes are not currently carried out timeously or are not undertaken at all. \"A clearly funded plan for regular repairsand maintenanceis needed.\"Around  deaths a year in Glasgow are attributed to pollution, with growing evidence linking poor air quality to diseases including dementia.However, Mr Whyte says people should not be dissuaded from walking, running and cycling.He said: \"As that evidence develops, I think we are going to become more and more concerned about air pollution but the overall benefits of walking and cycling outweigh some of the risks.\"A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: \"A spokesman said: “The active travel strategy is part of a wide ranging effort to create a sustainable transport system for Glasgow that supports the economy, tackles poverty, creates thriving neighbourhoods and is central to the fight against climate change.“Our active travel strategy aims to create a City Network of protected infrastructure throughout the city that will make walking, wheeling and cycling safer and more accessible for people in all

Self-deprecatory humour is one area where the audience enjoys the deliverer of such lines poking fun at their own person and behaviour.Les Dawson specialised in jokes about mothers-in law along with a iety of other harmless tropes which left his audience laughing innocently.Then there is the humour of cruelty where the comedian makes jokes which denigrate the objects of their humour and evoke laughter from such mockery, allowing the audience to enjoy their sense of superiority. Such humour has its followers and deserves to be identied as sick.Satire, which pokes fun at those who consider themselves of vital importance to the nation, is a vehicle intended to puncture the pomposity and the hypocrisies which betray the sense of self-importance of such personages. That type of humour is dangerous to the performers of this type of comedy where intolerance characterises the political regimes in power, but can thrive in liberal democracies.Today we have the comedians who are determined to push the boundaries to shock their audiences into laughing at the outrageous concepts contained therein and then feeling guilty for having done so. Jimmy Carr looks to that aspect of humour and concentrates his attention upon finding a way to make his audience laugh at remarks whichdelivered in print would shock and horry.His most recent joke about the victims of the Holocaustcomes into that category and he defends his schtick by saying it was no more than just a joke. To my mind he went beyond the boundaries so far that he entered the comedy of cruelty his target would then have allowed his audience to indulge their sense of superiority.The question which has to be asked is whether there is any subject which should be off-limits for comedians and remain taboo.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.HOUSING BOOM IN KILMARNOCKIT was disappointing to see the thoughtless conclusions drawn by your reporter from a Rightmove report that Kilmarnock has experienced the slowest rate of house-price growth in Scotland over the last  years . Even the headline to the article was misleading: there is a clear distinction between a house-price boom and a housing boom indeed a housing boom may explain why there is no house-price boom.Price tends to depend on the elementary principles of supply and demand and to conclude, solely on the basis there is no evidence of a signicant rise in house prices, that \"Killie is still not high up on the list of places Scots want to settle down in\" ignores the impact of increased supply. There has been extensive building of new developments in Kilmarnock over the last  years or so, with most of the nation’s leading house-builders involved.In March  Scottish Housing News reported that Taylor Wimpey alone was completing  years of continuous investment which had produced  new homes. When account is taken of the additional contributions from past and current developments by Persimmon, Barratt, Bellway, Miller Homes and others your readers might even reasonably conclude that Kilmarnock enjoys a prominent position in the list of places where peoplewish to settle down.Campbell Fullarton, Kilmarnock.* JUST to put the record right, Sir Alexander Fleming was born at Lochfield Farm, outside of Darvel in East Ayrshire, and not in Kilmarnock as your article suggests.

Its not a reckless gamble - but it is a gamble,\" said Professor Rowland Kao, chair of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University.\"Isolation is probably the single most important thing that we do to reduce onward transmission.\"Vaccination is definitely more important for reducing serious illness, but it may be that self-isolation is at least in the same order of magnitude, so its certainly a big step.\"Professor Rowland Kao Yet previous gambles - Englands Freedom Day at the peak of the Delta wave in July last year, and the refusal to impose measures beyond Plan B masks, vaccine passports, and home working as Omicron took off in December - did not result in the worst-case scenarios forecast by modellers.\"It might be okay because vaccine boosters have been so good, and the level of natural immunity now is so high because so many people have been infected with Omicron in a short time,\" said Prof Kao, who is also a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingwhich advises the Department of Health.\"These may be the most important things, andthats true itll be okay.\"Positive cases, by PCR and self-reported LFD, have plateaued at a high level since mid-January ICU admissions are on a par with July levelsFor now, the Scottish Government has no plans to dump quarantine, but the weeks ahead could see Scotland and England erge further than ever before on pandemic measures with the number of Covid testing centres operating in England also expected to be wound down from Spring alongside a rationing of free lateral flow tests to key workers, the immunosuppressed, and higher-risk settings such as hospitals, schools and care homes.: The challenge of ending self-isolation two years on from Covid The Scottish Government is due to unveil its Strategic Framework for the longer-term management of Covid on February , with the UK Governments own revised strategy following two days later on February .Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said it was \"far too soon\" to be lting legal requirements to self-isolate.She said: \"Any rise in infections - which are still three times higher than they were a few months ago - displaces other healthcare activities, and that has consequences for patients awaiting other treatments.\"You absolutely have to be open to emerging evidence, but hard and fast deadlines ahead of schedule - treating the virus like its a capital project where you come in under budget and ahead of time - its not like that.\"What will happen with waning vaccine protection, and waning immunity, which will inevitably occur as we go through the summer months \"What will happen will high levels of virus circulating in our country and abroad, and the potential for new and more worrisome iants  We are perpetually living with uncertainty.\"Jillian Evans, NHS Grampian Although the Prime Minister has stressed that a legal duty will be replaced by \"personal responsibility\" - meaning that people infected with Covid will be advised to stay home - many clinicians and public health experts fear that employers will be increasingly reluctant to tolerate staff taking sick leave for mild or even asymptomatic illness.There are also questions of how Covid cases will be detected and distinguished from other respiratory virusestesting capacity is scaled back.\"Healthcare has a lot of low paid staff who really would benefit from having the security of legally binding requirements to self-isolation during an infectious period rather than being the hero and coming into work when you could be spreading the virus,\" said Ms Evans, adding that she hoped the pandemic experience of mask-wearing and staying home while unwell would be adopted more widely in future to curb other infections, such as flu.One of the reasons why it is dficult to gauge the impact of lting compulsory self-isolation at this stage, however, is because it is impossible to be sure how rigorously it was ever enforced.In England, only  fines had been issued by December last year for breaches of self-isolation, and UK surveys have put self-reported compliance at anything from  per cent to %.: Scotland through the worst of Omicron wave There is also the harm-to-benefit analysis: in other words, do infections still do enough harm to justy requiring infected people quarantine at home for at least seven days - and up to  In Scotland, confirmed Covid cases have been hovering around - per day since mid-January but the number in intensive care -  - is back at July levels. At the same time, around % of NHS Scotlands workforce - , people - are off due to Covid.NHS Covid staff absences have halved from the January peak, but Covid-related absences still make up nearly half of all NHS absences from work Prof Kao cautioned it is unlikely healthcare settings could afford to \"take a more easygoing approach\" to isolation given the risk to patients, but stressed that other workplaces may provide ideal breeding grounds for transmission given that daily contacts still remain around half what they were last summer - and even further below pre-pandemic levels - with most of that dference coming from a reduction to in-work contacts.He added: \"That gives you an idea of the extent to which transmission risks could increase - by a factor of two. Thats enough to send things in the other direction.\"[Ending self-isolation] is clearly not a phased .

But those still trying to crack the -letter code, look away now. The Wordle for February  is ULCER. The game was created by software engineer, Josh Wardle, who recently announced he had sold the popular word game to the New York Times.On a statement on Twitter he wrote: “Since launching Wordle, I have been in awe of the response of everyone that has played.“The game has gotten bigger than I ever imagined .“It has been incredible to watch the game bring so much joy to so many and I feel so grateful for the personal stories some of you have shared with me – from Wordle uniting distant family members, to provoking friendly rivalries, to supporting medical recoveries.“On the flip side, I’d be lyingI said this hasn’t been overwhelming.“After all, I am just one person, and it is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone.“Given this, I am incredibly pleased to announce that I’ve reached an agreement with The New York Times for them to take over running Wordle going forward.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ipl-auction-2022-butterflies-already-started-safyaan-sharif-eyes-20-000-move","story":"The Scotland fast bowler will be one of  players from all around the world anxiously refreshing their social media feeds as the auction for the th edition of the Indian Premier Leagueunfolds over two tension-laden days.Shar is one of two Scots – Brad Wheal the other – who have made it this far and must now wait to see whether any of the  teams are willing to meet his asking price of around £, and add him to their squad for the latest instalment of the most lucrative and high-profile T tournament in the world.Unlike many of the drafts in North American sport, Shar insists there has been no prior contact or tapping-up ahead of the auction meaning he is as much in the dark as everyone  before the Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians and the rest start to select their chosen players.“I’ve been lucky just to reach to this point as it’s quite hard to get into the auction itself,” he says. “I’ve been following the IPL closely since it started and it’s always great to watch some of the best players in the world to see how they get on.“I just have to keep my fingers crossed now that I’ll get the chance to play in it myself this year. We don’t get any kinds of advance notice on how it might go. It’s just basically what happens over the weekend.“I’m sure my agent will get in touch with meit’s good news or I’ll see it myself on the IPL pages on Facebook and Twitter.

I felt it went well for me and I had a decent tournament and getting Kane Williamson out was a real special moment – it wasn’t the best of balls but it did the job!“As a team we maybe didn’t show as much as we should have once we got past the first round. We had plenty left in the tank but let ourselves down a bit. We didn’t score as many runs as we needed, although we came close in a couple of games to getting over the line.“Against the top sides in the world like India and Pakistan you have to be consistent in both halves of the game and we couldn’t do that. But it was all valuable experience and we’ll be in better shape when we go to Australia later in the year for the next one.”Scotland have a hectic year ahead on the field – plans are afoot to bring New Zealand to the Grange in the summer – but off the field there are signicant moves being made, too.Sportscotland has begun its independent review into racism in Scottish cricket and Huddersfield-born Shar hopes it will lead to more enlightened attitudes upon its conclusion.“Personally I’ve not suffered any direct racism in my career from junior level up to playing for Scotland,” he adds. “But I do know that there are areas that can be worked on and you hear stories from club cricket where Asians have had to deal with certain things and that’s not acceptable.“So this is an important review to get these things sorted and hopefully make Scottish cricket a level playing field for everyone.“I hope people will come to better understand dferent cultures and ethnicities and how things operate. Coming from a Muslim background, for example, there might be a few things that I don’t like or don’t want to do so hopefully by the end of the review there is a better understanding of what those dferences are.“I believe there’s a plan in place for the players to be approached to give their thoughts to the review and I’d be more than happy to do that."},{"url":null,"title":"winter-olympics-cross-country-skier-andrew-musgrave-disappointed-15km-showing-beijing","story":"The Scot was inside the top  through the first .km but struggled badly on the second circuit of the course and finished th in a time of  minutes . seconds.It left Musgrave searching for answers and for the first time, failing to find them.“To be honest, Im super disappointed and I cant really understand what went on,” said the -year-old.“In the build-up to the Olympics everything has gone to plan.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We have done so.“Instead of criticising the statutory regulator that exists to protect the rights of everyone in Britain, campaign groups should work with us to identy discrimination against LGBT people so we can take action together to stop it.”Earlier, a spokesperson for the EHRC told the BBC it takes all decisions impartially and “based on evidence in the UK and internationally”.The LGBT groups criticised the EHRC’s recent intervention on the Scottish Government’s bid to reform the Gender Recognition Act .The groups said: “Their recent statements on GRA reform in Scotland, and the conversion therapy ban in England and Wales, not only reverse their long-held positions but are in stark contrast to international human rights standards.“The EHRC’s stance seeks to strip trans people of legal protections and pose a grave threat to the ability of trans people to participate in daily le with dignity and respect.”A 🧵by our Director on why @EHRC is no longer acting as a credible, independent human rights institution and why weve submitted evidence to the @UN and @Ganhri to intervene in support of trans rights. Read and then take action. 👇🏻🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️👇🏻 https:t.co eDnBLeVpn— Stonewall ScotlandFebruary , The submission accuses the EHRC of lacking independence from the UK Government, which it says influences appointments on the body and has politicised its positions.Without the status, organisations cannot participate at the UN Human Rights Council.Last month, the EHRC was criticised by LGBT organisations after it said plans to change the law on gender recognition in Scotland required “further consideration”.Scottish Government ministers have tabled proposals to reform the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender, with a Bill expected at Holyrood this year.But the EHRC said “further consideration is needed before any change to the law should be made”.A spokesperson for the body said “everyone’s concerns should be discussed and addressed carefully, openly and with respect to avoid further damage and ision”, but insisted more time is needed.Our concerns have grown.We support this submission by @stonewalluk and the @GoodLawProject, expressing these concerns to the United Nations, which accredits national human rights institutions.https:t.co ldelTsUGi — Equality NetworkFebruary , Stonewall, a leading LGBT group which is a signatory on the submission to the UN, said the EHRC’s statement was an attack on trans equality and said it is “deeply troubled” by the approach the group is taking to trans people’s human rights.“The EHRC is calling for further delays to legislation that our communities have been waiting on for many years,” a Stonewall spokesperson said, insisting that the Scottish Government has given “ample opportunity for consultation”.Stonewall claimed the EHRC’s comments “undermine the EHRC’s core purpose of regulating, promoting and upholding human rights”.The Equality Network, a prominent LGBT charity in Scotland, echoed Stonewall’s comments, with director Tim Hopkins claiming the EHRC board is “directly appointed” by the UK Government and is “failing to stand up for equality for trans people”.Mr Hopkins added: “We do not need UK Government appointees telling us in Scotland how to legislate in devolved areas, and we look forward to the Scottish Government proceeding with this legislation soon.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The games are scheduled clearly ignoring that aspect,” Bielsa said on Friday.“The commercial aspects and the commitments due to the sales of the games make the decisions exclusively dependent on that. All of the aspects that make a competition fair for all those in it are not there in my opinion. Teams are facing each other in dferent conditions.“The games are planned without the possibility of rest and ignoring the potential injuries, but that’s the same for everybody.“There are aspects that increase the dficulty and complexity, and there are also aspects which can be resolved in a better way than the one chosen.“But the compromises that should be made for the spectacle of the game, and for the fairness of the competition, are a second thought.”Asked what he thought the solution might be, Bielsa said: “You guysknow better than us what the best solution is – to play less and to admit that to play less means less revenue.“The less revenue there is means we’re all going to have to earn less.Can you tell we’re happy to be back on the grass  😁 pic vRdDMDL— Kalvin PhillipsFebruary , “All these games are being played on top of each other – Cha are playing in one competition , the Africa Cup of Nations – taking away the nature of all the competitions, all the competitions are worse because of it.“And of course the English league suffers those consequences more than any because it’s the best organised and the one with the best players.”Leeds have suffered more than most with injuries this season and head to Merseyside still without Kalvin Phillips, Liam Cooper and Junior Firpo – all still recovering from hamstring injuries – and Patrick Bamford .England midfielder Phillips is expected toin the first few days of March, Bielsa said, while he anticipates defender Firpo might be back in action next week. vw,vw,px, px\"Frank Lampard is seeking to lt Everton clear of danger The match at Goodison Park brings Bielsa together again with Frank Lampard, just over three years on from a member of the Argentinian’s staff being caught trying to observe one of the English boss’ training sessions at Derby in what became known as the ‘Spygate’ row.Saturday’s game will be Lampard’s third in charge of his new club Everton, and askedthat made it dficult to have a clear picture of what to expect, Bielsa said: “I can’t give an opinion on the development of the team but the longer they spend with their new manager, the better the ideas will be implemented.”Leeds head into the contest having secured a battling draw at Villa Park last time out, having beaten West Ham - in their previous away outing before that.“Seasons like the one we are going through where there is constant adversity, it’s important to face it with a strong mental fortitude,” Bielsa said.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There is no rush.“Last night was a very good opportunity to start him because of Sadio not being here yet and Mocoming back from an incredibly tensetournament. And yes, he showed up.”Mane is set to go straight into the squad for Sunday’s trip to Burnley, having landed back in England on Wednesday night after extended celebrations in his homeland.He will be joined by captain Jordan Henderson, who was rested against Leicester because of a minor back problem.“Sadio will be available. He will come now this morning for training and will be in full training. We make a decision after that on how he feels,” said Klopp.“Emotionally he will still be high flying but physically we have to see how intense it was for him the last few days.“Hendo will definitely be back. That was the plan before thegame and is the plan now. If nothing happens he will play on Sunday.”For the first time since arriving at Anfield in , Klopp has a fully-fit squad which has more quality than he has ever had at his disposal.It meant the likes of centre-back Joe Gomez and striker Divock Origi did not even make the squad on Thursday.The manager now has to make dficult decisions on who to leave out for each match day, but he accepts it is a good problem to have as they are still in contention for four trophies this season.Jürgen Klopp has confirmed Sadio Mane could come into contention for #BURLIV on Sunday.— Liverpool FCFebruary , “It didn’t happen a lot that we have this kind of quality players and they couldn’t make the squad,” Klopp said.“Joe’s situation was we had to make a decision whether we wanted a second centre-half on the bench or not, while Divock was not too long back in training after his injury so that was the decision there.“It’s good to have options with the quality they have. Takiis in a good moment, whenever Div trains it is like ‘Why is he not playing ’, Oxplayed up front a really good part so now we have options – but that’s what we need.“We have a chat group where we share all information around the team and in this group the players who were not available or whatever always send a message saying ‘Good luck boys’ or whatever. And we had times when we had  or  players texting, which means they were not available for us. vw,vw,px, px\"Klopp has dficult selection decisions to make now he has a fully-fit squad available “Now we have a dferent situation. But I’ve said it before, it’s more important how we play than who is playing.“The situation is not easy to be a star in the team but it is not allowed to cost you confidence, thinking ‘I might play today but not tomorrow’.“We have to make sure that as a group we use that situation in the best possible way.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They need confidence, they need support, and to have done this in this way, I think Sadiq Khan is completely wrong.“It will leave a void at the top as opposed to a properly managed handover, which is no way to run a service like this.”Her accusations were rejected by sources close to the mayor, who said Dame Cressida had agreed to carry on serving for a “short period” to allow an orderly transition.It is understood Dame Cressida was called to a meeting with the mayor at .pm on Thursday over the reforms, but declined to attend and offered her resignation instead, catching the Home Office by surprise.Home Secretary Priti Patel was said to have been angered by Mr Khan’s failure to inform her of his intention to request a meeting with the commissioner, which she considered “rude and unprofessional”.We must urgently rebuild Londoners’ trust in the Met and root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exist.To do that, change must start from the very top. My message to Londoners: pic BLRshimE— Sadiq KhanFebruary , Ms Patel will oversee the appointment of the new commissioner and more details on how she will set about searching for a replacement are expected to be confirmed in due course.She has the final decision on the next appointment, although the process requires her to consult Mr Khan as mayor, who said he would be “working closely” with the Home Secretary to find a successor.The search for a replacement by Ms Patel comes as the Met is investigating Government officials over lockdown-busting Downing Street parties, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson.He is expected to be among more than  iniduals in No  and Whitehall who will by the end of this week start receiving legal questionnaires from officers working on Operation Hillman.The Met, which was heavily criticised for an apparent hesitation to launch a probe into the alleged parties, said the investigation continues as normal and remains under the control of Commander Catherine Roper. vw,vw,px, px\"The PA news agency understands Home Secretary Priti Patel was unaware of the mayor’s request to meet Dame Cressida Dame Cressida has faced a series of scandals during her time leading Britain’s biggest police force – most recently concerning violently racist, misogynist and homophobic messages exchanged by officers based at Charing Cross police station that were published by a watchdog.And there was fury over the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer, as well as the force’s actions following her death in tackling a vigil held in her memory during coronavirus restrictions. There was also clumsy advice telling women in trouble to flag down a passing bus that later had to be retracted.Rank and file officers reacted with sadness to Dame Cressida’s departure, with the chairman of the politan Police Federation Ken Marsh protesting she had been treated unfairly.Mr Marsh told PA: “She was much loved across the rank and file of the politan Police Service.“We feel the way she has been treated is wholly unfair and we did believe that she was the person who could take us through this and bring us out the other side.”pic KwQTMvo— Priti PatelFebruary , But former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, whose house was raided by officers from the Met’s failed Operation Midland launched in reaction to  allegations by jailed fantasist Carl Beech about a murderous VIP paedophile ring, said he was delighted by the news.“It is now time to clean the Augean stables so that a full inquiry can be conducted on all her personal mistakes,” he said.Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women’s Justicecharity, said: “There were far too many stories of officers accused of violence and abuse still in their jobs, and of whistleblowers victimised instead of listened to.“Cressida Dick’s response to these series of stories has been wholly inadequate and her description of Wayne Couzens as a ‘wrong un’ meaningless next to the mounting evidence of multiple allegations of abuse and policing failures to tackle violence against women and racism.”Commissioner Cressida Dick will resign from the politan Police Service – read her statement here.https:t.co HldsLRI pic sACqkVZmy— politan PoliceFebruary , Dame Cressida announced she was stepping down from the job on Thursday just hours after insisting she had no intention of going during an interview with the BBC.In her statement, she said: “It is with huge sadness that following contact with the Mayor of London today, it is clear that the mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue.“He has left me no choice but to step aside as Commissioner of the politan Police Service.”Mr Khan earlier this week indicated that Dame Cressida’s future hung in the balance over her response to problems with the culture within the Met, and how to restore the public’s confidence in the force by rooting out “racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny”.My statement on the departure of the Met Commissioner: pic cxvxbTxTaW— Mayor of London, Sadiq KhanFebruary , On Thursday, he said: “It’s clear that the only way to start to deliver the scale of the change required is to have new leadership right at the top of the politan Police.”Ms Patel, who reportedly had past clashes with Dame Cressida, praised the officer’s “steadfast dedication”.The Home Secretary added: “She would be the first to say that she has held the role during challenging times yet for nearly five years she has undertaken her duties with a steadfast dedication to protecting our capital city and its people, including during the unprecedented period of the pandemic.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

However, the Prime Minister — currently on a charm offensive as part of a mission to restore his reputation — has said he expects the last domestic rules in England could end earlythe data permits. Boris Johnson made the announcement on Wednesday, as Robin Swann was still waiting for an expert assessment on whether he can press ahead with lting restrictions in Northern Ireland.Read MoreRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NIEarlier this week, the Health Minister told a press briefing that he wants to lt most, “ not all” remaining measures. Key to all of this, however, is the legal and public health advice he receives. It is understood that even as late as Wednesday night he hadn’t been given the green light to press ahead with relaxations and it isn’t entirely clear what this will entaillawyers tell him he has the power to act without Executive approval. If this proves to be the case, Mr Swann then has to decide which restrictions he will lt.Among the rules that remain are the controversial Covid certicate scheme for nightclubs, a minimum self-isolation period for people who test positive, a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces, and the regular use of lateral flow tests. Given Mr Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, there was hope that Mr Swann would follow suit, but a spokeswoman from the Department of Health on Wednesday night poured cold water on any such suggestion. “There are no immediate plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland,” she said. “All aspects of test and trace are kept under active review.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, while this may be Mr Swann’s preferred position, his hands may be forced on the matterMr Johnson scraps lateral flow testsin England. To date, NI’s supply has come from England and it will be dficult for the UUP minister to make a case to the public that they should pay for LFTs as it is unlikely Westminster will pay outthey aren’t in use across the water. The only other alternative would be for Stormont to pick up the cost — and given the current political instability, it’s anyone’s guess whether that would even be possible.As it stands, Covid- is still re in Northern Ireland.Given current testing arrangements, the actual number of positive cases is likely to be signicantly higher than those on the Department of Health’s dashboard. Realistically, how many people are actually recording positive LFT results Mercully, Omicron has not turned out to be as dangerous as first feared — at least to most people. But there are still tens of thousands of people here who are clinically extremely vulnerable and for whom the vaccinations may not provide effective protection.Many have had to shield and make extraordinary sacrices to stay safe over the past two years. While the wider population is looking forward to a e to normal, it is these very changes and relaxations that will force the clinically vulnerable to retreat even more from the world.Related topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannBoris JohnsonMore On Department of HealthNI health trusts short of almost  permanent consultants, according to BMA vacancy reportMore than , calls to Leline helpline in Northern Ireland last year, new figures reveal PremiumRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NICoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow There’s still a lot of work to be done to deal with mental health issues of young people in NI, says Koulla YiasoumaMost ReadFamous London restaurant The Ivy to open eaterie in Belfast city centreKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyMystery over £bn school fund that ‘no one checked on for years’ aimed at helping NI pupils from socially deprived backgroundsNightride: Thriller filmed in Belfast snapped up by NetflixSir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister to address anti-protocol rally in DromoreTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayWhat does the future of museums look like  PlayAssisi animal sanctuary ‘blown away’ by support after online dog fostering call following noise complaintLatest Northern IrelandNew Novavax Covid vaccine approved for use in UK following trial in Northern IrelandAnother  Covid-linked deaths recorded in weekly updateReward of £, offered for information about murder of Belfast manStephen Fallon hailed as ‘brilliant’ by legendary Linfield midfielder Michael GaultWhy Glentoran have the edge over Linfield in title race, explains Stephen McAlorumLatestBoy, , killed in road crashNorthern Ireland women’s squad: Megan Bell and Abbie Magee back after injury recoveries as boss Kenny Shiels issues challengeGregor Townsend’s side aim for another win – Wales v Scotland talking pointsLabour MP has whip suspended over alleged racist comments to journalistNorwich need more than slice of good fortune to conquer Man City – Dean Smith,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No charges have ever been brought.“We know that out of  suspects from the planning of the bomb to its execution, six weren’t even questioned by police. There are many issues we’d like addressed and I believe they merit a public inquiry.“At the very least, I think we deserve a fresh inquest as the original one, in our view, did not resolve some matters for us. The  HETreport left us with more questions than answers.”Ms Forrest’s brother David Harkness, a -year-old joiner, was killed with seven others.The eight men had left work at Lisanelly Army base in Omagh and were travelling in a Ford Transit van towards Cookstown when a roadside bomb exploded at Teebane crossroads on January , .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The company employing them, Karl Construction, was targeted because it carried out work for the security forces.Three weeks later, the UDA shot dead five men in Sean Graham’s bookies in the Lower Ormeau area of Belfast, alleging it was in retaliation for Teebane. The five Belfast murders were examined in a -page Police Ombudsman’s report published on Tuesday.Ms Forrest said: “I will never forget the Sean Graham’s shooting. It made me sick to the pit of my stomach that anyone would claim it had anything to do with us.“It wasn’t done in our name. We were in deep trauma at the time. We did not want anyone  to be put in that place. It’s something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.“Neither our family, nor any of the Teebane families, wanted retaliation. I would love the opportunity to meet the Lower Ormeau families and tell them that personally.”Ms Forrest said she welcomed victims of any atrocity making progress in their campaign for justice and hoped that the Teebane families could also make advances.“Sometimes I feel like Teebane is the forgotten atrocity,” she said. “I can’t understand why. It was one of the biggest single losses of le in the Troubles.“Given that there have been no convictions, I am perplexed as to why there isn’t more clamour about it.“I feel we need to remind everybody that eight men were murdered — that they were eliminated because of the legitimate jobs they did.“It can be very hurtful when Teebane passes under the radar. It feels to us that our loved ones lives were less valuable than others’, that there is a hierarchy of victims in Northern Ireland.”Ms Forrest said that unionist politicians were not active enough in pursuing justice issues.“I look across the political ide, and I see Sinn Fein championing the Bloody Sunday, Ballymurphy and a whole range of other cases,” she said.“I think unionist politicians have let us down. They’re not out there calling for action on Teebane. Nobody seems to be fighting for us. I’m very disappointed that pressure isn’t being brought to bear in terms of our justice campaign.“Nobody seems to be doing the right thing by our family and the other Teebane families.”Ms Forrest said her brother had been working in Australia for two years, but he ed to Northern Ireland because their mother was seriously ill.“There was no Skype or Zoom in those days. We didn’t think mammy would make it. David wanted to see her so he came back.“Mammy lived and he didn’t. She always said, ‘God brought David home to die’.“After mammy recovered, he started saving up money to go back to Australia. It was hard to get work as a joiner. He took a job with Karl Construction. He kept that very much to himself but we knew he was working on the Army base in Omagh.”Seven men, including David, died outright. They were Gary Bleeks , Cecil Caldwell , Robert Dunseath , Richard McConnelland Nigel McKee . The van’s driver Oswald Gilchristdied in hospital four days later.Ms Forrest said her brother was the youngest of six in their family, and the only son.“We always used to joke that it would be a brave woman who came to take him away from all his sisters.“Little did we no there would never be the chance of that happening,” Ms Forrest said.“David was a lovely, decent hard-working country lad. He didn’t have a political bone in his body. We were brought up in a Christian home to love our neighbours and respect everybody. We never thought we had any enemies.“He was a joiner doing a day’s work —that shouldn’t have put a target on his back.”Most ReadFamous London restaurant The Ivy to open eaterie in Belfast city centreKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyMystery over £bn school fund that ‘no one checked on for years’ aimed at helping NI pupils from socially deprived backgroundsSir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister to address anti-protocol rally in DromoreNightride: Thriller filmed in Belfast snapped up by NetflixTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayWhat does the future of museums look like  PlayAssisi animal sanctuary ‘blown away’ by support after online dog fostering call following noise complaintLatest Northern IrelandNew Novavax Covid vaccine approved for use in UK following trial in Northern IrelandAnother  Covid-linked deaths recorded in weekly updateReward of £, offered for information about murder of Belfast manStephen Fallon hailed as ‘brilliant’ by legendary Linfield midfielder Michael GaultWhy Glentoran have the edge over Linfield in title race, explains Stephen McAlorumLatestBrandon Lewis: Unionists shouldto powersharing after Stormont electionsMarcelo Bielsa believes commercial aspects in football override player welfareEddie Howe backs Newcastle star Allan Saint-Maximin to earn France call-upAdele shocks fans with surprise appearance at London nightclubRights watchdog boss says critics have ‘wrong target’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However she did not attend and submitted her resignation instead.Among those being touted for her job is PSNI chief Simon Byrne, who has experience in London as a former Met assistant commissioner. The Surrey native was the Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police from  to  and the Assistant Commissioner for Territorial Policing in the politan Police Service from  to . He then served as Chief Constable of Cheshire Constabulary from  to .There are previous links between PSNI chief constables and the Met. Sir Hugh Orde was a Met deputy assistant commissioner, while his successor Matt Baggott started his career with the politan Police in .The Home Office did not know about Ms Dick’s resignation in advance, with a mayoral source confirming: It was a Sadiq-led thing.The force has faced recently criticism over its apparent hesitation to launch an investigation into alleged parties held in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office during lockdown.And there was fury over the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer, as well as the force#s actions following her death in tackling a vigil held in her memory during coronavirus restrictions, and issuing clumsy advice telling women in trouble to flag down a passing bus that later had to be retracted.On Thursday evening, in a shock statement, Dame Cressida announced she was stepping down from the job, despite hours earlier having insisted she had no intention of going.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDame Cressida announced last night sheGetty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDame Cressida announced last night sheShe said: It is with huge sadness that following contact with the Mayor of London today, it is clear that the Mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue.He has left me no choice but to step aside as Commissioner of the politan Police Service. Hours earlier, when asked by the BBCshe should step down she said: I have absolutely no intention of going and I believe that I am and have been, actually for the last five years, leading a real transformation in the Met.Mr Khan earlier this week indicated that Dame Cressida#s future hung in the balance over her response to problems with the culture within the Met, and how to restore the public#s confidence in the force.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart.

I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it. He added: ldquoIrsquom pleased with the second half performance but certainly not with the first.Looking forward to his sidersquos next match, where they face a tough battle away to Meath, the Down boss said: ldquoWersquoll try to get more men back on the field and we will train hard over the next week to try and improve.ldquoYou canrsquot just sit off for  minutes and expect to still be in games.Down: G McMahon, P Fegan, F McElroy, B McArdle R McCormack, N McParland, D OrsquoHagan A Doherty, O Murdock C Mooney, L Kerr, C McCartanB OrsquoHagan , K McKernan, A Gilmore .Subs: C Poland for D OrsquoHagan, P Havern for K McKernan, J McCartan for C Mooney, C Francis for R McCormick, T Close for N McParland.Yellow Card: J McCartanGalway: C Flaherty K Molloy, S Kelly , S McGrath D McHugh, J Daly, C McDaid P Kelly, M Tierney O Gallagher , R Finnerty , F OrsquoLaoi S Walsh , P Conroy , T Culhane .Subs: D Comerfor R Finnerty, P Kelly for F OrsquoLaoi, T Gill for C McDaid, C Sweeney for T Culhane, D Conneely for P Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Poots.jpg","title":"Ministerial approval for  ambitious park proposal  ","story":"EXCITEMENT is building around the multi-million pound revamp of the stunningly picturesque Castlewellan Forest Park.Work is already underway on an ambitious scheme which will focus on a number of key areas as part of the major investment programme aimed at restoring the sprawling forest parkrsquos key heritage features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Lottery Fund has provided almost pound.m in assistance with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand the EU weighing in with pound,.Construction work is well underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park with other planned work including new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park an a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue and caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.Funding from the government department and Newry, Mourne and Down Council is financing the restoration of the iconic th century greenhouse, reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13460777.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Surely this would set a precedent for other devolved regions to unilaterally interpret or undermine any other international trade deal or agreement that the UK government has with other countries.Scotland and Wales could also choose to opt in or out of commitments made by the UK government. I don t think that that would go down too well.Trade arrangements and international agreements are devolved to Westminster and while they may not be liked in Northern Ireland, they are UK domestic law.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Winsberg, , who has  years of clinical practice and spent three years as the onsite psychiatrist at the Facebook Wellness Center, found herself single when her -year marriage ended in orce. She started to explore Bumble, Tinder and Hinge, and says: “In using dating apps, I began to joke that I could make a psychiatric diagnosis in less than  texts.”Sting through texts to find golden nuggets of information, her experience in psychiatry helped her see the people she engaged with on dating apps clearly – often after exchanging just a few messages.“I’ve met a lot of interesting people through dating apps, and have made some dear friends as well as quite a few romantic partners. I’ve had quite an adventure. But one needs to check one’s expectations, which are inversely proportional to the happiness that we derive from these tools,” she advises. “Take a fun and relaxed approach to it, and don’t think you’re going to meet the love of your le.”The book attempts to identy specic personalities through the language of texts, empowering people to read between the lines to find outyour potential partner is suitable dating material.In the book, she explores the ‘big five’ personality types, using the acronym OCEAN – Openness to experience Conscientiousness Extroversion Agreeableness Neuroticism. These can tell you a lot about how compatible you may be with your date, she says – and it can be identied through their language.“Take time to understand what personality type might be right for you.” An extrovert, for example, might give you a better social le, but pay you less attention at a party, because they are going to be off talking to other people.”How to spot a liar“There are telltale signs of lying over text, such as dropping the first person pronoun,” Winsberg says. “When we tell a lie, we tend to distance ourselves from the statement. Instead of saying ‘I’m running late’, you might text: ‘Running late’.“You may also speak in a repetitive way. Liars tend to say the same thing over and over again, hoping that makes it seem more true. It might be repeating the same thing three times about how the car broke down.”Red flags“In terms of text clues, we can start to see red flags when there’s an imbalance in the way people are texting each other. Is there a level playing field  What’s the pace at which people are replying to each other  Is somebody leaving you hanging for a really long time before responding, which doesn’t fit with the way you’ve been texting them “It says there’s a mismatch in either expectation or the power gradient. Who is holding the reins in the text message ”Too much information“A notion of intimacy, too much information too soon, or trying to develop too close a relationship before the relationship has had a chance to progress, can be a red flag of insecure attachment, and a neediness in their approach.”Rushing into a relationship without a strong foundation rarely lends itself to stability, and instant infatuation is likely to disappoint, she observes.Too little emotionA text exchange with no emotion could be a red flag, she notes. If the texts are flat, with no smiling in the language and little energy, this might be an indication the date is emotionally aloof.Control issuesSome people manage the anxiety of attachment by trying to control their environment, Winsberg points out. This could be an early text displaying the desire to control or a lack of flexibility – such as presuming you’ll want to meet them without asking first.Language chemistry“How well does your own language match with theirs  Is there chemistry in the language ” asks Winsberg – saying how well your humour styles match might be an indication of compatibility.Exclamation marks and ellipsesExclamation marks have an “anxious, excitable, ‘pay attention to me’ quality”, says Winsberg.“Exclamations tend to be more of a neurotic feature. People who use the ellipsisfrequently are likely to be more flirty and have more innuendo in their language. There may be less certainty involved in a relationship with a person who is using a lot of ellipses.”It’s only words“An extrovert will use the word ‘mouth’ more often, along with ‘drinks’, ‘other’, ‘restaurant’ and ‘dancing’. Those high in neuroticism, in contrast, are drawn to using the words ‘awful’, ‘though’, ‘lazy’, and ‘depressing’,” she says.“Extroverts are more likely to use the thumbs up emoji and the winking face emoji, and are less likely to use the exaggerated emojis – like the tired face or the eye-rolling face.“The masters of long-term relationships, those high in the agreeable dimension, will use the words ‘wonderful’, ‘together’, ‘morning’, and ‘spring’ with greater frequency,” she explains in the book. “Those extremely conscientious types will pepper their language with ‘completed’, ‘stupid’, ‘boring’ and ‘adventure’.“A person high in conscientiousness is likely to follow through on what they say they will do, or be a little bit more responsible. They may be a more stable relationship partner,” she continues.Colons correlate with conscientiousness, perhaps because they can be found in organised lists. “People who use expressions like ‘could’ve’, ‘should’ve’ are lower on the conscientiousness scale, so when you see a discrepancy between intent and outcome in language, that will betray a lower conscientiousness.”What he wants, what she wants“In general, men prefer shorter messages. One study showed in the course of a relationship,there’s a lot of texting happening, women tend to think, ‘Oh good, we’re getting along well’,” says Winsberg – whereas “research found men tend to find longer messages a bit scary initially, and see less communication as a sign of health in a relationship”.Deal-breakers“Everyone has their deal-breakers. It may be one person really doesn’t want to be with anyone who has addiction issues. Another is infidelity. There isn’t a unorm red flag for everybody.“Without directly asking someonethey’re an alcoholic orthey’re going to cheat on you, how do you bring up issues that may be sensitive for you ”Winsberg’s advice is to: “Introduce the subject and elicit their formed opinions about it”, asking “open-ended questions and seeing what emerges”.Green flags“Green flag indications include a similar style of humour, language style matching, the cadence between theand frequency of the text messages, and the timing of them.”*Speaking In Thumbs by Mimi Winsberg is published by Bluebird Books, priced £..

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLes Pughs’ own Explorer Scout unit recently had an evening visit from Nick Reece, who is a marine artist based in Sully.Marine art is a form of figurative art which portrays or draws its main inspiration from the sea.Mr Pugh shared some insight into how he swapped a career in banking to pursue his passion for art.Then, with the aid of several paintings, he explained the thought process and technical methods used to create his seascape pictures.He emphasized to the scout unit that by painting subjects which you have a keen interest in – such as the sea – it makes the task enjoyable, adding how it’s also important commercially to paint scens which other people can relate to.Scout leader, Lucien Boudier, said: “Unusually for the group many had questions for Nick during the talk, also giving their opinions when askedthey liked the art.“Talking is all well and good but doing is far more fun, so it was soon onto the creative section of the evening.”Taking on board information given by Mr Pugh during his talk, he guided them through painting a sunset beach scene – demonstrating the technique of building the picture, which the scouts used within their own work.“As the paint got mixed and applied to their own creations, first lesson, for Joe and Hugh was ‘less is more’ – while Beth ditched the brush for her fingers,” added Mr Boudier.“Starting with the sky then adding the sun - unless you did a moon scene - the pictures built up with sand and sea following.“Putting some definition into the foreground, with some rocks, crabs and other assorted beach debris brought some definition to the pictures.”By the end of the two-hour talk and painting session all who attended had created their own version of a ‘sunset beach’ following tips and tricks shared by Mr Pugh.Want to get your children involved with Scouts  To find the Scout units based near you visit www.scouts.org.uk groups  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityTwenty LGBT organisations, including Stonewall, claim the commissionis working to remove legal protections for trans people.A -page submission to the UN – which the groups say was prompted by the EHRC’s stance on trans rights – asks for the independent status of the body to be reviewed.But EHRC chief executive Marcial Boo said on Friday: “Stonewall and other critics are aiming at the wrong target.“The EHRC has the power to prosecute people and companies that discriminate against trans people. We have done so.“Instead of criticising the statutory regulator that exists to protect the rights of everyone in Britain, campaign groups should work with us to identy discrimination against LGBT people so we can take action together to stop it.”Earlier, a spokesperson for the EHRC told the BBC it takes all decisions impartially and “based on evidence in the UK and internationally”.The LGBT groups criticised the EHRC’s recent intervention on the Scottish Government’s bid to reform the Gender Recognition Act .The groups said: “Their recent statements on GRA reform in Scotland, and the conversion therapy ban in England and Wales, not only reverse their long-held positions but are in stark contrast to international human rights standards.“The EHRC’s stance seeks to strip trans people of legal protections and pose a grave threat to the ability of trans people to participate in daily le with dignity and respect.”A 🧵by our Director on why @EHRC is no longer acting as a credible, independent human rights institution and why weve submitted evidence to the @UN and @Ganhri to intervene in support of trans rights. Read and then take action. 👇🏻🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️👇🏻 https:t.co eDnBLeVpn— Stonewall ScotlandFebruary , The submission accuses the EHRC of lacking independence from the UK Government, which it says influences appointments on the body and has politicised its positions.Without the status, organisations cannot participate at the UN Human Rights Council.Last month, the EHRC was criticised by LGBT organisations after it said plans to change the law on gender recognition in Scotland required “further consideration”.Scottish Government ministers have tabled proposals to reform the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender, with a Bill expected at Holyrood this year.But the EHRC said “further consideration is needed before any change to the law should be made”.A spokesperson for the body said “everyone’s concerns should be discussed and addressed carefully, openly and with respect to avoid further damage and ision”, but insisted more time is needed.Our concerns have grown.We support this submission by @stonewalluk and the @GoodLawProject, expressing these concerns to the United Nations, which accredits national human rights institutions.https:t.co ldelTsUGi — Equality NetworkFebruary , Stonewall, a leading LGBT group which is a signatory on the submission to the UN, said the EHRC’s statement was an attack on trans equality and said it is “deeply troubled” by the approach the group is taking to trans people’s human rights.“The EHRC is calling for further delays to legislation that our communities have been waiting on for many years,” a Stonewall spokesperson said, insisting that the Scottish Government has given “ample opportunity for consultation”.Stonewall claimed the EHRC’s comments “undermine the EHRC’s core purpose of regulating, promoting and upholding human rights”.The Equality Network, a prominent LGBT charity in Scotland, echoed Stonewall’s comments, with director Tim Hopkins claiming the EHRC board is “directly appointed” by the UK Government and is “failing to stand up for equality for trans people”.Mr Hopkins added: “We do not need UK Government appointees telling us in Scotland how to legislate in devolved areas, and we look forward to the Scottish Government proceeding with this legislation soon.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Rights watchdog boss says critics have  uwrong target u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They need confidence, they need support, and to have done this in this way, I think Sadiq Khan is completely wrong.“It will leave a void at the top as opposed to a properly managed handover, which is no way to run a service like this.”Her accusations were rejected by sources close to the mayor, who said Dame Cressida had agreed to carry on serving for a “short period” to allow an orderly transition.It is understood Dame Cressida was called to a meeting with the mayor at .pm on Thursday over the reforms, but declined to attend and offered her resignation instead, catching the Home Office by surprise.Home Secretary Priti Patel was said to have been angered by Mr Khan’s failure to inform her of his intention to request a meeting with the commissioner, which she considered “rude and unprofessional”.We must urgently rebuild Londoners’ trust in the Met and root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exist.To do that, change must start from the very top.

There was also clumsy advice telling women in trouble to flag down a passing bus that later had to be retracted.Rank and file officers reacted with sadness to Dame Cressida’s departure, with the chairman of the politan Police Federation Ken Marsh protesting she had been treated unfairly.Mr Marsh told PA: “She was much loved across the rank and file of the politan Police Service.“We feel the way she has been treated is wholly unfair and we did believe that she was the person who could take us through this and bring us out the other side.”pic KwQTMvo— Priti PatelFebruary , But former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, whose house was raided by officers from the Met’s failed Operation Midland launched in reaction to  allegations by jailed fantasist Carl Beech about a murderous VIP paedophile ring, said he was delighted by the news.“It is now time to clean the Augean stables so that a full inquiry can be conducted on all her personal mistakes,” he said.Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women’s Justicecharity, said: “There were far too many stories of officers accused of violence and abuse still in their jobs, and of whistleblowers victimised instead of listened to.“Cressida Dick’s response to these series of stories has been wholly inadequate and her description of Wayne Couzens as a ‘wrong un’ meaningless next to the mounting evidence of multiple allegations of abuse and policing failures to tackle violence against women and racism.”Commissioner Cressida Dick will resign from the politan Police Service – read her statement here.https:t.co HldsLRI pic sACqkVZmy— politan PoliceFebruary , Dame Cressida announced she was stepping down from the job on Thursday just hours after insisting she had no intention of going during an interview with the BBC.In her statement, she said: “It is with huge sadness that following contact with the Mayor of London today, it is clear that the mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue.“He has left me no choice but to step aside as Commissioner of the politan Police Service.”Mr Khan earlier this week indicated that Dame Cressida’s future hung in the balance over her response to problems with the culture within the Met, and how to restore the public’s confidence in the force by rooting out “racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny”.My statement on the departure of the Met Commissioner: pic cxvxbTxTaW— Mayor of London, Sadiq KhanFebruary , On Thursday, he said: “It’s clear that the only way to start to deliver the scale of the change required is to have new leadership right at the top of the politan Police.”Ms Patel, who reportedly had past clashes with Dame Cressida, praised the officer’s “steadfast dedication”.The Home Secretary added: “She would be the first to say that she has held the role during challenging times yet for nearly five years she has undertaken her duties with a steadfast dedication to protecting our capital city and its people, including during the unprecedented period of the pandemic.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Mayor faces backlash over ousting of Scotland Yard chief Cressida Dick article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I have not spoken to any local resident in support of this proposal,” he said.He claimed that the application “clearly intends to be a new tourist facility. Glamping pods are a feature specic to tourism.”He suggested that the pods are “designed for overnight use”.“It is concerning that the recommendation for approval is based on being a community facility. This is not backed up by any evidence.“I suspect this is a Trojan horse to allow overnight space. Glamping pods are intrinsically a tourist facility,” he commented.“If it is a care facility, it should be conditioned as such.”Larne Lough DUP Alderman Paul Reid askedthis could be enforced by the council.Mr Duffy said that the application describes it as a respite care facility for the disabled.“It is not described as a tourist facility. Therefore the description does not allow for tourist use and condition reinforces that. If the council receives complaints that it is not used as originally intended, we would investigate that. If the applicant could not provide evidence, we could take a course of action.”Larne Lough Alliance Councillor Robert Logan askedit is part of a farm ersication scheme.He was informed by the officer that it is a “stand alone project”.Ald Reid proposed that the committee would not accept the recommendation.He said that he had concerns that the local primary school had withdrawn its consent.His proposal was seconded by Cllr Logan who reiterated that the primary school has withdrawn its support.Ald Reid added: “It is not part of any farm ersity.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy ReporterRead

INBT-ACThe court in  heard the defendant had “painted ‘KKK’ on a foreign national’s property”.The prosecutor added: “It was a vacant property. A foreign national was due to move into that property the following day. The matter is being prosecuted as being aggravated by hostility.”A defence barrister told the  court the defendant believed he was being “brain-washed by the amount of social media that he was consuming at the time and he was accepting at face value a lot of anti-immigration and similar types of posts.“That then led him to carry out the offence because he feared the house next door was going to become a multi-occupancy address and that there may be foreign nationals moving into the area.“That fear was baseless in that there was no suggestion that anything had happened to him that would give him reasonable cause for concern.“It simply was a consumption of negative social media views which then manested itself in a stupid decision by Mr Boyd to paint this on an empty house next door.“It is not a very sensible thing for Mr Boyd to have done. Thankfully, there was no one in the address that had to move out as a result of his actions but certainly there may have been a delay to the use of the property by the Housing Executive.”In , District Judge Nigel Broderick told Boyd: “This is a very serious incident, I have seen the photographs and you have painted this house with very gratuitous remarks and I’m satisfied that the offence is aggravated by virtue of hostility”.Ballymena Court has now heard the defendant was alleged to have breached the Community Service Order by failing to complete the  hours of unpaid work he had been ordered to do.A defence solicitor recently said he understood  hours were still be completed.The case had then been adjourned to February  when the defence lawyer said a further  hours had been completed since the last court date.The solicitor said a Probation Officer was seeking a further adjournment for the Community Service to be completed.The defence solicitor said the defendant has ten children and the background to the Community Service not being completed on time was “a series of illnesses with the children”.The solicitor said Boyd “tells me he actually very much enjoys going to the Community Service”.Judge Broderick adjourned the case to February .Read More Read MoreRead more:Ballymena  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from

It is a very busy play park used by the Scarva residents and this investment is most welcome.”Councillor Sam Nicholson seconded the proposal and said it was great to see lots of dferent areas across the borough ‘getting improved play parks’ and the committee voiced its approval for the proposal.Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart MP described the move as ‘a signicant step forward in making the plan a reality for local children’.The DUP MP said: “This is fantastic news for the children of Scarva, who will love their new play park when it becomes a reality.“Getting to this point has taken some time and a lot of work. I want to thank my colleagues on the Council, Cllr. Paul Greenfield and Cllr. Ian Wilson, for their endeavours in this regard,” said the MP.Read More Read MoreProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , vehicles dailyCraigavon Borough CouncilArmagh CityBanbridge  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsPortadown mum making own wine, knitting her wedding dress an...NewsWoman cautioned after boy injured in Lurgan crash...NewsDiversions after three vehicle crash in Portadown...News arrested following UDA criminality-linked probe search in Carrickfergus\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-following-uda-criminality-linked-probe-search-in-carrickfergus- itm_sourceparsely-api\" arrested following UDA criminality-linked probe search in Carrickfergus\" \"\" width\"\" arrested following UDA criminality-linked probe search in Carrickfergus\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-following-uda-criminality-linked-probe-search-in-carrickfergus- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Manarrested following UDA criminality-linked probe sea...NewsMost PopularBest pizza ovens  UK: the best pizza oven for home use -...RecommendedBest rice cookers : how to make great rice every time, w...RecommendedHome office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have w...RecommendedAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is about to be back in stoc...RecommendedMonthly flower subscriptions UK : our favourites, includ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
