This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without the consent.’      Previously, both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have alleged that Kavanaugh engaged in serious sexual misconduct.

Nando\u0027s deny the brown liquid is sewage and say it was \u0027most likely\u0027 from an upstairs kitchen\u0027The smell of sewage waste was over bearing.\u0027  In the video, liquid can be seen on the floor of the restaurant right beside the plate warming racks where customers\u0027 food is taken by waiting staff.Mr Speary added: \u0027This happened in the Nando’s in the O2 at north Greenwich I was out having dinner with my partner, I believe it was the toilets as they are above and the smell of urine and faeces was really strong.\u0027I noticed when I went to refill my drink and drops were dripping on my shoulder and shoes accompanied by a foul smell and noticed the plates waiting to be taken to peoples\u0027 tables were on the receiving end of the droplets that you can see in the video.\u0027          Staff put up wet floor signs and a spokesperson said the area was closed for trading The 24-year-old added: \u0027The staff didn’t want to discuss the issue when asked as if they were hiding something .

Now, more than 53 years later, Schatzberg is releasing a book titled Dylan By Schatzberg that showcases a comprehensive collection of both photos and countless stories. Dylan is pictured above posing inside of Schatzberg photography studio in 1965          For more than six decades,  Schatzberg has used his camera lens to capture dozens of A-listers, artists, politicians and elite musicians. Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Andy Warhol, Sammy Davis Jr., Duke of Windsor (the abdicated King Edward VIII) and Ted Kennedy have all posed for him. But of all the high-profile iniduals the 91-year-old photographer has interacted with,  Dylan was his best photographic subject. As Schatzberg says: \u0027You just point the camera at him and things happen.\u0027 The singer is pictured above in a photo while smoking a cigarette in 1965          Schatzberg shared that the pair became fast friends and would often hang out together along with other musicians at restaurants or night clubs. The photographer remarked that people have often asked if the out-of-focus image on the cover of Blonde on Blonde represented a drug trip. It doesn\u0027t. They were just really, really cold. \u0027It was something that actually is an honest image. He was cold and I was shaking, I was cold and the camera was shaking,\u0027 he said. Pictured above is another image taken of Dylan from the same shoot for the Blonde on Blonde cover in the Meat Packing District of Manhattan Schatzberg was so moved that he asked a mutual friend if the musician would agree to being photographed. The next day he was surprised to receive a phone call from Dylan\u0027s then-wife, Sara Dylan. Her husband had agreed. \u0027I showed up the next day and he was great,\u0027 Schatzberg said of his initial encounter with Dylan in a recording studio in 1965. \u0027Immediately he wanted me to hear something that he had just recorded. I was a little intimidated, but it was great.\u0027Schatzberg explained that after showing him the first set of photos he captured with his Nikon camera  that Dylan liked them and agreed to being photographed more by Schatzberg, who was then aged 38 and had already shot covers for Vogue, Life, Esquire and Glamour.\u0027The first set of pictures were done in the studio pretty much under his control. …He would feel at home in the recording studio where he knows everything that\u0027s going on. And so I asked him to come to my studio and he said yeah,\u0027 Schatzberg said.\u0027I didn\u0027t tell him that I wanted him to come to my studio because I have more control there. I wanted to be the boss. \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship. He was just like anybody else. He was very funny and he\u0027s a very special talent.\u0027          Schatzberg, pictured above at home in his apartment with his new book, remarked: \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship. He was just like anybody else. He was very funny and he\u0027s a very special talent\u0027          During some of Dylan\u0027s early performances, Schatzberg recounted how he did not always receive rave reviews from his audiences. When Dylan showcased a few new songs from his album Highway 61 Revisited while performing on August 28, 1965, he was booed. \u0027He said \u0027f*** \u0027em, I don\u0027t care\u0027 in response to being booed. He knew what he wanted to do with his music – he was a country singer, folk singer and that\u0027s a certain style,\u0027 Schatzberg said.

It was the beginning of February 1966, so it was very cold and he was wearing a light jacket,\u0027 he recalled of the chilly weather, which can be as low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 Celsius). \u0027So I asked him if he would go outside because I didn\u0027t like the shots I was getting into the studio. It was okay, but it wasn\u0027t something special. So he said yeah and had on a little jacket.          Of Dylan, Schatzberg said: \u0027I think of him as one of my greatest subject matters and I protect that a lot. I still do today, I just won\u0027t give my pictures to everybody or sell them to everybody.\u0027 Dylan is pictured above holding a picture frame as prop inside Schatzberg\u0027s photography studio in the mid-1960s          Schatzberg said, \u0027He\u0027s just got something to him and I felt working with him and knowing him, I was able to get into his soul and get deeper into him and a lot of my photographs I look at them and I find them amazing.\u0027 The Blowing in the Wind singer is pictured above looking deeply into the camera in another image captured by Schatzberg inside his studio           Schatzberg said that Dylan is \u0027a very special talent\u0027 and the images that are included of him in his new book showcase that.

Now after her death last year aged 91 he has been told he will be getting his hands on £139,000.Last night Marney, who was not among mourners at Mrs Perott’s funeral, told the Mail that he planned to celebrate by taking his wife on holiday to Benidorm for a month.The gardener, who denies any wrongdoing, said: ‘I had a lot of trouble after all the argy-bargy. I was a year under investigation for this – £200,000 taken from an old lady, 88-year-old with dementia, and I ain’t been charged and nicked for it. I ain’t done anything wrong. That’s why I’m not in prison, innit? I didn’t go to the funeral – I was told to stay away.’Marney added: ‘I got a letter three or four months ago – I was told I was going to get £139,000. When I finally get the money I’m going to put it in my pocket then take my wife on holiday for a month to Benidorm.’He said a solicitor appointed to protect Mrs Perott’s interests had negotiated with him over the £325,000 will. Disabled man, 40, is found GUILTY of assaulting two old...Pictured: Disabled man, 40, who \u0027used mobility scooter to...Share this articleHe agreed to increase the widow’s bequests to her church and a monastery in return for being allowed to get £139,000 himself without threat of a legal challenge.Last night a spokesmen for the Court of Protection and the Official Solicitor refused to explain why the discredited gardener had been allowed to benefit so handsomely.Childless Mrs Perott had worked for the BBC World Service for decades. She married Mstislav Perott, whose parents had fled Russia after the 1917 revolution, and became an active volunteer in the Russian Orthodox Church in the UK.After Mr Perott died 20 years ago, she at first remained living in the large marital house in Barons Court, West London.But in 2005 she sold the house – now worth £2million – for £425,000, and moved 20 miles to a council estate in St Mary Cray, South East London, where she had no friends or family.          Former BBC World Service secretary Daphne Perott, who hired Marney to mow her tiny lawn in South East London in 2006A judge investigating her case said there was a suggestion that ‘she may have been the victim of financial abuse’ over the move. Once in St Mary Cray, she descended into dementia. In 2006 she hired Marney, from Crayford, to look after the miniature garden behind her cramped former council house.Exactly how much control he had over her finances only became clear in 2014 when social workers raised concerns and a special hearing took place at the secretive Court of Protection in London. Judge Denzil Lush found that as the woman’s condition worsened, she gave Marney power of attorney in 2011. It was not long before he paid himself a gift of £38,000 out of her account, drew a bankers draft for £1,500, and used her cash card to take out £8,500 he could not account for.After she was taken into a care home in 2012, he promptly sold her house for £165,000 – and paid the lot into a bank account in his own name. He also used the vulnerable woman’s money to get his wife Susan, 71, a new Nissan Qashqai car.Judge Lush stripped him of the power of attorney. The £165,000 was frozen. Marney, who claimed the £165,000 was to pay Mrs Perott’s care home fees, was not charged with any offence and was still due to receive 80 per cent of her estate.Out of her total estate of £325,000, £60,000 goes to the Russian Orthodox Church and £60,000 to a monastery. Russian Orthodox cathedral administrator Vera McClenaghan last night said she was astonished Marney was getting so much from the will, adding: ‘He tried to take over her house and money.’A spokesman for the Official Solicitor refused to comment on the case, but said it was ready to intervene when any of the 2.6million people with powers of attorney were reported to be abusing their power. "},{"url":null,"title":"Amal Clooney begs Myanmars Aung San Suu Kyi release journalists reported Rohingya massacre","story":"    International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney speaks during a conference called Press Behind Bars: Undermining Justice and Democracy          Barrister Amal Clooney pleaded with Myanmar\u0027s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi to realse two Reuters journalists held by her government          Thhe speech at the UN event in New York to make the case the men should be pardoned          Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler alongside Mrs Clooney.

Balmoral: Five weeks without a bagpiper giving the 9am alarm call for 15 minutes‘People can hear the pipes around the estate. It creates a really lovely, evocative atmosphere and sets you up for the day.‘For the Queen, who hears the noise most days, it must seem very odd. She often has her breakfast and reads the papers while the piper is playing.‘It is just part of her normal day and I expect she looks forward to getting a new one but she totally understood Scott’s position. He is incredibly highly regarded by the Royal Household and the Royal Family.’The position of Piper to the Sovereign was established after Queen Victoria discovered that the Marquess of Breadalbane had his own personal piper.  Predecessors: Alexander MacDonald, left, (1945-1966) and Andrew Pitkeathly (1966-1973)Traditionally, the post is held by a serving non-commissioned officer and Pipe Major from a Scottish or Irish Regiment.Of the 15 pipers, 11 have been in the present Queen’s reign, including Alexander MacDonald, who served from 1945 to 1966, and his successor Andrew Pitkeathly, who served until 1973.The piper’s principal duty is to play under the Queen’s window when she is at Buckingham Palace, Windsor, Holyroodhouse or Balmoral, but he also co-ordinates Army pipers who play after state banquets and escorts the Queen to the audiences she has throughout the day.A new piper is now hurriedly being lined up and will, it is hoped, start when the Queen returns to London after her holiday in Scotland.Pipers are personally interviewed by the monarch to see if their personalities will match, as the two interact so regularly. It is said her piper travels with her even more than her husband.Most remain tight-lipped about their posts but Gordon Webster, who held the title in the 1990s, once said: ‘Because the Queen doesn’t like you repeating the same tunes every day I had about 700 stored in my head.’ And Max Stewart, who has also piped for the Queen, said: ‘At Balmoral you have got to try to not repeat a tune the whole trip – which is quite an achievement.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/21/4FD8ED0200000578-0-image-a-67_1536351806576.jpg","title":"Princes former chef half sister open performer final days","story":"    Family and a former employee of Prince have opened up about their growing concerns for the musical sensation, leading up to his death in 2016.

Making this radio programme, I met a number of my contemporaries and found that we had very similar stocks of stored memories.Michael Rosen (poet and former Children\u0027s Laureate) and I overlapped at university and, 50 years on, found ourselves able to recite, in unison, Shelley\u0027s Ozymandias — or at least the beginning of it:\u0027I met a traveller from an antique land,Who said — \u0027Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert . . .\u0027I began my research with the Duchess of Cornwall. She has recently taken over from the Queen as patron of the Royal Society of Literature and kindly invited me for tea at Clarence House.She\u0027s easy company: chatty, forthcoming, unselfconscious, unpretentious, an enthusiastic reader, with a real passion for poetry.Her taste in poetry isn\u0027t as conventional as I had expected. She knew Ted Hughes and he read some of his poetry to her children.One of her favourite poems is The Christmas Truce by the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy. \u0027It moved me to tears,\u0027 she told me.Was poetry part of her childhood? I asked. \u0027Very much so,\u0027 she said. \u0027My mother loved poetry. Her favourite was Right Royal by John Masefield.\u0027 It\u0027s a narrative poem that tells the story of a steeplechase, the winning horse and the jockey\u0027s relationship with his beloved which is placed in jeopardy by the race — all rather apt, I suggested, given the Duchess\u0027s love of horses and her own royal story.  Poetry was very much a part of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall\u0027s childhoodShe laughed and agreed.\u0027At school, I had a Scottish teacher who got me into Burns.\u0027My heart\u0027s in the Highlands,my heart\u0027s not here …\u0027\u0027And a wonderful teacher who read to us from Chaucer\u0027s Canterbury Tales.\u0027Her favourites from her schooldays include Christina Rossetti, Walter de la Mare, John Betjeman (of course), but not Byron.\u0027But I love the poetry of Oscar Wilde. I still read Wilde.\u0027The poems that have stayed with the Duchess are \u0027the poems with rhyme and rhythm\u0027.Leaning forward towards the microphone, brow slightly furrowed, she launched into W H Auden\u0027s Night Mail:\u0027This is the night mail crossingthe Border,Bringing the cheque and thepostal order,Letters for the rich, letters forthe poor,The shop at the corner, the girlnext door …\u0027Can she remember the first poem she learned as a girl? \u0027Oh yes, definitely, Matilda\u0027 — one of Hilaire Belloc\u0027s Cautionary Tales designed \u0027for the Admonition of Children between the ages of eight and 14\u0027.\u0027Matilda told such Dreadful Lies, It made one Gasp and Stretch one\u0027s Eyes\u0027 . . . I think I was made to learn it because of some fib I\u0027d told. I can still remember most of it.\u0027I put the Duchess to the test and she managed a good few lines, without resorting to the copy of Belloc she\u0027d brought with her.\u0027It\u0027s not so easy when you\u0027re under pressure. I knew it all last night,\u0027 she told me.\u0027It\u0027s much easier for you because you\u0027re an actor.\u0027Only now and then but I do know someone who is indisputably the real thing, so leaving the Duchess (more of whom later), I went on to see Dame Judi Dench.I found her in her country garden, enjoying the late summer sunshine, sitting with a friend who was helping her learn her lines for her next screen role.She was in a happy mood and, though it was only mid-morning, generously offered me champagne (which I declined) and an avocado (which I accepted: I am on a low-carb diet).What was the first poetry Dame Judi had learned by heart? Was it A A Milne? Or Hilaire Belloc? Or Edward Lear?\u0027Oh, no. It was Shakespeare. Even when I was very little, I knew lots and lots of Shakespeare.\u0027I don\u0027t know if I understood much of it, but I loved it.\u0027I learnt lots of Shakespeare when I was a girl: the plays, the sonnets. I can give you lots of sonnets — and I can do all of Twelfth Night and all of A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream, every word, I promise you.\u0027I believe her. Her love of Shakespeare is palpable. \u0027My sight\u0027s going now,\u0027 she said. \u0027If we had to go on stage now and read a sonnet, you\u0027d have it written on just one page, but for me the print would be so big I\u0027d need 14 pages.\u0027 She laughs, but she\u0027s not joking.\u0027Now I learn my lines with my friend, Pen. She reads me the lines and I repeat them. I can\u0027t drive any more and I find that difficult, but I manage. But I couldn\u0027t live without Shakespeare.\u0027Dame Judi has reams of poetry in her head and, like the Duchess, agrees that it\u0027s the stuff with rhythm and rhyme that\u0027s easiest to remember.\u0027Shakespeare\u0027s verse goes with the beat of your heart,\u0027 she says —and she\u0027s right.Which brings us to the science — and the important bit.In the Memory Laboratory at Cambridge University\u0027s Department for Neuroscience in Education, I found Professor Usha Goswami. With an Indian father and German mother, and clearly a bit of genius herself, she\u0027s doing extraordinary work that one day may help find a cure for dyslexia.Her research provides measurable proof of what my gut instinct has long told me: as you start out in life, having your parents recite poetry and sing songs to you will help you with your linguistic skills as you grow older, learning poetry will, without question, keep dementia at bay.You will find the detail in her learned paper, A Neural Basis For Phonological Awareness? An Oscillatory Temporal Sampling Perspective, published by the Association of Psychological Science.Professor Goswami has been studying what goes on inside the brains of babies and young children — measuring the neural oscillations (the brainwaves as it were) that encode the signals through which we begin to learn and understand speech.The metrical structures and rhythmic patterns of nursery rhymes coincide with the brain\u0027s neural oscillations — starting with a trochaic rhythm (as in the beat of \u0027The cat sat on the mat\u0027) and quickly going on to the rhythm of the iambic pentameter (as in Shakespeare\u0027s verse) which explains why Dame Judi Dench could quite easily have been spouting Shakespeare from the age of three or four.The professor and her team can measure the speech-sound awareness of babies, toddlers and young children and, on the basis of the data, accurately predict speech, reading and (wait for it!) even spelling development. Never mind the scientific gobbledygook, what the professor\u0027s studies establish is that the more you recite poetry to your children — before they are born as well — the better they will be able to communicate, both when it comes to spoken and, later, even when it comes to written language. It\u0027s amazing stuff.Why do we remember best the poems we learnt as children, I asked the professor?\u0027First in, last out, is the principle of it,\u0027 she explained. And why is the stuff we\u0027ve learned later more difficult to recall?\u0027It\u0027s all still in there,\u0027 she said, reassuringly. \u0027It\u0027s just sometimes difficult to retrieve because there is so much in there.\u0027The brain is a computer into which we are loading more and more stuff as the years go by. Those \u0027senior moments\u0027 occur not because we have lost anything but because it has been temporarily mislaid. It\u0027s a retrieval issue, not a memory one. Concentration should be able to bring it back.\u0027At whatever age you are,\u0027 according to the professor, \u0027you still have the capacity to learn new things if you put your mind to it. There\u0027s no shortage of brain cells as you grow older.\u0027Recent research from the department of neurobiology at Columbia University has established that new brain cells grow as quickly when you are in your 70s as when you are in your 20s.According to the scientists at Columbia, gradual mental decline \u0027is not the inevitable process many of us think it is\u0027.They found this after counting the number of new cells growing in the hippocampus — the part of the brain that processes memories and emotions. They found that around 700 brain cells were created each day even in the oldest people they studied, and that there was no difference in the hippocampus in young and old brains.Back at Cambridge University, Professor Goswami is unequivocal: learning poetry by heart is good for the brain.\u0027You\u0027ve got the keep the brain active. The exercise and discipline of learning a poem by heart is certainly going to help keep dementia at bay,\u0027 she says.Did you hear that? There is no excuse. If you want to do it, you can. The great actress Dame Sybil Thorndike lived into her 90s and made herself learn a new poem every day of her life to keep her brain active.Dame Judi Dench, 83, is learning hers for her next film. Dame Maggie Smith, 83, has just learnt hers for the Downton Abbey film she\u0027s currently making. And my friend Nicholas Parsons, 95 next month, is not only as razor-sharp as ever on Radio 4\u0027s Just A Minute, he is also touring with a one-man show about Edward Lear in which he recites poem after poem after poem after poem — and doesn\u0027t hesitate once.Learning poetry by heart will make you a better parent and give you a longer, mentally-active life. Fact.The Duchess of Cornwall agrees.\u0027Of course, it\u0027s good for you — it\u0027s good for everyone. It helps ward off dementia and that\u0027s wonderful.\u0027It helps young children with their language skills and that\u0027s wonderful, too.\u0027According to everyone I met making my radio programme, the poems that are easiest to learn are ones with a strong rhythm — and ones you have a feeling for.\u0027You\u0027ve got to love the poem you want to learn,\u0027 said Michael Rosen.For her part, Professor Goswami explained that you need to learn your poem by saying it out loud. Hearing the words and feeling the rhythm are important.Pick a poem you like and speak it out loud, then learn it, repeating it line by line, in the shower, in the kitchen, in the car or out of doors when you are on a walk.I have seven grandchildren and for Christmas I want each of them to learn a poem for me. Michael Rosen suggests Benjamin Zephaniah\u0027s \u0027Be nice to yu turkeys dis Christmas\u0027 Dame Judi hopes at least one of them tries a Shakespeare sonnet the Duchess recommends any of Hilaire Belloc\u0027s Cautionary Tales.It will be a challenge, but if they manage it, the poems they will learn will be with them for the rest of their lives — good companions jostling around in the rattle bags of their minds.And if the grandchildren can do it, so can the grandparents.Whatever your age, for the sake of your mind learn a poem by heart before Christmas. Poetry By Heart is on Radio 4 tomorrow at 1.30 pm. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/25/13/50A5F0FA00000578-0-image-m-10_1537879156997.jpg","title":"Why Donatella Versace selling family label giants Michael Kors","story":"    Donatella Versace, Carla Bruni, Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Helena Christensen on the catwalkVersace show, Runway, Spring Summer 2018, Milan Fashion WeekMichael Kors snaps up fashion house Versace in $2.1billion...Share this articleYet, this week, it appeared she was doing just that, when it was announced that Versace has been sold to U.S. clothing giant Michael Kors for an astonishing £1.6 billion.No wonder eyebrows were raised as far as the sartorial set’s Botox would allow, with fans scorning an acquisition they said would ‘ruin’ the brand and ‘kill’ the exclusive image on which it built its success.Michael Kors, which last year bought Jimmy Choo for nearly £900 million, plans to open 100 new Versace boutiques in a bid to double sales, focus more on the lucrative accessories market and combine all three brands into a company called Capri Holdings, of which Donatella will lead the ‘creative vision’.The mother of two, who owns the label with her other brother Santo, 73, and daughter Allegra, 32, insists the label had to be sold in order for it to ‘reach its full potential’.She also stressed her ‘passion’ has ‘never been stronger’ — although passion for what is unclear. Was she referring to her passion for Versace or for the £200 million winging into her bank account following the takeover? Her passion for the luxury holidays she loves to share on Instagram, and will now have more time for — or her passion for her family, which has, at times, appeared pushed to breaking point by the cut-throat fashion world?Either her decision to step back has been sudden or kept a fiercely guarded secret. Last September, she was emphatic about staying in her role, saying: ‘I’m not going anywhere right now,’ and, in an interview this month, Donatella waxed lyrical about her beloved brand without so much as a hint.So, what possessed her to hand over the reins of her company?          Gianni Versace with his sister Donatella Versace in 1993. She would inherit the brand after his deathA FUTURE SET IN STONE FROM BIRTHThe daughter of an Italian seamstress, Donatella grew up idolising Gianni, eight years her senior. ‘He made cool leather mini-skirts for me, took me to discos and treated me like a woman,’ she has recalled. ‘I was his doll and his best friend.’Describing her youth as ‘the happiest time of my life’ she was, nonetheless, shackled by her sibling’s success and denied autonomy from an early age.By the time she’d completed a languages degree, Gianni, who founded Versace in 1978, was already a successful designer and Donatella’s fate had been sealed: ‘I finished university and just ran to work with him. Actually, I didn’t have a choice. He said: “You come and you don’t move any more.” ’Perhaps, after having her entire life mapped out, Donatella has finally snapped.BLINDSIDED BY HER BROTHER’S MURDERAs Gianni’s ‘accomplice’ and muse, Donatella schmoozed the stars as Santo took charge of Versace’s business side. Helped by the Versace-clad, newly coined ‘supermodels’ who strutted the catwalk singing George Michael’s Freedom in 1991 and that safety pin dress Elizabeth Hurley wore in 1994, Versace’s status was consolidated.But, on July 15, 1997, the openly gay designer was shot outside his Miami mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who apparently was jealous of Gianni’s success. Cunanan then took his own life.‘The sight of my dead brother haunts me to this day. One bullet hit his neck, the other his face,’ said Donatella, who was then married to American model Paul Beck, with whom she had Allegra and a son Daniel, now 28.She was shaken both by grief and the responsibility of having her brother’s company foisted upon her, in what she has suggested was an unfair ruse: Gianni, who idolised Allegra, then aged just 11, had left his niece 50 per cent of the company in his will, while Donatella inherited 20 per cent and Santo 30 per cent.In so doing, Donatella says, he not only ‘put a tremendous burden’ on Allegra, but effectively trapped his sister: ‘By giving half of Versace to my daughter, he forced me to take responsibility for the company until she came of age.‘Without this trick, I might have left the company after his death.’          Versace store in Milan. Michael Kors plans to open 900 more Versace stores to double salesDOUBTS, DEBTS AND A DRUG HABITNow in charge, Donatella’s early collections were panned. Having taken cocaine since her 20s, her escalating addiction became an open secret in the industry and her leadership style erratic.According to Deborah Ball, author of the book House Of Versace, Donatella rarely turned up to meetings before noon and, on occasion, openly snorted cocaine in front of staff. ‘For the first five years, I was lost,’ Donatella later admitted. ‘I made a lot of mistakes.’Having boasted sales of more than £400 million in 1997, by 2004 the company was facing debts of around £90 million. Its clothes, capitalising on a Nineties era of conspicuous consumption, seemed increasingly irrelevant in the restrained Noughties and, by the middle of the decade, the business was close to going under.‘I wanted to succeed for Gianni, because he cared so much for the company and I knew he would have wanted it to carry on,’ said Donatella.‘But I was frightened and I had no confidence.’ADDICTION LED TO ELTON’S INTERVENTIONDonatella discovered cocaine in the Eighties at celebrity-studded parties, admitting it fuelled the ‘best time’.According to Gianni’s former partner of 15 years, Antonio D’Amico, the designer was ‘furious’ when he found out about his sister’s habit from their mutual friend, Elton John.‘He was shocked,’ says D’Amico, who describes Donatella as a ‘monster’, on account of her difficult behaviour, and says she ‘became angry, frustrated and suspicious of the people around her. She was very difficult to deal with’. In 2004, during Allegra’s 18th birthday party dinner in Milan, Elton arrived to drag Donatella off to a rehab clinic in Arizona by private plane, where she remained for two-and-a-half months.Donatella says: ‘Some evenings, I couldn’t function any more and embarrassed myself in front of my children. My self-hatred became more and more intense.‘Nobody thought I would accept Elton’s offer, but a few minutes later, I traded my evening gown and diamonds for a jogging suit.‘I made my way to the airport with a ponytail and no make-up.’SAVED BY HER FEMININE REVOLUTIONAFTER emerging from rehab, Donatella focused on collections that contained less of her brother’s brash exhibitionism and were, as she put it, ‘more feminine’. The strategy worked: in 2006, the label posted profits of £14.2 million and, in 2007, sales rose 30 per cent.Recent decisions have proved similarly successful, from the appointment of British CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, hired from Alexander McQueen in 2016, to Donatella dressing her friend and model-of-the-moment Gigi Hadid in a skintight Versace jumpsuit this year. ‘My revolution was successful,’ Donatella said, her pride in the transformation clear-cut — her decision to cash in now less so.CHILDREN WHO SHUN THE LIMELIGHTGiven that Donatella describes Allegra and Daniel as her ‘greatest achievement’, it must be painful that both are deeply uncomfortable in the limelight. They are perhaps the biggest reason for selling up.Allegra — who stands to inherit some £558 million after the Versace sale goes through — is a director of the company, but is not believed to have any great involvement in it. She used her father’s surname to escape her legacy, but admitted in 2011: ‘Anywhere I went, I was Versace. I couldn’t escape and it did me harm.’Daniel, a musician living in London who inherited his uncle’s art collection, is similarly keen to distance himself from his mother.‘He doesn’t want people to know he is my son,’ Donatella has said, admitting that she had promised not to talk about him publicly.          \u0027I\u0027m more of a private jet pooch\u0027 said Audrey Versace, Donatella\u0027s a dogLOVE AFFAIRS AND ‘GORGEOUS GUYS’predatory in her approach to men, yet tight-lipped about her love life, Donatella might want to distance herself from Versace so that she can date in secret.Not that she shows much intention of settling down.‘Men are needed only for love affairs and for physical relaxation,’ she said recently, adding that there have been ‘others’ since her 2000 orce but that: ‘I don’t need a husband or companion. I don’t like to live with anybody. I’m very happy and fulfilled with my private life.’After orcing Beck following 17 years together, she has made little comment about the marriage, other than to say they are ‘estranged’, but ‘civilised’.Her reported second marriage, in 2004, to businessman Manuel Dallori, lasted just a year and has been kept even more secret.She is, however, vociferous about her appreciation for the male form, sizing up a line-up of semi-naked male models on a tongue-in-cheek Instagram video and declaring unashamedly that: ‘I love being surrounded by gorgeous guys.’‘MASK’ OF BLONDE HAIR AND MAKE-UPHaving first had highlights on the instruction of Gianni at the age of 11, her peroxide locks — at times enhanced to waist-length with extensions — are synonymous with her high-maintenance brand: her hairstyle, perma-tan and trademark black kohl-lined eyes an attempt to present a competent façade, especially during times of crisis.‘My hair got blonder and blonder, my make-up thicker and thicker,’ she recalls of the period following her brother’s death.‘I felt like the whole world was looking at me with daggers in their eyes and I created a mask that would give me protection.’Having created ‘a second Donatella: cold and aloof, aggressive and scary’, she says she hasn’t been tempted to change her hairstyle because ‘blonde is a way of life. I survived the catastrophes in my life because of the strength that my blonde hair gives me’.          Donatella Versace (pictured) had this message for fans after Michael Kors bought the brandPROTEIN AND EIGHT ESPRESSOS A DAY At a diminutive 5ft 2in, Donatella says she feels ‘naked’ without high heels — indeed, she even wore them to rehab.Her whippet-thin frame, typically showcased in skintight jeans and dresses from her own line, is the result of ‘hard work’ — she claims to have exercised every day for the past 18 years ‘for at least five minutes’ and does a 45-minute cardio and weights routine four times a week.Donatella — who quit her two packets of Marlboro Red habit in 2013 — once said she stopped seeing a personal trainer because he wouldn’t let her smoke.As for her diet, lunch is salad and protein, with eight espressos a day as well as iced water sipped from a crystal glass to sustain her.PALATIAL HOMES AND LUXURY HOLIDAYSHome for Donatella is a palatial two-storey Milan flat that used to belong to Gianni, with marble columns, gold furnishings and vases of her favourite red roses.Holidays are gleefully showcased to her 3.5 million Instagram followers, from the tour she filmed of her private pool in the Palazzo Versace in Dubai — the £500 million neoclassical palace she opened in 2016 — to the video of her on a yacht with an unidentified topless hunk, and the picture of her lying bikini-clad on her back in aquamarine water, alongside the caption: ‘Wake me up when August ends.’One can only imagine she might get used to a life of leisure. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/16/20/4F248ED000000578-0-image-m-96_1534446168046.jpg","title":"Queen Mary thought new Downton movie fans point similarity royal actress","story":"    Dame Maggie Smith, who plays Violet Crawley and Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham, have been spotted filming scenes for the  Downton Abbey film and standing next to actress Geraldine James (in blue) - whose character has not been confirmed - but looks remarkably similar to Queen Mary.

Two houses were completely obliterated along with their inhabitants.It is a tragic irony that Flight 103 had become a sort of ‘student special’ after a terror threat to US airlines was relayed to all American diplomats in Europe with the result that many cancelled their reservations.                            Incompetence, vengeance and a cover-up at the highest levels                         The empty seats were offered at cheap rates by student travel agencies. More than half of the passengers, 137, were under 30 and many had called their parents excitedly before they boarded, saying how lucky they had been to get a cheap seat just before Christmas.That is how Dr Jim Swire, a Worcestershire GP, and his wife Jane learned that their daughter Flora was booked on the flight, heading across the Atlantic to see her boyfriend.With a loss of 259 lives on board and 11 more on the ground, the destruction of Maid of the Seas, blown up by a terrorist bomb on December 21, 1988, was the worst civil aviation disaster in British history. Yet 30 years later, we still do not officially know who is responsible for mass murder high in the air above a small Scottish market town preparing for Christmas.          Iran\u0027s former interior minister Ali Akbar Mohtasamipur authorised and financed the bombing, according to the USIt is nothing short of a scandal.There was, of course, a fall guy. Eleven years after the atrocity, a 47-year-old Libyan Arab Airlines security officer called Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted on a tissue of lies which centred on the evidence of a Maltese shopkeeper who claimed to remember him buying clothes similar to those that may have been in the suitcase with the bomb that would rip through the fuselage.A low-level Libyan CIA ‘asset’ called Abdul Majid Giaka said he recalled seeing al-Megrahi collect a brown Samsonite suitcase from the Arrivals carousel in Malta’s Luqa airport on December 20, 1988. On the following morning, he alleged, the unaccompanied suitcase was loaded on to a flight to Frankfurt, from where it would be transferred to London on a Pan Am ‘feeder flight’ and loaded aboard Flight 103 – before then exploding.A further 11 years later, al-Megrahi was sentenced to life imprisonment at an extraordinary trial held in a disused American air base near Utrecht, Holland.                            Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the bombing                         After years investigating the Lockerbie disaster and its background, I have found that little of the evidence against him can be taken at face value. Instead, a very different story has emerged from the morass of lies, one that should have been apparent from the very start.It is a story of incompetence, vengeance, political expediency and then a cover-up orchestrated from the very highest levels in London and in Washington – where the real bomber is said to live today, under the cover of an American witness protection scheme.In the days and months after the crash, thousands of police, military personnel and specialised investigators from Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch scoured southern Scotland, finding debris over an area of 1,500 square miles. Investigators from the US Federal Aviation Authority and the FBI took part. Representatives of the CIA were present for reasons not ulged. Charred material said to have been found some weeks after the bombing in woods near Lockerbie was sent for analysis to Fort Halstead in Kent, the Ministry of Defence research establishment, where senior scientific officer Thomas Hayes identified bits of black plastic, metal and wire mesh as parts of a Toshiba radio-cassette player. It had contained a bomb and a small piece of circuit board that Hayes believed to be the remnants of a timer. After three years of the joint BritishUS investigation, this and other evidence pointed in one clear direction: an obscure terrorist group called the People’s Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC). Sleeper cells from the organisation had been arrested in a series of raids in Germany a few weeks before Lockerbie, in which bombs hidden in Toshiba radio-cassette players had been seized alongside a fearsome arsenal of explosives, firearms and ammunition.          Ahmed Jibril was the founder and commander of the Palestinian terror group that carried out the bombingShortly after the disaster, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, keen to boost its credentials as a political rather than terrorist organisation, published an 80-page report claiming the PFLP-GC had been paid to blow up the plane – by Iran.It also named a man called Abu Elias as a prime suspect for breaking into the Pan Am baggage store in Heathrow and planting the bomb. The baggage handling area had been broken into with bolt croppers shortly before Flight 103 took off.Years later, of course, the world would be persuaded to accept a very different story. But in September 1989, the evidence of Iranian guilt seemed so clear that the US Defense Intelligence Agency issued a public statement saying: ‘The bombing of the Pan Am flight was conceived, authorised and financed by Ali-Akbar Mohtashamipur, Iran’s former interior minister. The execution of the operation was contracted to Ahmad Jibril, leader of the PFLP-GC.’                            They agreed a price for the attack: £7.7million                         INDEED, the fate of the passengers and crew of Flight 103 was sealed not in Libya but five months earlier in Tehran after the shooting down of an Iran Air Airbus A300 by the American warship USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988.The Vincennes, sailing illegally in Iranian waters, inexplicably mistook the passenger jet for a hostile fighter, despite the fact it was climbing in Iranian airspace and its transponder clearly identified it as a civilian aircraft. All 290 people on board were killed.According to a former Iranian intelligence officer, Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini responded by ordering a ‘qisas’ – a like-for-like punishment under Sharia law – that required the destruction of an American aircraft in revenge.          Jordanian bomb-maker Marwan Khreesat built the explosive device hidden inside a Toshiba radio-cassette playerIran needed a deniable proxy and its intelligence service knew who to turn to: the PFLP-GC, with whom it had discussed collaboration a few months earlier. The group’s leader, Ahmed Jibril, was a Palestine-born former Syrian Army officer linked to Syrian and Soviet intelligence.He, in turn, hired Jordanian explosives expert Marwan Khreesat to design a bomb that could pass through airport luggage checks and, for preference, detonate over water, destroying the aircraft, killing all on board and leaving no clues. The terrorist group had already proved its bomb could work – blowing up a Swissair flight on February 21, 1970, killing all 47 passengers and crew, and an Austrian Airlines jet the same day, which managed to land safely at Frankfurt airport.When news of the qisas reached Lebanon, Jibril called Tehran and offered to execute it.It is likely that the US National Security Agency and Israeli interceptors monitored the unencrypted phone call. Evidence exists that the price agreed was in the region of £7.7 million – £1.5 million on the handshake and the balance on completion.And so, in 1988, Jibril sent a key lieutenant, 30-year-old Hafaz Mohammed Hussein Dalkamoni to the PFLP-GC’s European headquarters in the Serbian town of Krusevac, where weapons, explosives and other material were stored. His mission was to activate Jibril’s several sleeper cells in Germany. The following month, bomb-maker Khreesat was despatched to Neuss, near Dusseldorf, where the German police photographed a stream of his visitors, including a known PFLP-GC courier.Suspicions grew that an attack on Frankfurt airport – near which other members of the cell had a base – was being planned.The team were observed buying radios and computer equipment, batteries, switches, alarm clocks and cable.Telephone calls were monitored to a kebab restaurant in Cyprus, which functioned as a postbox for Jibril. And in a call to Damascus bomb-maker Khreesat said he had made changes to ‘the medicine’, which was now ‘stronger than before’.In fact, Khreesat built five bombs, concealed inside Toshiba radio-cassette players, each containing a barometric switch that started a timer when the pressure inside the plane fell to a pre-set level, meaning the aircraft would be destroyed around 38 minutes into the flight – a clear match to the Lockerbie explosion. On October 24, in a call to Amman, Jordan, Khreesat said he would be done in a few days.                            Gaddafi was actually happy to take the blame                         After a CIA warning of an imminent terror attack, the German police launched raids on a dozen apartments, including the ones at Neuss and Frankfurt.Khreesat and Dalkamoni and a dozen others were arrested in possession of an extraordinary haul of weapons and bomb- making equipment.Their car contained blasting caps and an alarm clock modified to serve as a timing device – and a Toshiba radio-cassette player already converted into a bomb.Five kilos of the Czech-made explosive Semtex were also taken away, with 5.7 kilos of another unidentified plastic explosive, three kilos of TNT and 89 detonators.How was it, then, that Libya came to take the blame, in the face of such overwhelming evidence, and why?          Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines, was sentenced to life in 2001, but released in 2009The answer lies in Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, which prompted the First Gulf War – for which Washington and London needed the compliance of Iraq’s neighbours Iran and Syria.A plausible new Lockerbie suspect had to be found and, conveniently, in June 1991 a CIA officer had ‘a hunch’ that the IranPFLP-GC theory was a false lead.Instead, he saw similarities between Lockerbie and the arrest in Senegal of two Libyans carrying 20lb of explosives and triggering devices like the one from which the Lockerbie fragments had apparently come.The theory gained traction because of Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi’s known financial support for terrorists, including the IRA, and because it turned out that Gaddafi himself was happy to accept the blame.Libya had been an international pariah under strict economic sanctions since the murder of British PC Yvonne Fletcher, shot dead in London in 1984, and it was the prospect of the lifting of these sanctions that led Gaddafi’s intelligence service to find a plausible scapegoat.The 47-year-old airline security officer Abdelbaset al-Megrahi fitted the bill. He had been abroad on business on December 20-21, passing though Malta’s Luqa airport on both days.All that was needed was evidence. Fortunately, the CIA had a very low-level Libyan ‘asset’, Abdul Majid Giaka, on secondment from his job as a mechanic for Gaddafi’s intelligence service to Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta.After a large reward was offered for information about the Lockerbie bombers, Giaka suddenly volunteered that he had seen al-Megrahi collect a brown Samsonite suitcase from the arrivals carousel in Luqa airport on December 20, 1988. The following morning, he alleged, the suitcase was loaded on to a flight to Frankfurt, from where it would be transferred to London on a Pan Am transfer and loaded aboard Flight 103.Giaka became a star prosecution witness alongside Maltese shopkeeper Tony Gauci, who testified he had sold clothes similar to those found close to the bomb to a man fitting al-Megrahi’s description.There was forensic evidence, too. A fingernail-sized fragment of a circuit board, recovered in Scottish woodland months after the crash, was identified as a remnant of the device that brought down Pan Am 103.FBI officer Thomas Thurman also identified it as part of an electronic timer made by MEBO, a Swiss firm which made circuit boards for domestic appliances and had supplied some to Libya. One of MEBO’S technicians named Ulrich Lumpert was willing to testify that he had made this particular board. On November 14, 1991 al-Megrahi and an ‘accomplice’ called Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah were formally accused at simultaneous press conferences in Edinburgh and Washington. Gaddafi was ordered to extradite them, but resisted, offering to try them in Libya.The stalemate was not resolved until almost ten years later when it was agreed the two Libyans should face justice in a Scottish court sitting at Kamp van Zeist, a disused American Air Force base in Utrecht, Holland.Al-Megrahi was found guilty. Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah was cleared, yet the stench of a fix remained. MEBO’s co-owner, Edwin Bollier, for example, revealed he had declined an FBI offer of several million dollars for a circuit board to be used in evidence and to testify that the fragment produced in court was part of one specifically supplied to Libya.In 2007, his technician Lumpert admitted he had lied. He also confessed to stealing part of a timing board from MEBO and handing it to an ‘official person investigating the Lockerbie case’.There were problems, too, with the technical evidence.FBI explosive ‘expert’ Thurman was later revealed to be a politics graduate with no relevant scientific training who had altered laboratory reports to favour the prosecution in 30 cases.Even the identifying witness, shopkeeper Gauci, was tainted. The court was not told he had initially picked out a photograph of a completely different terror suspect and only in the course of 18 further statements did his description of the clothes shopper change to fit al-Megrahi. Gauci’s financial reward from the CIA was not disclosed.The investigators glossed over the question of how the terrorists were supposed to prime their bomb in Malta and expect it to explode two flights later.The small number of people who had followed the trial, including relatives of victims such as Jim Swire and the Rev John Mosey, each of whom lost a daughter, and the official United Nations observer Professor Hans Kochler, considered the verdict a gross miscarriage of justice.On August 20, 2009, al-Megrahi, in the final stages of terminal prostate cancer, was released on compassionate grounds ahead of his second appeal against conviction.Shortly after he was flown back to Libya, Alistair Darling, then the Chancellor, and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond both denied the release had anything to do with a deal struck with the Libyan government over BP oil contracts.However, there is another reason why the release might have been politically expedient. Al-Megrahi’s new lawyers wanted to call hundreds of pages of evidence withheld from his original trial that would have linked the case to Iran and the PFLP-GC, rather than al-Megrahi and Libya – to the huge embarrassment of Westminster and Washington.The Labour Government was so concerned that Foreign Secretary David Miliband issued a public interest immunity certificate exempting the prosecution from disclosing any evidence it chose to hide.Most of the participants in the story went to the grave without the truth being told. Al-Megrahi died at home with his family on May 20, 2012. Palestinian terror leader Ahmed Jibril was blown up by a roadside bomb placed by an Al Qaeda-linked group on August 26, 2014. Bomb-maker Marwan Khreesat reportedly died in October 2016.Only the mysterious Abu Elias, claimed to be the person most likely to have placed the Samsonite suitcase on Flight 103, is believed to be still alive. He was named in the Scottish parliament in 2009 and is thought to be living in Washington DC under a witness protection programme and employed by the local education authority under the name of Basel Bushnaq.

Britain once again stands on the cusp of a new future as an outward-facing, global trading nation.‘And, just as millions of Britons celebrated their nation’s great achievements in 1951, we want to showcase what makes our country great today.’The announcement may spark criticism that Mrs May is trying to distract from mounting disunity over Brexit in her own party, and speculation over whether she will still be in the post in 2022 – the date of the next General Election.May arrives in Birmingham for Tory conference showdown: PM...PM demands end to Troubles \u0027witch hunt\u0027: Theresa May tells...Share this articleThere are also suggestions that the idea has been hastily dreamt up, with Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright reportedly only asking Cabinet colleagues for their views on the festival just a few days ago.But Mrs May hailed it as the chance ‘to mark this moment of national renewal with a once-in-a-generation celebration’.  It would also be an event that ‘strengthens our precious union and promotes the UK as the most creative and innovative nation in the world’.To be known simply as ‘The Festival’, it will build on major events already taking place that year, including the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and the 75th anniversary of the Edinburgh International Festival. It would also coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.A new delivery body will be set up to co-ordinate the event under a creative director, who will work alongside Mr Wright’s department.

When asked to rank the subjects most important to ‘me and my family’, the top concern was the cost of living, followed by the NHS.Brexit was only the third most important issue, despite it consuming most of the energies of the May administration.          Theresa May arriving at the Tory Party conference in Birmingham. The gathering is set to be dominated by Brexit When asked which party did most to ‘help ordinary people get on in life’, Labour held a lead of 24 percentage points.Lord Ashcroft concludes that Mrs May will struggle to win a commanding lead over Labour because many of the poorer voters who back her determination to push through with Brexit had been alienated by Conservatives’ public spending cuts – which Mr Corbyn has exploited by pledging to reverse.Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Lord Ashcroft says: ‘This is why Mrs May found it impossible to achieve a majority in last year’s snap Election.’He added: ‘It is also why, in the event of a parliamentary impasse over the Brexit deal, she would be unwise to expect a better outcome from a new Election than she got from the last one.’On Brexit, Lord Ashcroft – whose 10,000-plus sample size is more than four times larger than a typical opinion poll – found that voters appear to be losing confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to negotiate a good deal.When asked to rate their confidence out of 100, voters gave an average score of just 31 – down from 40 in May this year and 52 in March 2017.          Tory delegates were unnerved by Labour’s unusually slick and upbeat conference in Liverpool last week with Jeremy Corbyn Part of the reason is that the EU is widely perceived to hold the whip hand in the negotiations, with 53 per cent of voters regarding the EU as stronger. Just 13 per cent believe the UK is stronger.There was significant support for the idea that the best way for Mrs May to get the best deal was for her to ‘stand up to Brussels’.A total of 40 per cent think she should threaten to walk away without a deal, compared with 28 per cent who want her to seek more compromises.And despite growing concern within Government over the consequences of a no deal, only one third of voters believe it will lead to major disruption and shortages.Lord Ashcroft also found that most of those in his focus groups had little idea about the details of Mrs May’s Chequers plan, other than it had prompted Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis to resign.One member said: ‘You get the feeling it’s draft one, and draft two is going to follow.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Lord Ashcroft tells Theresa key issues win election","story":"    Prime Minister Theresa May is right to threaten to leave without a deal, rather than seek further compromise with an intransigent EU We know we voted to leave the EU by 52 per cent to 48 per cent, but we are also still precisely ided over austerity – whether the Government was right to try to balance the books in the way it did after 2010.The trouble is, these two powerful ides cut across each other: just under half of Leave voters backed austerity, while a third of pro-austerity voters wanted to remain in the EU. This, as much as anything, explains why British politics has felt so arduous for so long.Michael Gove says Theresa May is open to Boris Johnson\u0027s...\u0027I often think about my birth mother\u0027: Emotional Michael...Theresa May plans to evoke the 1951 \u0027Festival of Britain\u0027...Share this articleDavid Cameron assembled a winning coalition of voters around his long-term economic plan based on restoring order to the public finances.Mrs May tried to bring together all those who thought Brexit should mean Brexit. But too many who agreed with her about that could not bring themselves to support what they still thought of as the party of cuts and too many who had accepted austerity would not vote for what had become, in their eyes, the party of Brexit.This is why Mrs May found it impossible to achieve a majority at last year’s Election.It is also why, in the event of a parliamentary impasse over the Brexit deal, she would be unwise to expect a better outcome from a new Election than she got from the last one. In my poll, Leave voters who wanted a clean break with the EU and backed austerity, put their likelihood of voting Tory at the next Election twice as high as hard Brexiteers who opposed the cuts.          David Cameron assembled a winning coalition of voters around his long-term economic plan based on restoring order to the public finances Only 13 per cent of anti-austerity Leave voters who want a hard Brexit – the people the PM hoped to attract last June – think the Conservatives are on the side of people like them.That is not to say that Brexit doesn’t matter. My research finds confidence that the Government will achieve a good deal has fallen steadily over the past 18 months, especially among Leave voters. Many expect a messy compromise in which we will still be closely tied to the EU.Though few know what is in the Chequers plan (‘you get the feeling it’s draft one, and draft two is going to follow’, as one of our focus group participants observed sagely), many Leavers are alarmed by the idea of a common rulebook – meaning the UK agrees to follow EU rules and regulations. Voters who say they want a soft Brexit are, in practice, reluctant to compromise on any of the things they think Brexit should mean: independent law-making, our own free-trade deals, stopping free movement, and ending payments to the EU. Yet most voters feel that Brussels has the stronger hand in the negotiations.But Brexit is just one of the things the Government has to deal with, and in many voters’ eyes it isn’t even the most important. It comes a close second to the NHS when we ask what matters most, but falls to a distant third when we ask people about priorities for themselves and their families, with the cost of living at the top of the list.Labour is believed to have the best approach to both these issues by a comfortable margin.Labour has its own problems, of course. Nearly four in ten of the anti-austerity voters it relies on backed Leave in the referendum – and while many of them cheerfully voted Labour last year, they might not be impressed if the party carries on saying it is not ‘ruling out remain as an option’, as Sir Keir Starmer did last week.I found many Labour voters lamenting the lack of leadership that allowed the anti-Semitism row to rumble on for months, and disquiet at Jeremy Corbyn’s ‘shifty’ response to claims of connections with terror groups.           But the Tories would be foolish to rely on Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell to win them another term, even after the Marxist fantasies they flaunted in Liverpool last week.After all, they were on the ballot at the last Election, which nearly ended in disaster for the Tories. They must recognise that people are desperate to move on from Brexit – as desperate as Mrs May herself must surely be.If the issue must dominate the agenda at Cabinet, it can’t dominate the conference, or what the party has to say to the voters.The thing that most unites people who lean towards the Conservatives is not Brexit or any other area of policy – it is the belief that the party shares their values.This is the key. If the Tories can’t bring the pro-austerity band back together or unite Leavers under its banner, it must find a new way to show people it knows what it is doing and is on their side.Looking at the things that drove many non-Tories to want to leave the EU – concerns about housing, public services, economic opportunity and the quality of life – would be a good place to begin.Rebuilding the Conservative brand will be a tall order this week, but the work must start now.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Michael Gove holds tears describes parents adopted him","story":"    Michael Gove was adopted when he was four months old by a working-class Aberdonian family            Former running mates Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have both slimmed down lately.

I think it is surreal that there I am and I think my 13- or 14-year-old self would never have imagined that I would have had the opportunities that I’ve had. It does weigh on me that you’ve got to live up to the care and love that you’ve received.’After serving a brief penance on the backbenches following his doomed leadership bid two years ago, Mr Gove is once again a pivotal figure in the Government, turning his Environment department into a campaigning hub – most notably with his successful ban on polluting plastics.But he is also playing a central role in the great political drama of Brexit, with an under-pressure Downing Street grateful for his soothing ministrations as Theresa May fights to save her Chequers plan in the face of hostility from both the EU and Tory Brexiteers.Boris Johnson has led the rebellion, firing a ferocious salvo on the eve of Tory conference in a newspaper article which described Chequers as a ‘moral and intellectual humiliation’ and backed a free trade agreement similar to that signed with the EU by Canada. Mr Gove is playing a typically canny game behind the scenes – publicly supporting the PM, while privately trying to ‘wargame’ a cross-Cabinet strategy to avert a ‘no deal’ scenario, which he fears could cause more economic disruption than many fellow Brexiteers claim.Along with pro-Remain Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid, he is growing increasingly convinced that the Canada option should be on the table, rather than a stark choice between Chequers or no deal.Other so-called ‘Govoid’ acolytes include Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom.Mr Gove offers tacit endorsement for remarks made by Mr Hunt last week, when the Foreign Secretary was asked if the Canada model should be considered as an alternative to Chequers.           Along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr Gove is growing increasingly convinced that the Canada option should be on the tableTo the fury of some in No 10, Mr Hunt said that he was ‘not dismissing anything’.Asked if he agrees with Mr Hunt, Mr Gove says: ‘It’s in Jeremy’s nature always, and I am trying to learn from this myself, not to criticise but to concentrate on the positive. \u0027Jeremy is one of the most naturally considerate, thoughtful and polite people in politics. I’m sure he would have considered his comments carefully and they would therefore have merit and should be listened to.’Mr Gove also lavishes praise on Mr Johnson, sidestepping the critique of Chequers by claiming not to have read Friday’s 4,500-word article. ‘I’m a fan of Boris and I like and admire him. I respect his viewpoint and I’m looking forward to reading the article,’ he says. ‘I suspect there will be some things in it with which I will disagree.’He adds: ‘He’s done so much and I have huge regard for him.          Mr Gove also lavishes praise on Mr Johnson and says ‘I’m a fan of Boris and I like and admire him\u0027 ‘He is one of the most significant and attractive figures in British politics.’Does he think Mrs May feels betrayed by Boris? ‘The thing about the Prime Minister is that she’s an incredibly resilient and focused person and so I think she accepts Boris is someone with strong views.’Quizzed about whether he has changed his view that Mr Johnson was not fit to be Prime Minister, Mr Gove says: ‘I think if I were to try to rank any of my other colleagues that would only distract attention from concentrating on what we really need to do, which is to get that deal.’However, his friendship with David Cameron appears terminally ruptured: the former Prime Minister, encouraged by wife Samantha, refuses to forgive Gove for campaigning for Brexit.          Mr Gove\u0027s friendship with David Cameron (pictured) appears terminally ruptured as he refuses to forgive Gove for campaigning for Brexit- encouraged by wife Samantha (pictured) Although he laughs when told that Cameron has joked he has made such little progress with his No 10 memoirs that Gove is ‘still one of the good guys’, the split must be painful – particularly since Cameron has not spurned Mr Johnson in the same way.Some Gove friends argue that class – Cameron and Johnson are Old Etonians – has played a role in this apparent double standard.Gently evading the issue, Mr Gove says: ‘I won’t speculate about what other people think or feel. I think other people can run all sorts of theories. I haven’t seen David for a while but I wish him well.‘I think he was a great Prime Minister and I think that he’s a great guy and I wish him only the best for the future.’Invited to picture a kiss-and-make-up dinner party between all three men, he says: ‘I think if I was at a dinner party with them then I would definitely have to buy the wine and I would do my best to make sure it was a very nice bottle.’The threat from Jeremy Corbyn, after a successful party conference in Liverpool, is also exercising the minds of senior Conservatives as they arrive in Birmingham – and how they can match the success of his populist, soak-the-rich economics. ‘If Jeremy Corbyn got into power, it would be a disaster for this country,’ Mr Gove says.          The threat from Jeremy Corbyn, after a successful party conference in Liverpool (pictured) is also exercising the minds of senior Conservatives ‘The economic prospectus that they’ve laid out is terrifying and I think that we would see the country suffer as never before. It’s an historical fact that every time Labour has left office, unemployment has been higher than it was when they entered.‘There is no doubt that Corbyn’s proposals would lead to an investment freeze, to jobs going and it would hit the poorest in the pocket hardest.’He singles out housing and education policy as priorities for the Conservatives to combat the Corbyn threat.Mr Gove, who is married to the columnist Sarah Vine and lives in West London with their two children, is famed among his colleagues for an almost theatrical level of courtesy and charm, which some wonder might be a shield to conceal the ‘real’ Gove.  Asked if he deploys it as a ‘barrier’, he says: ‘It is a very good question. I do think that I have got powers of self-analysis and it’s partly how I was brought up – my mum always said you should treat other people as you would like to be treated yourself.’          Mr Gove is married to the columnist Sarah Vine (pictured) and lives in West London with their two childrenThe same colleagues wonder if his formative years helped to sharpen his ambition: researchers have found that prominent politicians are significantly more likely to have come from childhoods disrupted by orce, estrangement or bereavement.He becomes reflective: ‘My adoptive parents, my parents made a choice and therefore I do feel from time to time that I’ve got to prove to them that they didn’t make a mistake and so it does weigh on my mind that I’ve got to try to put something back. I’ve got to demonstrate to them that they were right to take a chance on me.’He also acknowledges the impact of watching his father struggle to support his family – including a period of school fees for the precocious Gove – when his fish-processing business was ailing.‘My experiences growing up, my dad’s business and what happened to it, the nature of my sister being adopted and being profoundly deaf as well, that must have an impact on me. I think – I could be wrong – that it’s given me a sense of the fragility of things. My sister overcoming her disability, my dad recovering from bad business news, it makes you realise that happiness rests on a fragile crust and therefore it is very, very important to recognise how important it is to do everything you can to help support people through difficult times, but also to recognise how fortunate you are, how fortunate I am in the circumstances I am currently in.‘I haven’t sought out my birth mother and that’s partly because I worried that it would seem to my parents, my adoptive parents, that I had something missing and I was looking to fit in a missing part and they have been such brilliant parents.’He says he has discussed his decision not to find his birth mother with his children.‘I do think about it. It’s a funny thing, when you go to the doctor and they ask you, is there a history of X in your family and I’ll say I’m adopted and so on.‘I sometimes think of my children and I can recognise traits in them, sometimes I can see Sarah’s traits and sometimes I can see mine, sometimes I can see Sarah’s parents’ traits in them, but there are aspects of the parents that show up in their make-up that obviously relate to my birth mother.’He said his son William, a talented footballer, was pleased because he ‘can decide whether to play for Scotland or England as a result of it’, adding: ‘It is an amazing thing that there is no sporting ability as far as I can see in myself and yet he has somehow got it from somewhere.’So does that ambition still extend to No 10? ‘I had a crack, it didn’t work out.‘We’ve got the right Prime Minister now,’ he insists."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/20/01/506DB7DD00000578-0-image-a-8_1537402763357.jpg","title":"One five children secret social media accounts hide parents","story":"    There\u0027s been rapid growth in ‘fake Insta’ accounts – a reference to photo-sharing site InstagramFormer Teacher of the Year, 42, \u0027posed as a 17-year-old boy...‘Sorry darling’: Female teacher, 51, who groomed a...Share this articleTwenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised ‘main’ account to show parents, while also having private ones.

Happily, there is a huge quantity of working-class literature and talent out there and I believe it is only growing. When I think of exceptional working-class novels from the last few years, I inevitably think of Kit de Waal’s My Name Is Leon and Paul McVeigh’s The Good Son, both skilfully written books about two very different boys’ challenges growing up in working-class environments.Scotland has an incredible wealth of working-class writers, thanks to a strong community and tradition of support from established authors. There’s a host of brilliant writers to discover, but my favourites include Janice Galloway, James Kelman, Jenni Fagan and Lisa O’Donnell. I wouldn’t think to play favourites here, choose any of these writers’ fine books and you’re in for a treat.I’m often trying to impress on the industry that there’s an appetite for working-class books and it helps if the book-buying public take a risk on new voices. Debut novels I’ve been impressed with this year include the magical North Yorkshire coming-of-age novel How Saints Die by Carmen Marcus, Glen James Brown’s hugely accomplished interlinked stories about a Middlesbrough housing estate, Ironopolis, and Home, Amanda Berriman’s heart-wrenching tale of a family on the edge.For even fresher talent, I unreservedly recommend the forthcoming anthology Common People.

Boring Phil needs to talk to the nation, not his party. It is time for the most senior one-nation Tory (Theresa May is a pretender to this crown) to be a bit more statesmanlike and think about people beyond the audience.That doesn’t look likely though. His announcement last week of an autumn budget (on 29 October), suggested he plans to stick to offering a “balanced approach” to debt “while supporting vital public services, and building a stronger, more prosperous economy”.He uses these phrases almost every time he emerges from the Treasury. And indications are that audiences at this week’s Tory conference can expect more of the same, with extra Brexit spice and a twist of global uncertainty.That means he will tell the crowd inside Birmingham’s conference centre that his balanced approach will be applied even more conservatively now it is clear the disastrous prospect of a no-deal Brexit could coincide with a trade tariff war.How, he will ask, can he spend more money when he may need to draw on every bit of our reserves in just six months? It would be irresponsible to spend now, when Britain and the world economy are entering an uncertain phase.That’s just a fraud. The government is pursuing anything but a balanced approach. Things are already falling apart and the next four years will be even rougher than the past eight as he puts deficit reduction ahead of protecting public services and supporting vulnerable families.As for building a stronger economy, Hammond has set aside some money for transport infrastructure, but precious little Treasury cash for anything new or innovative.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has produced a string of disturbing reports showing that a slowdown in GDP growth since 2016 – most of which can be attributed to the referendum vote – will leave workers facing an unprecedented second decade of weak earnings growth and more years of austerity.At the last budget, when the Office for Budget Responsibility said it had lost faith in Britain’s ability to generate strong productivity growth, and with it inflation-busting wage rises, the IFS warned that average earnings were on course to be £1,400 a year lower in 2021 than had been forecast in 2016. In addition, borrowing was likely to be £12bn higher in 2021 than previously predicted.If you thought a cold wind blew through public services between 2008 and 2018, prepare for a permanent winter for the next 10 years.Today the Observer reveals that the cost of lost growth, mediocre wage rises and lower tax receipts since the referendum vote is £26bn and counting, much worse than previously estimated.Hammond knows that the fabric of public services is fraying and people are not receiving even a basic level of support they deserve. Schools are the latest to shred their budgets to retain staff most other public service providers have already cut themselves to the bone.Hammond is an honourable, one-nation Tory who stood with May when she said that just-about-managing families deserved more support. He wants to help, say his Treasury colleagues. It’s just that the loss of economic activity already incurred and the losses to come have boxed him in and mean he must keep his financial powder dry. He would, they say, raise taxes on us all to fund better public services. He’d even tax the rich more than the poor, but his own party, Jacob Rees-Mogg in particular, won’t wear it.The Resolution Foundation calculates that on current projections, he could free up £77bn by 2022 to spend on welfare and services. It might disappoint the IMF, which has decided to repeat the same mistakes that it made after the financial crash by insisting on manic deficit-reduction-linked austerity, but on this subject it is discredited.Hammond, for the sake of our democracy, must argue the case for a more caring government, Brexit or no Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2774178631cb2138b11f61838ed85ea398fd7549/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a0b10316fb03a22ff793483a1b04803","title":"uk mulls audit sector reform after minister admits deficiencies","story":"Big four dominance under review after Carillion and BHS failures, says business secretaryThe government has called for a comprehensive review of Britain’s auditing industry in what could herald huge changes to a sector dominated by the firms known as the big four.Calls for reform have grown after the collapse of the construction giant Carillion and the former high street stalwart BHS revealed serious inadequacies in the auditing process.“The collapse of Carillion exposed deficiencies in an audit process, where the market is dominated by just four large firms,” Clark said, in an interview with the Financial Times.He added: “We know competition is one of the key drivers for maintaining and improving standards, so I have asked the Competition and Markets Authority to consider looking again at what can be done to improve the audit sector.”Thousands of jobs were lost following Carillion’s collapse in January, with a subsequent parliamentary report finding that Deloitte – which received £10m to be the outsourcing company’s internal auditor – had been either “unable or unwilling” to identify failings in financial controls, or “too readily ignored them”.Ernst \u0026amp Young was paid £10.8m for “six months of failed turnaround advice”. Elsewhere, PwC was fined £10m by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for signing off on the accounts of BHS, before its sale for £1. The retailer collapsed in 2016, prompting the loss of 11,000 jobs.Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, said poor business practices were “waved through by a cosy club of auditors, conflicted at every turn”.The FRC has previously called for an inquiry into whether the big four should be broken up, with their audit isions spun off. This year, Deloitte warned that such a measure could affect the UK’s standing as a global financial centre.Labour welcomed the announcement, but claimed the Conservatives were “playing catch-up”.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “The Tories are finally taking their lead from Labour on tackling the big four audit firms. Labour commissioned an independent review of the UK’s corporate auditing and accounting regime earlier in the year, and now the business secretary is trying to play catch up.“But the government cannot use this review to sweep issues under the carpet. Failures of auditing and accounting on the Tories’ watch led to the collapse of Carillion.“The next Labour government will change regulations to make sure scandals like Carillion never happen again.” The review will be led by Andrew Tyrie, the head of the Competition and Markets Authority.“The CMA has been considering for some time how best to contribute to the work being carried out to improve audit,” he said. A CMA spokesperson added: “We’re actively considering what next steps are needed.”Ernst and Young said: “We are aware of the comments made by Greg Clark and recognise the importance of the debate to ensure a strong profession. Our absolute priority is to serve and protect the public interest and bring confidence to the capital markets, and we welcome measures that would encourage new entrants into the audit market.”Deloitte said: “We are supportive of measures to reform the audit market that respond to concerns raised on choice and perceived conflicts. At the same time we are focused on continuing to improve audit quality and any measures for reform must support the delivery of high quality audits.  “We believe that concerns raised go to a deeper question as to the purpose of audit and its value to stakeholders. To address this a wider discussion is needed to consider what the role of audit can and should be in the future, especially as large companies continue to grow in scale, become increasingly technology driven and complex, and global in their outlook and requirements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39dc9e6d73476e5eeca8ee23ffd65127dea30a55/0_132_4991_2996/master/4991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7674464f25b60a1ea5a67c2827fb76c","title":"peaky blunders at the tory party conference cartoon","story":"Chris Riddell imagines a right royal Brexit bunfight in Birmingham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b499d7047db93c5c79418f5432adab261a213ef/1533_1365_3101_1860/master/3101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd34139286f36087e964e4fec8e2445","title":"claire foy my anxiety was a tool to survive","story":"She has just won an Emmy for her role in The Crown and now takes the lead in two Oscar-tipped films. So why doesn’t the British actor believe her own hype?Claire Foy has the heebie-jeebies. The actor, who until last year played a young Elizabeth II in the Netflix drama The Crown, has spent the last few hours being photographed in a studio in London. It’s a nondescript building that sits between a janitorial supply store and a tinned tomato factory, but the place carries very distinct memories. “It’s where I did my main audition for The Crown,” Foy says, shuddering. “I was five months pregnant. They put me in a wig and – oh God – a wedding dress. I had really bad carpal tunnel, and a swollen nose, and my lips were just massive. I had to flirt with Winston Churchill. I remember thinking, ‘I’m not sure this is gonna go my way...’”We flee the weird associations to a pub not far away, where Foy, who’s been off caffeine for a couple of months, makes do with a long, pained sniff of my coffee and orders a soda water. She landed the main part in The Crown in 2014, and went on to appear in its first two series, winning a Golden Globe last year, and an Emmy this year. By arrangement, Foy and all her co-stars have surrendered their roles (Olivia Colman and others are currently on set as the Windsors, a little older) and this has freed up Foy to turn to movies. She has a couple of huge ones due: a moody, Oscar-y biopic about Neil Armstrong, First Man, in which Foy plays opposite Ryan Gosling as the spaceman’s wife and then a noisier blockbuster, with Foy shorn and dragon-tattooed as Lisbeth Salander in The Girl In The Spider’s Web. She shot both films consecutively, Christmas through to spring, and hasn’t taken another job since, in order to spend the summer with her daughter.We settle at a garden table. Foy wears a denim jumpsuit, collar wide on the throat that was so famously menaced when she played Anne Boleyn in the BBC’s Wolf Hall. The dark hair is short, upthrust, much toyed with – a grown-out version of Salander’s punky undercut, which suits her but which the actor isn’t so enamoured of: “I’ve just got to patiently wait it out.” She has distinctive freckles on her face and arms that must have been determinedly suppressed by the makeup teams on The Crown and Wolf Hall, and a ridiculous accent that will veer from East Midlander to north Londoner to senior Windsor in the space of a phrase. And she’s funny: Matt Smith, her Crown co-star, told a story on Desert Island Discs about how the two of them would ramp up their royal tics and posh-isms until one or the other couldn’t act for laughing.The day we meet is the last of the summer holidays, so Foy has the slightly wild alertness of someone who has spent six weeks distracting and entertaining a child. Once she establishes that we both have young daughters, she poses one of the great questions of modern parenting: “Who would you be, Elsa or Anna?” In both our homes there has been a lot of Disney’s Frozen, a lot of introspection brought on by the ruthless 24-hour scrutiny of four-year-olds. In the garden, Foy marvels at it – how parenthood holds up a mirror, and an unflattering one. “It makes you realise, looking after a child, the holes you have in yourself.” And why not, she goes on. “You become someone’s parent – and suddenly you’re supposed to be capable? Have all the answers? Know what to do every day?” That’s never really been her way.Foy grew up in Buckinghamshire, the youngest of three, her mother in pharmaceuticals and her father in sales. They separated when she was eight and Foy, speaking delicately so as not to hurt their feelings, says the following years were “slightly chaotic”. Her response was to try to “make everybody happy. Never be angry. Be really sweet and well-behaved. I didn’t want to upset people”.She had a couple of serious illnesses in her teens – a benign tumour behind one eye, juvenile arthritis that put her on crutches for a while. “As a teenager you’re supposed to distance yourself from your parents, aren’t you, and test the boundaries? See who you are as a person by saying, ‘Fuck you!’ But I didn’t want to upset or hurt them, in the endeavour of making life easy and calm.” It all helped cook up a whopping case of anxiety, one that grew worse as she got older. Foy pulls a funny face to demonstrate what she was like: eager-to-please eyes, a slightly demonic grin. She tells a few jokey, belittling anecdotes about this difficult period (“My sister went to Leeds University to do broadcast journalism, and when it came to my turn, I applied to Leeds to do broadcast journalism”) but the anxiety was and is a serious issue in her life. Foy has never really spoken in depth about it now, everything comes out.“When you have anxiety, you have anxiety about – I don’t know – crossing the road,” she says. “The thing about it is, it’s not related to anything that would seem logical. It’s purely about that feeling in the pit of your stomach, and the feeling that you can’t, because you’re ‘this’ or you’re ‘that’. It’s my mind working at a thousand beats a second, and running away with a thought.”What thoughts? Foy answers briskly, brushing her hand in the air: “It’s lots of thoughts about how shit I am.”Looking back, she’s come to think it started as a form of self-protection. “It was a tool to survive, definitely. To try to hold on to everything. To try to feel safe.” She describes an endless series of anticipations and second-guesses. If this happens, what then? And what then? And what then? “If I knew a day was going to be ruined by anxiety, that was good in a way, because it meant I knew what was going to happen.”I ask whether a career in acting has made this worse or better. “Oh, God.” She laughs. “It definitely magnified when I started doing this. Exploded. Yeah.”She didn’t study journalism at Leeds (they said no). Instead she went to Liverpool John Moores University, to do drama and film studies, before enrolling for a postgraduate year at the Oxford School of Drama. “I started to learn that the most important thing to do as an actor was not to try to pre-empt everything – to stay in the moment.” After graduation she came out of the blocks fast, landing a small part in a play at the National Theatre, and then the title role in a big mainstream Dickens adaptation, Little Dorrit, on the BBC in 2008.It was then that audiences first got a glimpse of Foy’s peculiar skill – a near-genius for the silent response to others. So often her dilating eyes, the flinching muscles in her jaw and neck, do more thorough emotional work than the dialogue going on around her. It’s become Foy’s thing, “a very powerful ability to do very little and speak volumes”, as The Crown’s director Stephen Daldry put it. In First Man, Foy appears in a devastating early sequence about the terminal illness of a child. Filmed closer and closer, Foy says hardly 10 words, and shows us a whole universe of grief via a few smoked cigarettes. The actor credits guidance she got at the start, from Little Dorrit’s director Dearbhla Walsh. “Dearbhla told me: ‘Everyone around you will be swinging off the chandeliers – that’s what Dickens requires. But you’re in the centre of it. Don’t do anything. Don’t try to act. No chandeliers.’”For the next six or seven years Foy had no public profile, and although she was never long out of work (a Nicolas Cage action movie, a Peter Kosminsky drama, Shakespeare and Caryl Churchill on the London stage), there were many near-misses for big parts. This year the casting director Nina Gold, who has known Foy for a decade, told the  that she was put in audition after audition, “and she was always really good, but she was never quite exactly, totally right. Or somebody else was a bit more right. She was always the second choice.” Foy says she was never too gutted – the opposite. “I didn’t mind missing out, because it seemed safer. I’d think: ‘Give that job to that person. Then I don’t have to think about my life changing in any massive way.’”In 2014, after championing Foy for years, Gold put her up for the Anne Boleyn gig. Foy had worked with Wolf Hall’s director, Kosminsky, before but she still needed to convince him. She was on a shoot in Puerto Rico at the time, playing a pirate’s moll in a short-lived series for US television called Crossbones. “Hair extensions. Fake tan. Those were the days.” Off set, she filmed herself in character as Henry VIII’s fierce, prickly, doomed young bride. She could hardly convince herself at first.“I’d read Hilary Mantel’s novel. And I just thought: ‘I’m not her. Not in any way, shape or form.’ Anne was so intelligent, so alluring, so able to be mysterious and have people be fascinated with her. Anne knew she was special. She spoke five languages. I just didn’t see it.”But Kosminsky and Gold did, and Foy’s performance made the show – her Anne coming at the other Tudors sideways, sardonic and hungry, her ambition outpacing them all until the young queen is herself outpaced and sentenced to death. Anne’s arrival at her execution, played by Foy with a sort of terse disbelief, even anger, made for unforgettable drama. Kosminsky has called that scene the proudest in his long career. Foy says: “I was weirdly angry at the time, I remember. My hormones were going absolutely crazy. I was definitely loosening my corset that day.”It was only after Wolf Hall had wrapped that she figured out she had been pregnant throughout. At the time, she was married to the actor Stephen Campbell Moore. The pair announced their separation in the spring, and Foy has said she would rather not speak about it today. Instead she talks about her memories of that pregnancy, which “upped things”, she recalls. “I felt like the game was on in life. I had to get my shit together.” Gold felt she’d be right for The Crown, immediately after Wolf Hall, so Foy waddled along to the audition. “I was reticent – I’ve always been reticent about bigness. And I was scared, I didn’t know how I’d be after coming out the other end of having a child. You just don’t know – something could happen, I could get postnatal depression, I could, I don’t know, develop a limp? So many variables! But I said yes to it. I knew it would be financially stable. We needed to buy a house.”By now, she was seeing a therapist about her anxiety. “It got to a point where everyone I knew said go. I’m glad I did.” Sitting in the pub garden, I attempt an amateur read of the weird psychological situation she found herself in. So the anxiety, I say: that’s always told you to think about every possible consequence of everything.While the acting insists the opposite – don’t think ahead, react.“Yeah,” she says, “exactly, it’s very confusing. You’ve solved the puzzle. I took me 34 years to get to this point.”By the time The Crown began to shoot, pregnancy and a challenging labour had forced her to be pragmatic. “As soon as I had the baby, I didn’t have too much time to think, to second-guess myself. I didn’t put myself through the wringer as much.”She downplays the work she did over two brilliant series as “a lot of sitting”. And it’s true that other cast members had the better lines, providing much of the show’s chandelier-swinging energy, Matt Smith as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret, especially. Foy’s Elizabeth was stiller, more watchful, half-submerged. But the show worked only because of her she was its landscape and its weather. When she was called on stage to collect the Emmy this month, Foy’s understatement was fitting. “Bloody hell,” she said, dedicating it to Matt Smith and to the new actors who’d assumed their roles.The new Armstrong movie has been directed by La La Land Oscar-winner Damien Chazelle, and will inevitably be a part of the coming awards shuffle. There’s a moment in the film when Foy’s character, Janet Armstrong, abruptly becomes world famous. Her husband has just landed on the moon. There are reporters on her lawn, wanting a quote. The way Foy plays it, a mask of simulated enthusiasm comes over Janet, who is now a public figure required to improvise public quips. If there have been parallels in Foy’s life – “Vague things I’ve had where I’ve felt slightly intruded on” – she says she’s learned how to deal with them on the fly, usually by failing in the first instance.“I never thought I’d be in something as successful as The Crown,” she says. “And when you realise what success brings, and what people think about success... We laud success so much, and think that if you’re successful you’re special. When no, ultimately. Maybe it changes some people. But what I found really disconcerting was that it hadn’t changed me at all. Ultimately, all the same old crap is going on.”Foy receives a text reminding her that today is school uniform pickup day. One more day of the summer holidays to go. One more screening of Frozen, tops. I think again about what she said about the two cartoon princesses – how Foy would prefer to be the less anxious Anna, while her daughter, along with just about every four-year-old girl including my own, aches to be Elsa, who is the cursed, more troubled sister. “Why would you want to be Elsa?” Foy wondered. “Elsa’s deeply miserable. She’s got a power she doesn’t know how to deal with. Elsa doesn’t want to be Elsa.”Before she leaves, I ask her how the anxiety is today. “It’s plateaued,” she says. “All your shit – and everybody has shit – it doesn’t go away. It’s still there, but I guess I don’t believe it so much any more. I used to think that this was my lot in life, to be anxious. And that I would struggle and struggle and struggle with it, and that it would make me quite miserable, and that I’d always be restricted.“But now I’m able to disassociate myself from it more. I know that it’s just something I have – and that I can take care of myself.”• First Man is released in the UK on 12 October The Girl In The Spider’s Web is out on 21 November.Commenting on this piece?

He studied maths and theoretical physics at University College, Dublin. His latest book is Secret Science: The Amazing World Beyond Your Eyes.Who do you have in mind when you’re writing a science book for children?The dreadful problem with children is that there is no standard child. My book clearly isn’t written with any one child in mind. The easy answer is it’s written for the curious and the curious covers most eight- to 12-year-olds. I hate standups who write with a particular person in mind and get very angry when the wrong kind of people attend their shows. So if this book is adopted by 73-year-old men I just have to offer that up to the universe and say: “Well, there you go.”You obviously need to make it seem easy for the reader. Is that difficult to do?The perennial problem with any science stuff is where you pitch it. It’s impossible to write anything to do with science without undershooting some people and overshooting others. That’s always the juggling act. Weirdly I have this nagging feeling that this book is one year younger than the one we did last year, which this is the follow-up to. So maybe that was 9-13 and this is 8-12, if that actually means anything. It is ironically not an exact science.We tend as a society to be intimidated by science, but do you find that children are more open? If so, what goes wrong afterwards?I think by choosing to write for this particular age group, as opposed to even two years later, I’m going easy on myself and choosing the last age where you can talk about things like this before it seems like a subject. It’s sort of unavoidable because education has to teach the fundamentals, so at 13 to 14, it splits into “Oh no, we’ve got science” and people who get into it. I know from talking to others in the science world about the age when they read a science book and really got it, and it’s about 14. Unfortunately, that’s the age when a lot of other people move away. I’m keeping out of that battlefield and staying with the age of pure curiosity.You studied maths and theoretical physics at university. Did you feel in any way cut off from the humanities and the activities and social life connected to them?Actually the maths department was in the arts block. I don’t think anyone at college thought I cut myself off from the rest of college life. If anything, the complaint in the department was, it would have been nice to have a little bit more of you in the department. I very much fell into university debating and all that stuff. I could have done with a bit more isolation.What do comedy and science share?This only applies retrospectively, by the way, but when you’ve written a routine you can look back and say there are certain overlaps because a well-argued routine follows a particular logical structure that you use in maths all the time. You do a lot of reductio ad absurdum where you take an initial ridiculous premise and follow it to its illogical conclusion. Comics naturally do that. There’s a lot of comparing things to a lot of things, which is what you do in science when comparing phenomena. But for comic effect it’s a little bit more liberating.Do you feel a social pressure to be funny when you’re not working?There are comics who make an art form of being surly and uncommunicative and distant, and we envy them hugely. If you’ve ever had the good luck to see Dylan Moran turn down a selfie, apparently it’s a beautiful thing. Those of us who work at the more bonhomie end of the industry are obliged to have some of that at least. It’s not too heavy a burden to carry that people associate you with a happy thing. There are worse things to be known for.Which comedians were influential in your early years?Eddie Izzard, enormously. Dress to Kill was on rapid repeat on the video. And Steve Martin Live.What are the differences between Irish and British comedy?Traditionally we’ve been like a factory line of storytellers. That’s been our way to do it. There’s a method of long-form chat. The real contrast is with American standups who’ll do a finely wrought eight words about a situation. Whereas Irish comedians will go, that seems like a desperate waste of a situation. We didn’t have sketch groups or surreality. There’s more colours in the palette of British comedy.What books are on your bedside table?I’m in a hotel so it’s Condé Nast Traveller. Actually what is on the table are Adam Rutherford’s The Book of Humans, and Hannah Fry’s Hello World. I get sent every public science book. There’s always a stack of those around.Which genres do you avoid reading?For no good reason I avoid crime. I enjoy it on film and television, and I enjoy the plottedness of crime, but I don’t know what it is – the luridness of the covers? Is it a guilty pleasure for which the guilt is too great? It’s nothing more than snobbishness. I don’t think I’m better than that genre and I recognise that there are great writers within it, but for some reason I never go to it.Which classic novel have you always meant to read but never got round to?Most of them. There’s a massive hole for me with the 19th century. I only feel guilty about Dickens. I sat down with an eight-year-old to read Oliver Twist properly with her and I had to skip past the constant referrals to “the Jew” and also “Master Bates”. There’s a character that’s called that. I thought, really? You’re doing that to me now, Dickens?Which book would you give to a young person?How do you narrow that down? For the very young, Dr Seuss. That was very rare in Ireland when I was a kid. I made sure my own kids read it. For older kids, I don’t know.

The comedian on talent shows, trolls and his right to offendMy first ever gig was at a Pontins holiday camp when I was nine. It had a talent competition and I decided to enter as a standup, with a book of jokes from which I took all of my material. A lot of the jokes seemed to have no problem playing with the stereotype of Irish people being stupid. They were incredibly racist, but the bigger crime here, comedy-wise, was that my set was entirely built on stolen material.There was a joke about a man buying a Rolls-Royce who is a bit short of cash. He goes out into the street to see if someone can lend him 10p to make up the price. He bumps into an Irish man – we know he’s Irish, because his name is Paddy. Paddy says, “Here’s 20p. Buy me one as well.”The point of that joke is that Paddy is incredibly stupid, because he’s assumed that Rolls-Royces cost 10p. I’d never even met an Irish person, but I had the clear impression that they were all thick – and the Pontins crowd seemed to agree: the joke went down a storm.That was one of the many hugely racist jokes I told as part of my set that night at Pontins, Camber Sands, which I also delivered completely in a Sri Lankan accent – a very early recognition of the fact that my ethnic minority roots could be exploited for comedic value.Years later, when I was working as a trolley wally in a supermarket, I tackled the boredom by talking to the customers in as many different accents as I could manage. I started with one that I didn’t think would alert any suspicion – generic Asian – then moved on to Irish, Welsh, Australian and American. I am pretty sure I even smashed out a Chinese voice. I discovered it takes a very ballsy person to say, “I’m sorry, but I don’t think that’s how you really speak”, particularly to an Asian-looking, English-speaking guy with a lazy eye.Anyway, I won the Pontins competition. There were only two other contestants, and one was a girl playing a kazoo. She was shit, but at least she was performing her own material. I can’t remember what the other guy did. I didn’t care, because this fat Asian kid reading out loud in a fake accent blew them both out of the water.Twenty two years later, I finally decided to capitalise on that Pontins buzz. I was 31 and a teacher at the time, and I think I was actually aspiring to be a frustrated artist of some kind, in the way all teachers are. I Googled “comedy night” and found the Comedy Cafe in Shoreditch, London. It had a new-act session on a Wednesday, and you could phone up for a spot. I called and was told by a very nice lady that you were allowed to do the show only if you had done 20 or more gigs before. I lied and was booked for that week.When I arrived at the venue, I became immediately aware that I had made a mistake. The other comics on the bill hadn’t lied. They all knew each other, too, and were chatting excitedly about the evening ahead. I looked over the jokes I’d written on the train on the way to the gig. There is a magical, unexplainable phenomenon that still occurs to this day where, however funny you think the material you’ve written is, as soon as you turn up to a gig to try it out, it becomes almost incoherent.Gradually the club started to fill. The people looked terrifying – comedy connoisseurs who were going to hate everything I was doing. I started my set using my Sri Lankan accent. My plan was to reveal partway through that I don’t actually have a Sri Lankan accent. I imagined this would lead to the audience collapsing in fits of laughter, before I was carried out on their shoulders.What actually happened was that I did my big reveal and it got absolutely nothing. Then I remembered I’d nicked the idea off Omid Djalili. This was a lot of information to process, and I quickly descended into a panicked garble. I overran badly. I went on for such a long time that the guy running the night flicked the stage lights on and off, to signal to me that I’d outstayed my welcome. I didn’t understand at the time why the lights had flickered, and proceeded to deliver some witty riffs about the electricity failing.This was delivered to more silence. I then said my thank yous and left the stage to the sort of rapturous applause that you might expect if you started juggling at a funeral. People were just grateful I’d finished. I soon realised I’d got myself blacklisted at the Comedy Cafe for quite some time. On the plus side, I’d got some stage time under my belt and a possible introduction to Djalili if he wanted to have a go at me for ripping off his material.I don’t believe in make-or-break moments in your life. If you screw something up, it can knock you down, but that only means you’ll be better when you get back to where you were before. I also think luck has a huge part to play. You can be good at comedy, which means you’ll be given spots, but beyond that it is luck that pushes you to the next level. There are loads of brilliant comedians who haven’t had the breaks, and plenty of average comedians who have. I don’t think I’m the best comedian they could have got for anything I’ve done. And if I ever forget that, I can just look at Twitter, where I’ll quickly find someone saying, “Can somebody explain to me why somebody as unfunny as @RomeshRanga keeps managing to get on TV?”The one thing that all ethnic minority comedians seem to have to contend with is people telling them they talk about race too much. This happens if they mention it at all. There are certain people who, when they see a female or an ethnic minority comic, are basically waiting for them to mention something that they can accuse them of talking about all the time. For women, it’s periods and relationships for ethnic minority comics, it’s race. I’ve talked about this with the comic Rob Beckett, who said he joked about his teeth and being working class a lot, yet he’d never been accused of talking about either too much. If a woman wants to go on about periods or I want to talk exclusively about race, that should not be an issue. We should be letting market forces decide. If audiences stop laughing, that’s your clue – but if not, then it’s nobody’s right to pick you up on it. They can always go elsewhere.One night, we were filming Mock The Week, on which I’ve appeared a few times, when Hugh Dennis made an Isis joke. I said it would have gone better if I’d laughed, too, so that people felt reassured. It became a running joke throughout the recording that every time somebody told a gag that had any connection with race, I would laugh loudly and everyone would feel better.The night that show went out I got absolutely slaughtered on Twitter: “@RomeshRanga talking about race again. Quelle surprise” “@RomeshRanga waited a whole two minutes before talking about his race”. I found it unfair. People seem to want a moratorium on anybody discussing anything that doesn’t directly affect them, which means I’m being dictated to by people who have no direct experience of the subject I’m discussing.If you can make all of my life experiences the same as a white guy’s, and you can stop me experiencing racism, which I do all the time, then I’ll stop talking about race. And if you have ever tweeted me or spoken to me suggesting I talk about it too much, that’s a pretty racially intolerant position to adopt.To give you an example, I recently received this beautifully written message on Facebook: “I seen ur program about Albania, it was very intentional to make albania look bad,a u paki or smelly indian!!! I seen many ptograms about your race,about Asian gangs raping underage girls,maby you one of them!!!” If I’m receiving messages like that, surely I’m allowed to do a joke or two with a head wobble, mate.On another Mock The Week, I observed that old people should be allowed to be racist because they have enough going on. I thought nothing of it. The day after the show went out, I got a message saying something along the lines of, “Saw what you said about old people on Mock The Week. My grandparents didn’t fight in the war so that Pakis like you could express your views. If I ever found out where you lived I would end your worthless life.” I don’t recall ever claiming that his grandparents fought in the war so I could do Mock The Week, but I could confidently argue that they didn’t fight in the war so losers could type abuse at people from the comfort of their bedrooms.I reported it to the police, not because I thought it was a credible threat, but because people shouldn’t be able to spout off like that without repercussions. Also, the guy had posted it to my website, which requires you to put in your email address, so it wasn’t as anonymous as he’d perhaps assumed.The police took it seriously and got a full statement from me, then said they’d find this person and take action. They eventually located the guy’s house and spoke to him. He was so scared that the police told me it was probably overkill to press charges, and asked if I would be satisfied with a letter of apology. I said that would be fine if anything, it would be nice to get a letter.A couple of days later, I received a letter that painted a picture of a very different man from the one who’d sent a death threat to someone he’d never met. The letter said this person had been drinking wine while watching second world war documentaries, and was getting very worked up about history. He’d switched to BBC2, found me talking about old people and become enraged. He sent me an angry message. It all seemed a bit sad. But I still think he’s not a great guy. Nobody goes, “Isn’t it a nightmare when you have a touch too much chablis, then issue a death threat to a Paki?”I’ve come to think of these social media trolls as cowardly hecklers, but I get my fair share of the real kind, too. One of the most effective I’ve faced came at a gig about a week after my dad died in 2011. (That sounds insane, but I really thought it would be good for me to get straight back into things plus at that point, I really needed the money.) This was at Up The Creek, a great comedy club in Greenwich, London, and I love playing there – but the audiences can be feisty, to say the least. I started my set, feeling proud of myself for getting up onstage and doing 20 minutes of standup, like a brave little soldier, when a bloke in the front row decided to give me a racist heckle.It was so effective that I’m actually slightly nervous to ulge it here. What the bloke did was deliver a “bud bud ding ding”. There was a lot to admire in the way he did it. First, he said, “Bud bud ding ding” – that’s proper old-school racism and I respect that. Second, he said it loud enough only for me and his mates to hear, which meant that if I addressed it, I’d be drawing it to the attention of people who weren’t aware it had happened. Third, and possibly the most impressive of this heckle’s attributes, he repeated it every minute or so during my set. I performed the whole thing without acknowledging I was having “bud bud ding ding” repeated at me from the front row. If that bloke reads this, which is unlikely: well played. You’re a prick.Some comedy clubs are really hot on making sure hecklers get dealt with. Komedia in Brighton is particularly good at it, but on one occasion it did backfire. I was doing a set about the difficulties of taking your children on holiday when one of the crowd shouted, “Just sack off the little ragamuffins!”I was surprised to hear such an old-fashioned word, so I said, “Sorry, mate, did you just use the word ‘ragamuffin’?” The Brighton in the crowd came out then, as somebody else said: “You cannot say that to him. That’s racist!”I have no idea how it’s racist. This person just heard “ragamuffin”, made an association with Jamaican patois and took that to mean the guy was being racist, which I think in itself might be quite racist. Suddenly the bouncers came up and grabbed the guy to throw him out.I started protesting, but they put their hands up to say, “We’ve got this, don’t worry.” Next thing I knew, he was being frogmarched out.I finished my set, then ran outside to find him and get him back into the club, but he had gone. I felt terrible. If by any chance he’s reading this now, I’d like him to know that I’m sorry.But, really, you shouldn’t be so racist, mate.• Adapted from Straight Outta Crawley: Memoirs Of A Distinctly Average Human Being, by Romesh Ranganathan, published by Transworld on 4 October at £20.

That is the question for the house of Schiaparelli. The Paris couture house founded by Elsa Schiaparelli almost a century ago has launched its first collection of ready-to-wear clothes and handbags. For a label that has always celebrated the fantastical rather than the wearable, it is a concept almost as far fetched as Elsa Schiaparelli’s famous hat in the shape of an upturned shoe.Yet despite its long history of eccentricity, there is something very modern about this fashion house. The aesthetic is emoji-like, all lobsters, hearts and eyes. Schiaparelli designed the first jumpsuit, in 1930, and was the first designer to set a catwalk show to music. It was Schiaparelli and her friend Salvador Dalí who invented the art-fashion collaboration, as currently espoused at Calvin Klein and Raf Simons with US artist Sterling Ruby. (Legend has it that Dali wanted the lobster-embroidered evening gown he and Schiaparelli created to be displayed in the salon with a dressing of real mayonnaise, but he was overruled.)“We wanted to revisit this idea of collaboration, which is such a part of Schiaparelli history” said Bertrand Guyon, creative director for the past three years, speaking at the house’s salon in Place Vendôme.For the ready-to-wear collection, he took as a starting point Schiaparelli’s friendship with Man Ray and created clothes based on iconic artworks, in partnership with the Man Ray Foundation. Glass Tears, the artist’s famous close up of a pair of eyes, appears on a white T-shirt studded with Perspex teardrops, while the floating red lips from Observatory Time: The Lovers appear on a collaged, silk-screen shift dress.One of Elsa’s quirks was a superstitious devotion to the letter S. Shocking pink, her signature colour, inspired her perfume, Shocking. The first Schiaparelli handbag, designed by Guyon with a keyhole design on the clasp, is called Secret. It will retail at the fantastical price of £5,000.The surreal side of Paris fashion week was also on display yesterday at a pop-up shop in a warehouse on the left bank of the Seine, selling €100 rugs from Virgil Abloh’s soon-to-be released collection for Ikea. Half an hour before the opening time, a 500-strong queue of Abloh’s young fans stretched along the quai, excited by the prospect of buying one of his designs without the price tags that come with his Louis Vuitton menswear. For Abloh, the project keeps communication channels open with a broader audience than can afford luxury fashion or designer furniture. “No one owns anything any more, but if you have knowledge of a certain chair, then it is part of your dinner conversation. That is the millennials’ train of thought,” he said recently.By the time models began zooming past the audience on skateboards in a garage in the Marais, it was clear that this was not a day for ordinary catwalk shows. Andreas Kronthaler, Vivienne Westwood’s husband and a designer in his own right, took Jessica Fulford-Dobson’s portraits of female skateboarders in Kabul as a starting point for a collection that saw men and women in colourful loose robes. Some women – and a few men – skated in heeled mule sandals, although those in vertiginous platform boots stayed on foot. Westwood, who watched from the front row in a horse-print dress from the collection and an orange cardigan tied around her waist, joined her husband on the catwalk for his final bow, where he presented her with a bouquet of flowers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ed613a2ee1faeac440833adae272d0926181ad/1259_862_1649_990/master/1649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da88c9b60055c5a0f5e7fb5befd787f0","title":"harvey weinstein three former employees on working for him","story":"It’s a year since allegations about the producer sparked the #MeToo movement. Has workplace culture changed? Three ex-employees look back I’d had other jobs in the industry before and felt this one, in Harvey Weinstein’s London office, was a step up. The business was very successful at this point. There was a fairly high turnover of staff I worked there for just under a year.Harvey loves Europe, and he came to London all the time. He was here 10 days or two weeks in every month. We used to joke, “Thank God Concorde doesn’t exist any more” because at least we had a bit of notice. But he never set foot in the office, ever – business was entirely run from hotels. The office was a dump in Soho, so it didn’t seem unusual.There were two interviews for the job. I got a full briefing in the first interview about him being a bully, from the people who worked with him. I remember giving that same chat myself when I was interviewing later: this is the reality. I think it is a bit alluring – you’re thinking, “I can handle that.”Before my second interview with him, which was at a hotel, I did get warned about him going in to the bathroom and masturbating. But that person was very gossipy and I didn’t think it was realistic – it sounded so out there. I just didn’t believe it, which feels a bit ridiculous now. They made a bit of a joke about him being a perv: “Keep your coat on.”Now I think: didn’t that seem strange, and didn’t that seem wrong? But people were talking affectionately, if eye-rollingly, about him. I didn’t think I could expect better: if everyone else was OK with it, who was I to make a fuss?The conversation with Harvey was very brief, because the person in the London office had already decided they wanted me. He said something I heard him say to a lot of people: “I have a very good instinct. I can always tell when I’m going to get on well with someone.”I was told during my training that you must never lie to Harvey, or even fudge something – he would know. He has x-ray vision, and once he gets the bit between his teeth, he won’t let it go. But he also forgot things people had said only moments before, or went back on some big declaration he had just made, occasionally to his advantage.There were two parts to the job. The real work had very little to do with him: there were a lot of projects, attending festivals, trying to meet film-makers and writers. And there was the other part, which was his visits and dealing with him.It felt like everyone was his assistant. The philosophy was that the company runs best when Harvey is happy, so you have to make sure things run smoothly. Meetings were made and cancelled or moved or ran late, at the drop of a hat, and he’d be furious with us even though he had caused it. Weekends weren’t relevant, evenings were not relevant, breakfast meetings were scheduled for 7am after being up till 2am.My days were rarely the same, the only constant being that they were chaotic and adrenalised. You would end up being proud of the strangest things, like getting through the day without being screamed at, or without him publicly abusing someone else – a waiter, a colleague, a director, a driver. It was a horrible feeling to be screamed at or “fired” (he threatened this multiple times a day). But it was far worse to see him abuse someone else. Fighting back didn’t work with him, really, but you could intervene on someone else’s behalf and draw his fire. It was like tending to a giant, belligerent, disgusting baby. His moods dictated so much that you constantly thought about whether he was tired, hungry, thirsty, cold.I got told early on that he had girlfriends. Sometimes he would want them invited to things, or to send a car. Some were actresses, some I don’t know what they did. He was part of a rich-person’s circuit and a few of the women were connected to that. We’d never know when a girlfriend was going to turn up, or when we’d have to lie to his wife. But he would be happier afterwards. Now I worry those interactions were not necessarily what I took them to be.Part of the reason there is a culture of silence, which is not unique to Harvey Weinstein, is that in this industry you can be made to feel a bit prudish if you are uncomfortable. This was definitely his cover: that it was nobody’s business if he was cheating on his wife.I saw him become obsessed with the odd A-list actress, promising to win them an Oscar. But these were not private meetings. There were always plenty of people in the room.I haven’t spoken to the press before. I felt this wasn’t about me: it is for those people who have alleged assault to take up the story. But I don’t want to be in the business of protecting the Weinstein company, either. And my perspective is useful. I can completely believe that people who worked for him didn’t know about the extent of his conduct.He was a horrible, manipulative bully he would mimic people when he was shouting at them. We were all adults, but you were made to feel 17. You had to think about it really carefully: how much is this job worth?I used to have this horrible feeling of, what if my partner or family saw me when he was yelling at me? It would be very humiliating. And this was all the time – not in the heat of production. You couldn’t believe the good things that he said because then you had to believe the bad things, too. You had to say to yourself: this is him freaking out, it’s not my fault. Fairly often his screaming involved a boast about himself: I can call the president, and I can call this person. He was telling us how important he was, and it was tiring but we would laugh about it afterwards.Sometimes he’d scream at you in front of someone you respected or had worked with, and that bothers me to this day – that they would let it pass. Everyone wanted to get their movie made, and I understand that but I feel sick that his bullying was allowed to flourish in public and no one ever said, “This isn’t acceptable.” If you raised it, you were laughed off as naive there was the underlying feeling that maybe you just weren’t good enough to really impress him. This was – bluntly – bullshit. Plenty of stupid people could rise through the ranks, and plenty of great people were lost to the company because of Harvey’s bullying. I think behaving as outrageously as he did, and no one doing more than shaking their head or laughing nervously, made him believe he had all the power. He felt untouchable.There was the odd male assistant. They were always quite tall and good-looking, and they were resented and envied by Harvey. His insecurities were close to the surface, and his awareness that he was not an attractive man was quite evident. He also felt less able to bully them – or maybe the bullying took a different form.He was good at currying favour. He would hunt down a first edition to send to someone with a note: “We should make this sometime.” I would see him with some people – actresses, film-makers – and think, “This does feel like grooming” and hope they knew what they were getting into. I would look at some of the people and think: this is not right – they were not likely to be actually professionally good. There were people who would do two or three meetings and then say, “I’m not doing this again.” He would be asking them to come, and they would be busy, and alarm bells would be ringing. In those instances I think they had twigged what was coming. We were all across his email. We just thought he was an intensely energetic philanderer – we’d joke about the amount of people who wanted to sleep with him. There were a lot it didn’t feel as if he was only a predator. Women would come up to him, give him their numbers – very, very beautiful women, models and actresses. We would work in the car with one of Harvey’s girlfriends there. They felt like transactional relationships, although he never really carried cash.I don’t want to imply I don’t believe those who have come forward, because all those accounts make so much sense now. It’s horrible how could none of us have connected the severity of his bullying with how that might be expressed through his sexual side? I didn’t love the role of keeping the family busy: that felt a bit gross. It was not explicit, but we had to make sure that his wife or kids should not go to his hotel room: “It’s not a good time.” I was part of that we all endorsed and stood beside him. I feel bad about his fixation with certain things, and with two or three famous actresses. He had crushes and would try to insist on having meetings without their partners or agents present. Thankfully, those meetings never really transpired. I thought the actresses were the powerful ones. Now, I wonder.He used to say, “See me like a king. I’m your pass to places.” He learned the things you wanted from the job, and he would hold that over you as a carrot, to do better. But I left because life was too short. We were coming up to a round of festivals and I thought, I am not getting much out of this. And I was beginning to feel a sense of shame I couldn’t put my finger on. I had wanted to be the sort of person who could “handle it”, but emotionally I couldn’t. I was very adrenalised and nervous all the time. I had to leave before I got fired.Harvey Weinstein is not the only monster on the hill that we need to kill. The culture that allowed him to hide in plain sight still needs to be addressed, and I think that’s barely begun. It should be embarrassing for people to scream at employees, for the fate of an entire company to rest on a bully’s whims. If he hadn’t been able to steamroller and abuse people for so long, his other, far worse behaviour might have been called out much earlier. Perhaps people are more nervous of sexual harassment lawsuits now. But I think the bullying and the culture of silence around it still flourishes.They did with me what they went on to do with many, many people: they offered me a position that no other employer would have done. I came in as the head of sales and marketing. They were very good at handing out titles that were unavailable elsewhere, and at that point they owned you. Where were you going to go?You would see some terrible stuff. I remember one time Harvey was holding a meeting in a conference room. It was standing room only. And he just went off at this woman, calling her a man’s name – Richard or something. It wasn’t even a name that could have gone either way. It was completely psychotic. In this overcrowded room of people who had got so used to the insanity, there wasn’t a whole lot of surprise. I don’t know what the effect was on that woman, but it couldn’t have been good.It’s fairly well-known that Bob was even scarier than Harvey. There was a moment at Miramax when we had this awful movie, this unwatchable movie, that had to be released in order to satisfy a video deal. In the late 80s, videos were where the money was. We had to do whatever it took to get this film opened in three or four or five markets and then throw it at the video company and get a cheque. One of those cities was Seattle and I had to commit to a certain level of advertising to get the theatre to book it, and I did. Bob came into my office one morning and said, “We’re not spending any money on that movie. Call them up and cancel ads.” And I said no: I had made the commitment.Bob got more and more frustrated. I had a cup of pencils on my desk and he started taking a pencil out of the cup, breaking it, and throwing it on the floor. One after the other after the other, and saying something to me that I still can’t understand. “Are you tight? Are you tight now?” I was bemused. Sort of enjoying the show almost.Not a lot of people left in my time. I was one of the few. We had someone senior who came running into the office one morning. Big guy, lovely guy. Red and sweating, and saying, “Someone call the police, Harvey just attacked me.” He said Harvey attacked him on the street in front of the office. That was probably his last day. I don’t think anyone called the police.For me, it was largely educational. It made me better at navigating questionable personal relationships. I’m a straight shooter, but there were lessons to be learned in terms of how to manoeuvre and how to survive under adverse conditions.I would shout back at them, but most people didn’t. They ruled with an iron fist, and you did not want to lose your job because it was a great job, except for the poisonous environment. People could escape it physically that’s the only way they were able to keep some of their top executives, because they were 3,000 miles away in California. That eventually changed, because it got so big and there was so much money that Harvey was essentially bi-coastal and 3,000 miles meant nothing.What they did best was negotiate. They were great negotiators, and even better renegotiators. They would hammer you and hammer you. And the next day come back and say, “No, that’s not good enough.” That was the way they approached life. It was them against the world, or the world against them. They were such bad managers and so paranoid that there was no room for trust, even for people who were close to them in business. It was always only ever Harvey and Bob, fighting the good fight. They trusted no one but each other, and eventually, they didn’t even trust each other.It was when I left Miramax in 1998 and tried to pursue justice that the scales really fell from my eyes in some ways, the real abuse started then. I began working for Harvey when I was only 22 and didn’t really know who he was partly through my naivety, partly through my upbringing, I happened to have the right set of tools in my personality to deal with him. I simply saw him as an unpleasant, lascivious boss and so treated him as such. I didn’t initially understand his power, or see him as the key to my future, which were the things that made so many others vulnerable to him.But the challenge turned into a nightmare when a new colleague alleged Harvey had tried to rape her while we were at the Venice film festival. I had employed her to assist me, so she was my responsibility once she told me, there was no possibility of us continuing to work for him.On going to lawyers we were told, to our horror, that our only realistic option was to make a damages claim and enter into an agreement. They told me it wasn’t worth considering going to court. It became increasingly apparent that this had little to do with justice and everything to do with money and power. I had presumed the law was above all men, but the disparity of my position and Harvey’s trumped whatever he had done the ensuing legal process ultimately broke my belief in the core values of our culture. That is more seismic than having your belief broken in one inidual.Miramax was represented by one of the most powerful “magic circle” law firms on the globe, Allen \u0026amp Overy. Even though the allegations were of a serious criminal nature, a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) was negotiated that, as far as I can see, was wholly unethical. The agreement includes things that were legally extraordinary. Under its terms, my colleague and I would not be able to speak to a doctor, counsellor or accountant about what had happened, without them also signing an NDA, which we would be held accountable to if they broke it. The most sinister of these clauses stipulated that I was to use my “best endeavours” not to disclose anything in a civil or criminal case brought against Weinstein. In other words, I was to keep quiet, whatever the circumstances, for ever. The NDA took hours of complex and stressful negotiations in Allen \u0026amp Overy’s offices. The experience was one of complete siege mentality, with sessions lasting up to 12 hours. On one day, after a full morning’s negotiations, we resumed at 5pm and finished at 5am the next day. You lost track of time and space. We were two young women shut in a room full of lawyers talking in legal riddles, and we were not able to tell anyone what we were doing.From the beginning, it was imperative to me that money never changed hands. But it was made very clear that a financial demand was the standard and only formula. At this point, our entire motivation became focused on the fact that, if we could not prosecute Harvey, then we had to stop his behaviour and protect people in the future, in exchange for our silence. Other obligations that were agreed were that Harvey would have to attend therapy for three years, and that Miramax would be forced to inform Disney (its parent company) or fire him if any further settlements were attempted. I don’t believe anyone had tried to do this before it seems clear from the horrifying list of further allegations that have since emerged that his side of the agreement was not upheld.I always felt we were being made to do something we didn’t want to do. However, it wasn’t a simple situation and it was not just about me. My colleague was in a very psychologically vulnerable position, having experienced extreme trauma in the first few weeks of her job, and we were being given frightening advice with few options. I had no choice but to do what our lawyers were telling us, even if it wasn’t what I wanted to hear.Harvey insisted on being present on the day we signed the agreement. He apologised for his behaviour and offered us anything we wanted to return to the company. This was the first time my colleague had seen him since the attempted rape and it was obviously very distressing and intimidating. There seemed to be no protection within the system to stop this. His words that day were essentially an admission, all of which was noted down by our lawyer. But when we got up to leave, Harvey’s team insisted the notes be destroyed.My film career came to a halt after that. It’s a small industry, and there were whispers and rumours. No one knew what had happened, of course, but after several uncomfortable interviews, it became clear people didn’t want to risk upsetting Harvey, and I couldn’t defend my reputation.My goal now is to ensure that NDAs cannot be weaponised and used to hide criminal behaviour. Law firms have been enabling questionable behaviour and making money out of these agreements. And this is not just limited to sexual harassment it is far more insidious within our work culture. My NDA would have been unenforceable, but this was never made clear to me and I lived in fear of it for 20 years – until last year. I felt I had been criminalised and that, if I spoke, I would be the one going to jail.There will always be characters like Weinstein we can’t deny the existence of charismatic, sociopathic and dangerous characters, and they seem to people the top echelons of most businesses. But as a society, we have a responsibility to make sure that employees are protected – and that if they are abused, they have true recourse.There is a place for NDAs, but they have become an immoral tool, legally used to silence victims. The circumstances in which they are created need to be carefully examined, and regulated.Earlier this year, I gave evidence to MPs at a select committee inquiry to examine sexual harassment in the workplace, and the improper use of NDAs. The lawyer who negotiated my NDA from Allen \u0026amp Overy gave evidence immediately after me. I was sitting right behind him, watching his neck getting redder and redder as he was asked whether he had produced an agreement that could pervert the course of justice. I got terrible nervous giggles, because I hadn’t expected the MPs to be so aggressive. Unfortunately, the representative sent to the inquiry from Simons Muirhead \u0026amp Burton (my solicitors 20 years earlier) had not been involved with my case.My argument was not with the inidual lawyers, nor even with the firms. My argument is with the fact that they were doing something apparently legal. A positive thing to have emerged from the inquiry is that the Solicitors Regulation Authority is now investigating this, and the recommendations made by the select committee, mean there is a real chance that significant change will come. If power and money put you above the law, then the law is worth nothing. And that, fundamentally, is more frightening and dangerous than an ego out of control.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f19a5e40359d2b16454b886c43e32afa8cb56e60/1077_80_6875_4125/master/6875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2c86993dd7d3f15b3f255b3e5cbdd5","title":"pop stars in films a star is born lady gaga","story":"As Lady Gaga’s silver-screen version of (almost) herself in a Star Is Born reaches cinemas, we look back at other reinventions, from Whitney as Rachel to Beyoncé as Deena‘Having something to say is one thing having a way to make people listen is a whole other bag.” This is what an awestruck Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) tells fledgling singer-songwriter Ally, played by Lady Gaga, in the newest and shiniest remake of A Star Is Born. Premiering last month at Venice film festival to rave reviews – and early Oscars buzz for both Cooper and Gaga – it is, as Variety’s Owen Gleiberman put it, “a transcendent Hollywood movie”. As far as pop music is concerned, the messenger matters.Like the traditional Hollywood musical, pop star movies follow the familiar arc of an artist finding their voice – and, best of all, feature real pop stars. As a pop music superfan who struggles with musicals and the tiresome way they crowbar narrative into song and dance numbers, I’m obsessed with this movie subgenre. They’re fascinating as vehicles for stardom – and revealing about the kind of icons the pop stars turned actors want to be associated with, as well as the legacies they wish to leave themselves (consider Diana Ross as Billie Holiday in 1972’s Lady Sings the Blues, and Beyoncé as a version of Diana Ross in Dreamgirls). In an age of hyperdocumentation, pop stars are more precious than ever about how their star personas are perceived. Yet in the reflection of another’s star image, we can often see them more clearly.They can be based on real people, like Gregory Nava’s under-appreciated Selena (1997), which featured Jennifer Lopez – now a successful actor in her own right – as the late Tejano music a Selena Quintanilla, or imagined ones, like Whitney Houston’s Rachel Marron in The Bodyguard (Mick Jackson, 1992), possibly the greatest pop star movie of all time. That film starred Houston at the apex of her fame, making for a metatextual masterpiece that captured her luminosity at its brightest, before it flickered as she declined into drugs.They can be Oscar success stories, like 2006’s Motown musical Dreamgirls, for which American Idol finalist Jennifer Hudson won the award for best supporting actress (her fizzing performance makes co-star Beyoncé look like a half-empty can of flat Coke). They can also be the stuff of Golden Raspberry lore, for example Glitter (2001), a tragically bad, 80s-set box-office flop that features Mariah Carey’s botched cover of Tom Browne’s Funkin’ for Jamaica (NY) on the soundtrack. It saw Carey receive a Razzie for worst actress (probably not helped by the film’s release date, just one week after 911).If you’re lucky, you might get two pop stars in the same movie – 2010’s Burlesque starred Christina Aguilera as a small-town waitress who moves to Los Angeles and winds up singing in a nightclub run by – wait for it – Cher.Some pop star movies are misunderstood, like the Shonda Rhimes-scripted Crossroads (2002), which followed Britney “Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman” Spears as she road-tripped in search of her estranged mother, writing songs with strange boys en route. Others, like 2008’s Cadillac Records, which tried and failed to channel the world-weary soul singer Etta James via a stiff-backed Beyoncé, are simply miscast. Sometimes pop stars are just silver-screen versions of themselves either played straight, like Eminem’s Detroit rapper on the rise, Jimmy “B-Rabbit” Smith, in the autobiographical 8 Mile (2002), or as straight parody (the Spice Girls movie, Spice World, an endearingly wacky satire on fame and the free press directly inspired by the Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night).According to Martha Shearer, lecturer in film studies at King’s College London, pop star films “have been a significant component of Hollywood cinema going back to the coming of sound”, with some of the biggest stars of the studio era, like Bing Crosby and Doris Day, making their name as pop singers first. The key turning point, she says, was in the 1980s, when films became increasingly driven by the popularity of their soundtracks. Or, more specifically, two years earlier, in 1978, with Grease.Based on the 1971 stage musical of the same name, it made use of pop stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, both of whom had enjoyed chart hits (Travolta with Let Her In in 1976, one year before he starred in John Badham’s Saturday Night Fever Newton-John with the singles If Not For You and Banks of the Ohio in 1971). In the US, the soundtracks for both Saturday Night Fever and Grease were the No 1 and No 2 two bestselling albums of the year. It was a watershed moment that signalled an appetite for these kinds of movies and set a precedent for the Grammy-winning soundtrack to The Bodyguard to make history as the first album to sell more than a million copies within a one-week period.It’s not unfair to expect pop stars to be able to act. “Singers often make fabulous actors… all singing is acting”, writes Stephanie Zacharek in Time’s review of A Star Is Born. And the writer and founder of music website Popjustice, Peter Robinson, says: “Booking an actual singer for the job does a lot of the heavy lifting for a screenwriter or director. You see Gaga and you think of talent, hard work, and a sense that this person deserves to make it because, well, this face you recognise made it in real life.”Bradley Cooper’s casting of Lady Gaga as an ingénue on the rise is pitch perfect. Stripped of the bells, whistles and wigs that served as a fundamental part of her real star persona, the singer we see on screen is a gooseflesh-inducing volt of electricity. Cooper’s fading country-rock star encounters Gaga’s Ally a drag show in a e bar – a detail that revels in Gaga’s real coming of age in drag bars on Manhattan’s Lower East Side (the same is true of French pop star Héloïse Letissier, who was reborn as Christine and the Queens in London’s Madame Jojo’s). Masked by dramatic 1930s-style eyebrows and painted red lips, Ally belts out Edith Piaf’s La Vie En Rose with the commanding, easy confidence of somebody who has performed to a crowd a thousand times before, even finishing with a Flashdance-style dip.A Carole King poster hangs in Ally’s bedroom, but before long a star-making viral video of Shallow lands her a major label record deal with Interscope (to whom Gaga is signed), and she’s swapping her acoustic guitar for hip-hop choreography to match the manufactured R\u0026ampB pop assigned to her. Her mousy hair is dyed bright red, not unlike Britney’s in the video for her 2003 single Toxic. Seeing this version of Ally on stage at the Grammy awards doesn’t exactly feel like a suspension of disbelief.In A Star Is Born’s emotional centrepiece, Ally joins Jackson on stage to sing, and the film invites the audience to forget, for a moment, that they are watching a master of her craft who has spent the best part of 10 years selling out arenas. Yet it’s convincing precisely because Gaga has lived a version of this character. As she said in an interview with Vogue, her “natural state” is “dancing and crying”.Shearer says that while performance scenes like this can help to create authenticity, the presence of a real pop star can also “exacerbate the tension between narrative and the standalone attraction of musical performance where the narrative seems like a flimsy excuse”. Robinson is similarly sceptical about how A Star Is Born might be received. “I think Gaga’s fanbase will approach that recognition factor quite differently,” he says, explaining that the film might be seen as “a career lifeline for someone whose biggest days as a pop star were the best part of a decade ago”.Yet the film is less a resuscitation of Gaga’s career than it is a defibrillator to the musical melodrama, a genre that has been sadly dormant since The Bodyguard. Cooper’s A Star Is Born is the fourth retelling of a classic story whose earlier iterations starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March (1937), Judy Garland and James Mason (1954), and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson (1976). For Robinson, there’s irony in Gaga – an artist known for writing her own material – “launching her acting career in a film that’s essentially a cover version of a cover version”. But A Star Is Born cheekily acknowledges its legacy, with Jackson telling Ally that pop music is “the same story told over and over again”.All the artist can offer the world is how they see it, he says. Indeed, in the film’s closing credits, the woman born Stefani Germanotta is billed as Lady Gaga.A Star Is Born opens on 3 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8303498d1661a2d8e3b66f1b8818ab0c753ae998/0_177_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=598993f19edbae4fed31cecd31a9a4d3","title":"how france fell in love with the burger","story":"French food: so good that the wise heads at Unesco declared it part of the world’s intangible cultural heritage, so celebrated that the love of it defined a nation.“Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are,” as the original foodie, the gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, put it in 1825. And he was somebody who undoubtedly knew his lentilles vertes du puy et caviar from his langoustines à la nage and his poulette du perche from his poitrine de grive.For years, France’s eating habits – and not just in restaurants – have been a model: portion control lots of basics (eggs, butter, bread, potatoes) little processed or fast foods plenty of fish, fruit, vegetable oils and (of course) full-fat dairy structured, convivial, family-centred meals. French women, after all, do not get fat.So why, last week, did a new report suggest that 30 million people – nearly half the country’s population – could be obese by 2030? And how come, on a sunny lunchtime in early autumn, there is a queue outside McDonald’s – one of 1,440 in France, the chain’s second-biggest global market – on the Boulevard des Italiens in central Paris?“I can’t believe you’re asking this,” said Stephane Loiseau, a 29-year-old account manager tapping his order – “un CBO” (chicken, bacon, onion) with fries – into the touchscreen. “It’s such a cliché. They’re cheap, they’re fast, they use pretty OK ingredients. Why should the French be any different from the rest of the world?”Natalie Girardot, a sales assistant at a nearby jeweller’s store, was equally dismissive. “You know they use all-French ingredients?” she said, pointing at her tray. “Look: Charolais beef, fourme d’Ambert cheese on the top. Plus a proper vinaigrette. France loves McDonald’s. It always has done.”That’s not strictly true. Twenty years ago next year, a pipe-smoking, mustachioed sheep farmer called José Bové famously dismantled a half-built McDonald’s at Millau in southern France with a group of fellow smallholders and ex-hippies, launching a national crusade against la malbouffe – junk food.“They’re part of our national cuisine now,” said Sara Vérier, a bank worker and frequent restaurant-goer. “Almost every place – even some really quite smart ones – does at least one. You get nice French touches: a wedge of foie gras, roquefort. Sometimes even truffles.”Bernard Boutboul, Gira Conseil’s managing director, describes the burger’s seemingly unstoppable rise in France as “a euphoria, a craze” that has now started to verge on “hysteria”, with posh burgers outselling French bistro classics such as duck breast and boeuf bourguignon in many restaurants.Increasing time pressure (no more two-hour lunches the average French worker now takes a 31-minute break at midday, according to one survey) and the emergence of home-delivery services such as Deliveroo and UberEats have seen the country’s fast-food sector expand exponentially.Fast food “doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t eat well,” said Josiane Bouvier, a geography teacher, emerging from Nous, an organic takeaway on rue du Châteaudun, with an unFrench-sounding “hotbox” of grilled chicken, mint yoghurt sauce, seasonal salad and wholegrain rice. “I think many French people who go even to fast-food places are very conscious of the quality of ingredients, and whether dishes are really made on the premises,” she said. “But that’s if you can afford nine, 10 or 12 euros for lunch out.”And there’s the thing. Good food is no longer cheap in France – in restaurants or at home. The country’s food processing and distribution firms are big and powerful. French eating habits, the national food agency Anses says, are no longer a model: now it involves more and more highly processed foods, too much salt, and not enough fibre.For all its particular relationship to food, France is far from immune to la malbouffe. MPs reported last week that as many as 30 million French people, mainly in lower-income households, will be obese or overweight by 2030 unless big food firms slash salt, sugar, fat and other additives and children are educated to eat more healthily.“French families spend less money and less time on their food than ever before,” said one MP, Loïc Prud’homme. “We need to take back control of our plates.”Another, Michèle Crouzet, who has campaigned for less salt in food, was blunter. The French “are not dying of too much food,” she said, “but little by little, the food we eat is killing us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/174c3115f23d9b3ac83403f3773e7abc85e9f24a/0_0_3123_1874/master/3123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e425d307daa5bbdae1fb7621d4d7af15","title":"chelsea liverpool premier league match report","story":"There were two minutes of normal time remaining when Daniel Sturridge – so new to the game there could not have been a scuff of grass on his kit – let fly with an elegant swish of his left boot. Liverpool had given everything to conjure up an equaliser and Sturridge struck just as it had started to seem futile. His goal was a beauty and the body language of Jürgen Klopp’s players at the final whistle made it clear they could live with giving up their immaculate run in the Premier League.Nobody could argue, either, that it was undeserved, bearing in mind the number of chances Liverpool passed up before Sturridge deceived Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper, with the swerve and trajectory of his high, angled shot.Mohamed Salah, one of the repeat offenders, had already left the game by that point, substituted on an evening when he missed more chances than he will probably wish to remember. His replacement, Xherdan Shaqiri, proceeded to squander his side’s most inviting chance and, at that stage, it seemed as though the only consolation for Liverpool could be that it was another six months before they were due to face Eden Hazard again.Twice, they have faced Chelsea in four days and on both occasions Hazard has advanced the point that, while Liverpool have their own elite performers, none is currently playing with his level of expertise. Again, Hazard scored a classy goal to emphasise the point.He was always alive, the game’s outstanding performer, and on this evidence Chelsea’s supporters should probably just cherish him while they can. In one television interview, Hazard acknowledged what everyone probably knew anyway: that, yes, he had wanted to leave after the World Cup and it was still his ambition to play in Spain.Chelsea clearly have their work cut out to keep hold of him beyond this season but, if this is his final year at Stamford Bridge, he seems determined to leave a wonderful portfolio of memories.Ultimately, though, Hazard was playing for a team that struggled to match Liverpool’s authoritative passing. The visitors certainly moved the ball in the manner of a team with serious aspirations to finish the season with Manchester City, not just Manchester United, in their rearview mirror. They never seemed too disheartened as their missed chances racked up and there was something profoundly impressive about the way they took the game to their opponents.A lot of visitors to Stamford Bridge, facing a side that had won all their previous home games, might have set off with a measure of restraint. Not Klopp’s men. They attacked in numbers and the only possible criticism, much like their previous away game at Tottenham, was that they did not accept a greater percentage of their chances.For that, Salah was not the only culpable player, but it was unusual to see him being so profligate, and tempting to think that increasingly familiar facial expression – a look of smiling disbelief, eyes raised to the skies – displayed the telltale signs of fraying confidence.To say Salah is falling short of last season’s heights would be to omit the fact he is still stretching opposition defences, always showing for the ball and, for long periods, a difficult, elusive opponent. It is true, nonetheless, that some of that precious magic has temporarily deserted him. Not all the subtle flicks and touches are coming off. A few passes are going astray that he would normally expect to have completed as a matter of routine.Twice, at 0-0, Salah let Chelsea off the hook and when he did go round Arrizabalaga, shortly after the half‑hour mark, Antonio Rüdiger had sprinted across to clear from the goal-line.Hazard, on the other hand, oozed confidence. The Belgian was a constant threat, continuing where he left off in the Carabao Cup match at Anfield on Wednesday, and the excellence of his goal should not be underappreciated.The low, diagonal shot to pick out the corner of Alisson’s net, connecting with the ball on the run and firing in left to right, was impressive enough, but Hazard had actually set everything in motion 40 yards back with an elegant flick in the centre circle. He was on the move immediately and, in this slick exchange of passes, Mateo Kovacic’s through ball provided the shooting opportunity. Hazard’s speed and movement took him away from Joe Gomez, who is hardly a slouch, and Liverpool had conceded a first-half goal for the first time in the league this season.Although the away team had the better of the game, Chelsea could always be encouraged by the problems Hazard was creating and the gaps that occasionally appeared in Liverpool’s defence.It was the home side who were playing on the counterattack but they did so effectively and can reflect on two fine chances of their own when Willian and then Hazard sprung the Liverpool defence. For the first one, the 50-yard pass from David Luiz to send Willian clear was one of the game’s outstanding moments.Hazard’s chance originated from N’Golo Kanté’s quickly taken free-kick. On both occasions, however, Alisson was quickly off Liverpool’s goal-line to block the resultant shots.For the most part, it was Liverpool on the front foot and Klopp was not exaggerating when he said that his team could have won, never mind drawn.Shaqiri could not get a clean connection when Andy Robertson’s cross left him with the chance to equalise. Sturridge, however, caught his shot beautifully. Klopp had brought him on after 86 minutes. It was Sturridge’s first effort at goal and a wonderful moment for a player whose previous appearance at this ground, in April, could hardly have been a greater contrast: on loan at West Brom, and lasting only four minutes before he was taken off injured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fdbe5f89c05da668fc840c2a047e7b6616a9425/1788_171_2058_1235/master/2058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25193e0071bdc241e3637a9cf661e29b","title":"jose mourinho var manchester united west ham","story":"José Mourinho criticised the mentality and spirit of his Manchester United players, while also hitting out at the match officials after witnessing a dismal 3-1 defeat at West Ham.The manager, already under pressure after last Saturday’s home draw with Wolves and the Carabao Cup exit against Derby, chose to talk up the personality of Scott McTominay, the 21-year-old defensive midfielder whom he drafted in on the right of a back three. Mourinho being Mourinho, it was clear that what he left unsaid about the other, more senior players was damning. “I can have complaints with quality and mental approach,” he said. “You have to try always and that is my nature as a football professional.”At the end of a difficult week when Mourinho stripped Paul Pogba of the club’s vice-captaincy and clashed with him during training, he substituted the midfielder on 70 minutes. Pogba had been poor.Mourinho left his press conference after only three questions – to which he gave extensive answers – and before he could be asked about Pogba.The former United defender Rio Ferdinand was highly critical of events at the club. “You can’t let a situation like this continue through the season,” he said on BT Sport. “Things leaking out in the press, little wars going on within the changing room that are creeping out, players on one side maybe, Mourinho on the other. If that continues, it’ll be one of the worst seasons in the history of the club. Something’s got to give.”Mourinho dropped the out-of-form Alexis Sánchez because, he said, he wanted to get Anthony Martial in the team. He explained that he switched to a 3-5-2 formation, with Martial as the second striker, partly because he did not trust the Frenchman to defend diligently. “I want to play Martial – something that you are asking for a long, long time – and I left Alexis out,” Mourinho said.“At the same time, I feel that we need quality on the ball building up from the back and Scott McTominay has that quality. Everything that left his foot was correct – a part of a special character a special personality that the team in a negative moment needs. A team in a negative moment needs the kind of mentality Scott McTominay has.”Mourinho was asked whether enough of his other players had that mentality. “Not all of them,” he replied. “But every player is a different person. Scott McTominay is a kid with a special character.”Mourinho was more forthcoming on the subject of the officials. He felt that Pablo Zabaleta was offside before he crossed for Felipe Anderson to open the scoring and he highlighted a foul by Zabaleta on the substitute Marcus Rashford that was not given in the buildup to Marko Arnautovic’s third goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/478f8dd8e1285618c283454f2d94d916897f7508/0_161_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30638e40df4b277e4e96838074f189dc","title":"real madrid atletico madrid la liga match report","story":"Before this game began, Real Madrid’s players were handed the trophies they had collected at The Best gala last Monday, and there were two World Cup winners on the other side, but for all the talent on the pitch it was the men wearing gloves who decided the derby. For the sixth successive year, Atlético Madrid left the Santiago Bernabéu unbeaten in the league. Above all, Jan Oblak and Thibaut Courtois departed undefeated: in a game of few chances there were three one-on-ones, but the goalkeepers stood tall. And so a game Atlético edged in the first half and Real dominated in the second finished goalless.In Bale’s absence, Real took a step up after a first half in which they might have found themselves behind and which had been difficult from the start, Saúl Ñíguez bringing a save from Courtois after just two minutes and Antoine Griezmann’s overhead kick slicing wide three minutes later. Griezmann probably should have put Atlético ahead on 18 minutes. Released by Koke, dashing behind the Madrid defence, he ran into the area, where Courtois came to meet him. With the outside of his left foot, Griezmann tried to flick the ball beyond the Belgian but it came back off his head.That was to prove the first of two decisive saves, as Atlético sped up, the ball moved swiftly – although Real too had their moments. Saúl bent a shot just wide then Koke’s cross hit Casemiro on the arm, Atlético appealing for a penalty next Diego Costa got away, Griezmann sending him running through ahead of Raphaël Varane and towards the six-yard box. He travelled a similar path to Griezmann and with the same outcome. Courtois slid out, his body wide, and saved with his left hand.Two superb saves from the former Atlético loanee kept Real in it and then an error from the man who replaced him almost gifted the hosts the opening goal. With Marco Asensio chasing down, Oblak tried to play the ball beyond the Madrid winger, only for the pass to hit him. There were echoes of Loris Karius but rather than rebound into the net, the ball looped back up into the goalkeeper’s arms.Bale’s removal at half-time was driven by injury, but it also meant Real shifting from 4-3-3 to match Atlético’s 4-4-2, and Real felt the benefit. Immediately, Casemiro shot over, then Asensio’s effort was stopped at the near post by Oblak. And with Dani Ceballos nominally on the left but drifting across to up Real’s numbers inside, the balance had certainly shifted the ball was Real’s now, even if chances were few.The best came when Real opened Atlético up on the left, Toni Kroos slipping the ball across for Asensio running into the area. He was clean through with the game’s best opportunity, but Oblak was out fast to deny him with an excellent save.Diego Simeone sought protection, sending on Thomas Partey to replace Diego Costa, but it was not so simple. Diego Godín gave the ball away to Asensio on the halfway line and the entire pitch was suddenly before him, fans standing and roaring at him to run. He did, but José Giménez ran too, Atlético’s other Uruguayan centre-back sprinting across to clear. In the next two attacks, neither Asensio nor Nacho could find the right pass, but Atlético were ever deeper and ever more concerned.Not that Real’s chances were plentiful. And as the substitutions came, there were moments when the visitors broke. When Luka Modric found Dani Carvajal, his shot was beaten away by Oblak, and the noise and the expectation rose, yet it was rarely met. For Atlético, the aim had become to resist, something at which they are experts. The 18-year-old Brazilian Vinícius Júnior was sent on for his debut, Lopetegui admitting his need for speed, and in the last minute he was brought down, giving Real a free-kick. A familiar face headed up for the dead ball, just as he had against Atlético in the Champions League final in Lisbon four years ago. “And Sergio Ramos scores a goal!” the fans chanted. This time, though, he didn’t. Nor did anyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93d1892c66ed8f10dbb09a116a4ca849fd474f9/0_846_3721_2232/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db12e48421c707de81e0b158cee0d3a0","title":"it was like a marriage only better the single mothers who moved in together","story":"After their relationships broke down, Jane Hoggarth and two other mothers decided to get together and create a ‘mommune’Janet Hoggarth had been a single parent for a year, mother to children aged five, three and one, and she was floundering: “The adrenaline had gone and I was hit by the forever-ness. I was struggling with the heartbreak, with being replaced. I was living a half-life,” she recalls.Then her friend Vicky called. Vicky’s relationship had also broken down, leaving her with a 10-month-old daughter, a house that was up for sale, and rent she couldn’t afford. As a temporary measure, Janet invited Vicky and her daughter Daisy to move into her spare room.Not long afterwards, Janet met Nicola, a woman she recognised from the baby-group circuit, who was living nearby in south London. They chatted and swapped numbers, agreeing that a coffee might be nice. When Nicola mentioned that weekends would be good, Janet rightly deduced that she, too, was a newly single mother.And so, more by accident than design, the women hit on a new domestic set-up: the “mommune”, as it is termed in America. And for the next two years, the three of them and their six children shared their lives: Vicky in the spare room, Nicola a weekend resident and daily visitor. “We were a family,” Janet says. “We went to the supermarket together, cooked together, ate together, shared childcare. Our parents met.” The children, she adds, “became like siblings”.“The mum house saved me,” Janet says today, seven years on. “It wasn’t a grand plan, it just seemed a practical solution. We instantly stopped feeling so broken.”The impact of living with people who understood what she was experiencing was profound for Janet. When Janet and her husband split after 11 years together, her social life died with the relationship. However hard the couple tried to share access and discourage side-taking, the situation was awkward. “If I went to something, friends were always with their partners and there I was, on my own, with the children. If anyone saw my ex with his new partner, they felt they couldn’t tell me.”In the shared house, “We all knew what the others were going through without having to explain. We shared the pain. We could be as mad as we liked,” Janet says. “If you can’t express those feelings to someone, then they are just echoing back in your face all the time.”For Vicky, the everyday, on-tap adult companionship and conversation transformed not only her emotional state but also, quite unexpectedly, she says, her understanding of family. “Very quickly it felt as if we were building a different family unit,” she says. “It was based on sharing, supporting each other. That’s what really makes a family. There was a sense of there being a plan. It didn’t feel as if there was a big gap, as if we needed someone else here.”For Nicola, too – in the house with her children at least one evening a week and each weekend – staying in the house was a source of comfort and fun. “I was the only person I knew who was orced, until I bumped into Janet and saw how we mirrored each other,” she says. “Having us all together was so important for stopping the children feeling weird, too – knowing there were others in the same boat. And we could do normal family stuff, just hanging out, having tea, going to the park.”Having initially wanted to sell up and leave town (too many memories), Janet realised she didn’t need to move on: the whole atmosphere of the house had changed. “It felt like a home again. When my ex-husband left, it had sort of died. But it had a beating heart again.” The new arrangement restored her attachment to the house she and her ex had bought and painstakingly done up as newlyweds. “The place became important to me again.”Janet, Vicky and Nicola (who slept in Janet’s son’s bunk bed when her children were away, “to avoid going back to an empty house”) settled into a domestic routine. “It was like a marriage, only better. We had a kind of invisible rota. We cooked proper dinners for each other every night. We had roles.” Janet did the paperwork. Vicky baked. Nicola cooked Sunday dinners and, she says, cleaned up after parties.Because they saw each other as much more than housemates, there were, Janet says, no petty student house-style squabbles. “We are all very neat and tidy, but also laid-back. So if there was a bit of a mess around, you just tidied it up. When you have been through something as awful as orce, that sort of thing seems like nothing.”While the adults had chosen this domestic arrangement, their children, of course, had not. Throwing them together could have created a difficult dynamic.“Making sure the children had a positive experience was paramount. We had to create a real home for them, too,” Janet says. “But just having each other’s support actually gave us the emotional space to be better parents.”There were mass outings – “rowing on the river at Richmond or going to Hyde Park, proper days out we wouldn’t have got round to on our own” – and in time the children formed bonds. These remain strong seven years after the arrangement ended. “There was real depth, so it was always much more than a play-date friendship, but without the pressure of a blended family. They didn’t suddenly have to become siblings,” Janet says.As with the adults, the children benefited from being around peers with shared experience. “The older girls in particular talked a lot about how they felt.”Discipline, a potential source of contention, was addressed. “We didn’t have the same parenting styles. Vicky was the most relaxed – they all knew she might slip them some extra sweets – but we agreed on the fundamentals, and we were comfortable telling anyone off if needed.”The children now arrange regular sleepovers. “They talk about those times a lot: the firework party where we nearly set the house on fire, the trips, the Santa-mummies, the Christmas with the tree that was so tall we had to saw the top off to fit it in the house.”The second of these Christmases, celebrated a week early as all the children were going to their fathers, featured real snow. “The amazing non-Christmas was probably my happiest ever,” Janet says.But soon after this, Janet met her new husband, Neil. “I felt I had a lot to give up. I didn’t need a relationship, so I took it very slowly,” she says.In the end, the household ran its natural course. Janet got engaged Vicky and Daisy needed more space Nicola started a new career. “We all had very mixed feelings, but it felt like the right time to un-cocoon ourselves.”Their lives remain closely connected and the women still see each other every week. Vicky’s phone, Janet says, still has her listed as “wife”. “Our friendship has been totally bound by being there when we needed each other. It has become much more than the sum of its parts.”• The Single Mums’ Mansion by Janet Hoggarth is published by Head of Zeus on 4 October.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8874ff5f991453e1c5a1b68067421db015f77f6/0_1066_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=299374d85a6527fa8b64f03c55b87ab2","title":"maye musk model mother elon musk","story":"The model, 70, and mother of Elon Musk, talks about female confidence, ageing and how she taught her children to be considerate to othersI brought my kids up as a single mother with very little money, and we survived.

Many big social media companies issued advice but did nothing to enforce it, he said.“The terms of reference of Facebook and Instagram say you shouldn’t be on it if you are under the age of 13. But they do nothing to police that. The guidelines for WhatsApp say you shouldn’t be on it unless you’re 16. But again, they don’t lift a finger.”Concern is also growing in government and medical circles about the effect of “recreational” screen use on children’s ability to learn and acquire knowledge. A study published last week in the Lancet Child \u0026amp Adolescent Health, based on a survey of children in the US, found higher levels of cognition in children whose “recreational screen time” was less than two hours a day.A report for Ofcom last year found that children aged between five and 15 in Britain spent an average of 15 hours a week online and half of 12-year-olds had a social media profile.In academic circles, debate continues over whether social media has more negative than positive effects.The use of mobile technologies such as smartphones had, it said, also been linked to anxieties about conforming with social norms and the need for “likes” – external validation of personal content posted online.However it concluded that because young people were increasingly conducting their lives online, it would probably be “futile” to attempt to protect children and young people from all online risks.“This indicates that the focus of public policy should be on how to develop resilience in young people to maintain their emotional and mental wellbeing and live safe digital lives.”Some tech companies have recognised that parents need control over how much time their children are spending online. Apple has introduced a new “screen time” feature that allows parents to restrict the amount of time children spend in front of their screens online. Facebook recently introduced a number of new tools to help users manage their time on Facebook and Instagram.These include an activity dashboard showing average time spent on each app, a daily reminder to give users an alert when they have reached the amount of time they want to spend on that app, and a new way to limit notifications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1cc13877adad39f45945304344d5bb28a4ec49c/422_120_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92c821987b34eaf486225d84ab69c3d8","title":"cambridge analytica cadwalladr observer facebook zuckerberg wylie","story":"Observer reporter Carole Cadwalladr on her investigation into the firm at the centre of a data breach that shamed Facebook and exposed foul play in the EU referendum campaign and US presidential election Earlier this year, The Observer and  broke the story that became the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was the result of a year-long investigation in which Carole Cadwalladr worked with ex-employee turned whistleblower Christopher Wylie to reveal how the data analytics firm that was behind Trump’s 2016 campaign and played a role in Brexit, had used the data harvested from 87 million Facebook users without their consent.Cadwalladr’s reporting led to the downfall of Cambridge Analytica and a public apology from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg who was forced to testify before congress. Facebook has since lost $120 billion from its share price. She won the British Journalism Awards’ Technology Journalism Award in December 2017 and the Orwell Prize for political journalism in June this year for her work “on the impact of big data on the EU Referendum and the 2016 US presidential election”.One of your first stories investigating Cambridge Analytica was published in 2017, but you had been examining the company for some time before that. Can you tell us what prompted you to start looking into it?I first heard the words “Cambridge Analytica” just a couple of weeks after the US presidential election. I’d just started researching fake news and had stumbled upon a whole seam of weird and disturbing Google search results. I’d typed “are Jews” into Google and it had suggested the search “are Jews evil?” and when I clicked on that, I got a whole page of results saying they were … it was a truly jaw-dropping moment. I then discovered an academic in the US called Jonathan Albright who’d just started mapping the fake news network. We had this late-night conversation in which we both quite freaked each other out with what we were finding and he said to me that “companies like Cambridge Analytica can use these fake news sites to track readers around the web”. I’d never heard of the company before but I put it in that first article … and that triggered an angry letter from them that set off the entire chain events that led to where we are today.One of the early pieces you wrote analysed the connection between Brexit and the US election and the threat to democracy, which became an overarching theme to your reporting on this issue. Take us through what happened in the months after that piece was publishedThe revelations then ratcheted up another level again when you reported, based on the evidence of the whistleblower Christopher Wylie, that Cambridge Analytica had contracted a Cambridge University academic to harvest the data of millions of Facebook usersIt’s been … exhausting, exhilarating, stressful, alarming and at various points, slightly terrifying. The early months last year were among the worst. It felt like the world had turned very dark and I was sitting on a lot of information that implicated a lot of important and powerful people … and I did worry about that. It’s got easier every time I’ve published – sunlight is the best disinfectant etc. But it really did take over pretty much every waking hour of my life for a very long time. And it was hard to even explain to family and friends what I was involved in … every time I tried to explain it, it sounded more preposterous.What support and encouragement were you given to continue to pursue this story?I have to say that the support of readers was absolutely crucial and was one of the things that enabled me to carry on. Not just because it helped give me the confidence to keep going, but also because it helped give the organisation confidence. It takes a huge amount of resources and resolve for a news organisation to keep publishing in the face of the kind of threats we were facing, and the support of the readers for the story and what we were trying to do really did help give my editors confidence, I think. And I’m really grateful for that.Can you tell us about the reaction that you personally have received over the past two years while working on this story, including from  readers?I’ve had lots and lots of messages and I’m ashamed that I didn’t manage to respond to many of them. When the story was unfolding, it was so incredibly busy, I was just overwhelmed by my inbox. And I still haven’t caught up. I suspect people don’t realise how incredibly small the Observer’s team is. I just had to be tunnel-visioned about getting the stories out. But it’s been really amazing and incredibly important to have had the support, especially at moments when it got quite nasty or personal, so I’m very, very grateful. Our readers are the best.What has stayed with you throughout this investigation to keep you digging away at various elements of the story?Just how powerless and vulnerable we were and still are and how there’s a class of very rich people who are taking advantage of new technologies to amass power and influence for themselves.What do you think has been the most important element of the reporting and revelations?The aspect of the story that’s had most impact has been the fallout for Facebook, from the collapse in its share price to the ongoing scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators. One of the most important revelations, though, has been about the multiple criminal acts that we now know took place during the referendum … and it’s also been one of the most frustrating. Many of the allegations have now been proven and yet simply ignored. We seem to have accepted as a country that it’s OK to break the law. I’m struggling with this at the moment as I am with the reluctance to investigate the evidence we produced of Russian interference. Even after Damian Collins, the Conservative MP who is chairing the parliamentary fake news inquiry, made clear calls for the government to say what it was doing, there’s been a deafening silence.What do you think could guard us against something like this happening in the future?Our electoral laws need to be completely overhauled. And if Facebook is going to continue to refuse to answer parliament’s questions and answer to lawmakers, I don’t believe it should be allowed to play any role in British elections.It’s a big question, but what do you think the future holds in terms of data, privacy and the will of the people in elections?I think it’s inevitable that foreign actors and rich iniduals will try to manipulate social media platforms. Their methods are only going to get more sophisticated. And while Facebook and Google remain private companies, behind closed doors, beyond the reach of lawmakers, we won’t know how."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c38868a9cf01f2311290f288b2e1c233afb216/0_1044_7913_4748/master/7913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ec0ce046df50890100a9389c026e8e6","title":"raising the state pension age has meant hardship for many women","story":"Alison Peters, 63, on how she is making ends meet until she can claim her pension at 66I live alone and, at 63, had expected to be drawing a state pension by now. As it is, I have to wait another three years, and am getting by on the minimum wage earned from my part-time job as a charity administration assistant. Last year that amounted to £2,500.Raising the state pension age has meant real hardship for many women my age, particularly for those on their own. It is difficult to reconcile this with the frequent media reports that the over-60s are using up money and resources that younger people feel they are more entitled to. Women of my age didn’t get paid maternity leave and often gave up work to be full-time parents andor carers of the elderly. Many of us have not been able to save for a private pension, and workplace pensions were not routinely offered as they are now.Moreover, the speed at which the state pension age is rising has meant that women born in 1951 have six more years of pension paid from age 60 than those, like me, born in 1954, who get nothing at all until age 66. A man said to me recently that we asked for equality and now we’ve got it, but this system certainly isn’t fair yet, as women clearly have had a far greater struggle to obtain financial security than men.I had a full-time job in London before I had children then, as my husband earned a good salary, it seemed best to become a full-time mum. We moved to a rented house in the countryside. A year later my husband left me and our three children, the same week that my mother died. Six months later my father died and the lease was up on our rented house, meaning I had to move again. My ex agreed to give us about £20,000 a year for 15 years – then I was on my own.I bought a house in the late 1990s using my share of my parents’ estate as the deposit. It cost £112,000, and the allowance from my ex-husband helped to pay off the mortgage, which was about £60,000. I took a job with a cleaning agency and let out a room to a language student, went back to college and eventually found decent part-time office work. Eighteen years later, at age 59, I sold the house for more than £600,000 and downsized. This freed up some money so that I can contribute small amounts to help my sons get on to the property ladder.I have invested £10,000 in premium bonds, which have won a few £25 prizes. I’ve also let a room via SpareRoom as a Monday to Friday let for six months, which brings in another £450 a month for half of the year. The rest of my savings are mainly in cash Isas, but now that interest rates have crashed, they provide little income.A generous neighbour gave me an old Raleigh pushbike when I moved here and, although I do still have a car, I tend to cycle whenever possible. Council tax is very high – about £140 a month with the single occupier discount. Gas, electricity, water, phone and broadband come to another £140 a month, and insurance and the car another £75 or so. The weekly supermarket shop comes to about £250 a month. I grow fruit and vegetables in my garden.I rarely go out in the evenings except for an occasional meal or a film at the local cinema. I attend a weekly yoga class, which works out at about £40 a month in term time. There are always other expenses like weddings and birthdays, and I seem to get through about £1,000 a month altogether, which allows for occasional treats such as a haircut, clothes or something for the house. I’ve started shopping in the market, the pound shop and charity shops for books, and I buy the newspaper once a week on Saturdays. This year I took a one-week self-catering holiday in Cornwall, which cost about £600 for the accommodation.I feel I should b​e a pensioner, judging from some of the questions I have been asked at job interviews. There is a lot of age prejudice in the workplace generally. I don’t feel too old and am determined to continue working if I can, despite the fact that many employers just see me as being in the “over-60s” category already.I realise that despite feeling insecure and anxious about the future, in many ways I have been lucky and have never had to ask for benefits. I may be putting my head in the sand a bit and hoping for the best rather than facing up to the reality, which is that I may actually run out of money. I just hope the state pension will still be there when I get to 66.As told to Anna Tims"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3be6f36a814fe1aa74ef7609f450c1c338e58c2/0_111_3328_1997/master/3328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=822a0b11b8358856948cd855e3c1a9ba","title":"how can theresa may avoid another terrible tory party conference","story":"Four experts give their view on how the prime minister can keep the party faithful happyIt can’t be worse than last year. That is the bottom line for Theresa May, no matter how Boris Johnson behaves. In truth, with luck and a good strategy, this could be the week she regains control of the narrative and turns the grudging respect of the party into fondness.Last year the prime minister was apologising for leading her party into minority government. This year she is six points ahead in the polls and leading the country out of the European Union. Her plan for Brexit remains the only substantive one on the table, and her declaration that “we stand ready” after Salzburg means no one can doubt her resolve.Brexit is not this week’s main event and the prime minister should direct her energies elsewhere. If she sets out a serious vision for Britain’s economy and society after we leave the EU, she will prove wrong the people who think the Tories are running out of road.She will need to be bold – pledging to jumpstart a comatose economy, fix broken markets, cut immigration and strengthen fragmented communities.However, with fewer than 180 days before Brexit, it is the right moment for leadership.Theresa May is a cautious type but this conference season will go much better for her if she breaks at least one political rule. It is often said that if she were to say publicly that she is not going to “go on and on”, this would undermine her authority. But the reality is that her party doesn’t want her to go on and on, and is quite publicly discussing who will take over.May would gain far more from saying honestly that her time as leader is limited, but that she wants to use it to protect her party from the siren calls of populism on both right and left. She could then join the debate about what sort of party the Conservatives want to be, rather than appearing delusional about her own chances.One of her strongest moments was, oddly, straight after the 2017 election, when she told MPs: “I’m the person who got us into this mess and I’m the one who will get us out of it.” She should deploy that same realism this week.The top priority for any party, but especially the one in charge, is to put the UK in the best position it can be to claim the Brexit prize. Now that the Chequers plan has essentially been rejected, it’s time to move on to a framework that should have been pursued from the beginning – a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU.But Brexit cannot be the only topic on the agenda. Once the UK has exited, it will become even more apparent which domestic policy woes the UK government alone is responsible for.Housing remains the issue of the day. Too many people – especially those on low incomes and the young – are struggling to get on to the housing ladder. The answer is clear: liberalise the housing market and build more homes.Team May’s objective is to get through conference with some modicum of authority and credibility, not mislay any members of her cabinet who despair at her Brexit strategy, and trash the team Boris insurgency. Chequers landed very badly, not just with members and the usually loyal local officials, but MPs – both Leave and Remain. The open secret over the past 15 years is that Theresa May isn’t very good. The Chequers fait accompli is like Monty Python’s Black Knight – mortally wounded but not yet dead. While Salzburg bought a little time with supporters and the electorate, the fundamentals haven’t changed.Her only way through is to: rebadge Chequers, map out a Canada-plus deal, de-dramatise her fixation with the Ireland border by offering a different backstop, and articulating a positive picture of post-Brexit. Sacking Philip Hammond would be a fillip. Whoever is writing her speech has a hell of a job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33c7298ebdb7fef5f5545400546ce407424745a3/0_12_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e3cfbdc7ac1003d70f91ac589fc9fc7","title":"no deal brexit could halt production at uk toyota plants","story":"Boss of Derbyshire facility says disruption could last ‘hours, days, weeks – even months’Toyota has said production at its UK factories would be disrupted for weeks or maybe months if Theresa May failed to strike a Brexit deal.The Japanese manufacturer is the latest foreign carmaker to say there could be temporary stoppages and possible job losses if there are checks at Dover and Calais as a result of no agreement.“My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory,” Marvin Cooke, the managing director of the company’s plant in Burnaston, told the BBC.Asked how long the production stoppages would last, he said: “We can’t predict. It could be hours, days, weeks – even months.”His warning follows statements by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and BMW about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the British car manufacturing industry, which employs more than 186,000 people directly and more than 856,000 indirectly.Greg Clark, the business secretary, described the warning as “concerning”. He told the BBC’s Today programme the Chequers Brexit proposal was “a very practical set of proposals precisely calibrated to avoid those checks”.He said he disagreed with the assessment that the EU had rejected Chequers and said there would be a heavy price to pay across the EU with car manufacturers if a deal were not struck.But he admitted Britain would lose its status as one of the world’s leaders in car innovation without an agreement. “To see that slip through our fingers is something that we would regret for ever,” he said.The Toyota plant near Derby is one of nine the Japanese carmaker has in the UK and is the home of the Auris and Avensis models. Toyota has plans to take on 400 new staff as part of a £250m investment in a new production line for an updated Corolla.It produces cars worth £12m a day, with components arriving every 37 minutes as part of the “just-in-time” production process, which means car manufacturers do not store parts in on-site warehouses.Instead, Toyota’s factories rely on the smooth delivery of parts from within the UK and especially Europe, from where 1,000 lorries a day cross the channel with parts for car manufacturers in Oxford, the Midlands, the north and the north-east.Cooke said the carmaker was looking at its options for storage, but checks and delays would add costs to the bottom line permanently.“It would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly, that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs,” he said.Last week, Honda said it would look to stockpile some components as a contingency measure. Earlier this month, JLR announced 2,000 staff would move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant – hours after the company was accused of “scaremongering” by a Brexiter MP.BMW announced it was planning to shut its Oxfordshire plant for a month to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eae70004f867a7ed6b605076a8705f0aca2ef8a/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0232bc54d6b57a69f211701d73d5474","title":"tory conference app flaw reveals private data of senior mps","story":"Images posted to social media show people accessing data of senior Tories such as Boris Johnson and Michael GoveA major flaw in the Conservatives’ official conference mobile phone application has made the private data of senior party members – including cabinet ministers – accessible to anyone that logged in as that particular conference attendee.The data of hundreds of attendees to the Tory conference could be viewed by second guessing attendees’ email addresses, with Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Gavin Williamson and others among those whose personal information – including their phone numbers – was made accessible.Once logged into the app, users were able to both amend and make the personal details of prominent MPs public. Twitter users claimed Johnson’s picture had been briefly changed to one featuring a pornographic image.Gove’s picture was changed to Rupert Murdoch, his previous employer at the Times. Anyone could log in as any attendee by providing an email with no password. Many MPs had registered with their public parliamentary email addresses, making it simple for any member of the public to access their mobile number via the app.Commentators said the flaw raised questions over the ability of the government to harness technology to solve issues around the Irish border and customs checks. The app may also have breached data laws. Its privacy policy states that it “complies with … the European Union’s general data protection regulation (GDPR)”.The breach enraged senior ­ministers. One Whitehall source described the error as “fucking ­ridiculous”. Anger was immediately aimed at Brandon Lewis, the Tory party chairman whose duties include overseeing the conference.Labour said that the mishap raised questions around national ­security and recommended the Tories provide computer training to their members. “How can we trust this Tory government with our country’s security when they can’t even build a conference app that keeps the data of their members, MPs and others attending safe and secure?”, said John Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister.“The Conservative party should roll out some basic computer security training to get their house in order.”The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said it would be ­making inquiries about the breach and added that “organisations have a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure”.Under GDPR, organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, if it could pose a risk to people’s rights and freedoms. The app’s privacy policy states that it complies with the EU’s GDPR.A Momentum spokesperson criticised the “staggering incompetence” of the Conservative party and cited the success of its own in-house app during the Labour party conference this week.“This sums up the Tories, staggeringly incompetent and out of touch with the modern world,” they said. “They can’t even build a basic conference app without a huge data breach, and it’s terrifying that they’re in charge of the tech that runs our hospitals, schools and airports.“Our conference app was built by a team of volunteers for next to no money, and I’m sure they’d be happy to give the Tories a few tips for next year.” columnist Dawn Foster was among the first to notice the flaw and swiftly raised the alarm on Saturday.“The Tory conference app allows you to log in as other people and view their contact details just with their email address, no emailed security links, and post comments as them,” she tweeted.“They’ve essentially made every journalist, politician and attendee’s mobile number public. Fantastic.”The app, created by an Australian firm called CrowdComms, was updated and the login function removed after concerns were raised with the party.The Conservative party said in a statement: “The technical issue has been resolved and the app is now functioning securely. We are investigating the issue further and apologise for any concern caused.”The prime minister, Theresa May, refused to respond to questions from reporters about the embarrassing security blunder as she arrived in Birmingham.It follows the gaffe that unfolded last year during Theresa May’s keynote speech when a comedian managed to get to the front of the stage and pass her a P45, which she accepted.The set behind her – featuring the slogan ‘“Building a county that works for everyone”’ – soon began to fall apart, and she lost her voice, prompting the shadow chancellor, Phillip Hammond, to offer her a cough sweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0642f5d209db4721e840d753cd442289193a2c13/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f0069aaf5387db73b290e9184c54431","title":"tory mp says she would back new brexit vote","story":"Heidi Allen calls rightwing critics of PM’s Chequers plan ‘economically irresponsible’ A prominent Conservative critic of Boris Johnson has said she would support a new Brexit referendum because “irresponsible” rightwingers in her party had killed off the Chequers plan.The Cambridgeshire South MP, Heidi Allen, said she would now back a second public vote on leaving the EU because of the threat to jobs and businesses in her constituency and the rest of the country from crashing out without a deal.It came as the Conservative party gathers in Birmingham before the start of its annual conference on Sunday, with Johnson at the centre of a huge row over criticism of Theresa May’s negotiations with Brussels.Allen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister, but many in the party, especially on the right, would not.Describing them as “fiscally and economically irresponsible”, she said: “They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands.“It is they who have made Chequers dead and that being the case – they have made their position totally clear – then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative other than asking, should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Allen’s comments came as the former prime minister John Major made the case for another vote and described attacks made by some Tory MPs over May’s leadership as “completely unacceptable”.Speaking at an event in South Shields alongside the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, Major said: “I do not think routine attacks on the PM in the most lurid fashion is either the spirit of politics that one would wish to see, or is it in the interest of the negotiating posture of the United Kingdom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b09bb51fea55ac9654b3a8fcef422ccd4202f8b7/0_99_3467_2080/master/3467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddbbd7eb3427726d60a4220c9c96b081","title":"uk regulator certifies use of some out of date epipens over shortages","story":"Four-month extension of use of expired EpiPens does not apply to Junior versionChildren with severe allergies who need to carry life-saving medication are being forced to rely on out-of-date EpiPens due to a global shortage of the adrenaline shots.EpiPen and EpiPen Junior devices, which are supplied by Mylan and produced by Pfizer, have faced shortages in the UK and other countries for months. But the crisis has deepened with the Junior version now unavailable.The latest stock shortages have led the medicines regulator to certify some batches of expired EpiPens as safe amid fears those with severe allergies who go into anaphylactic shock would be left with no alternative.It was forced to extend the use-by-date of some EpiPens by four months after concerns were raised from users that their current shots were due to expire and they had been unable to get replacements. However, the extension does not apply to the Junior version.A statement issued to healthcare providers on behalf of the Department of Health noted: “EpiPen and EpiPen Junior will be subject to limited availability for the remainder of 2018. Mylan are now out of stock of EpiPen Junior and interruptions in the supply are anticipated to continue for the coming months.”More of the Junior devices are expected in stock in October, but it is not clear whether these will meet demand.Manufacturing problems in the US have meant disruption for suppliers of EpiPens – the most common adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) are prescribed to those who suffer severe allergies such as to nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs or some fruits.Those affected are usually recommended to keep two AAIs with them at all times in case of a reaction. EpiPens can only be used once and have an expiry date of at least 12 months.The standard device contains 300mcg of adrenaline. Smaller 150mcg Junior AAIs are issued to children who weigh 30kg (4st 10lb) or less.Adults and older children are being advised they can use their devices up to four months beyond the listed expiry date in an attempt to maintain supply levels but the extension does not apply to the 150mcg devices for younger children.A statement from the Department of Health and Social Care to healthcare providers said: “Mylan have obtained acceptance from the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA) to extend the use of specific batch numbers of EpiPen 300mcg auto-injectors beyond the labelled expiry date for four months.”Last week an inquest heard that 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died on a flight after suffering a serious allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette containing sesame seeds. This was despite her father injecting her with two EpiPen devices.EpiPens make up three-quarters of the 340,000 adrenaline auto-injectors prescribed annually.There are two other adrenaline auto-injector devices available in the UK: Emerade and Jext. Suppliers of both medicines are working to increase their supplies to the UK over the coming months.The health department guidance said that if people were left with nothing but expired AAIs they should keep them – until they get replacements – and be prepared to use them.While AAIs become less effective after their expiry date, they are not harmful, and it is better to use an expired AAI than none at all, it said.It added that “careful management” of existing supplies would prevent the need for using expired pens.The health minister, James\u0026nbsp O’Shaughnessy, said: “We are doing everything we can to ensure patients continue to access the medications they need and we have issued detailed guidance to healthcare professionals.“Other brands of adrenaline auto-injectors are available in the UK and we are working closely with Mylan and Pfizer to find a solution to the problem as soon as possible. Any patient unable to obtain supplies of EpiPen should speak to their clinician about using an alternative brand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b5dc2ede9a5ebc94ba6f9cdc815bac8295a584/0_104_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaea8d6fc625f98943d1935c9193992f","title":"anna van der breggen wins road world championships with astonishing ride","story":"She had won gold at the Olympic Games and European Championships. She had won the Giro Rosa and La Course by Tour de France. But for so long, success at the UCI Road World Championships had proven elusive for Anna van der Breggen.On four occasions the Dutchwoman had placed in the road race top 10, including second in 2015. Three times she had won the inidual time trial silver medal, most recently on Tuesday. But as her compatriots Annemiek van Vleuten and Chantal Blaak added world titles to their palmares in recent years, the rainbow jersey remained conspicuously absent from Van der Breggen’s record.That changed here on Saturday. In an astonishing piece of solo riding, Van der Breggen bridged to a strong breakaway on the penultimate climb of the 156.2km road race. She then attacked again, effortlessly riding away from Australia’s Amanda Spratt. Completing the last 39km without company, the Boels-Dolmans rider never looked at risk of being caught.As she crossed the finish line, the relief was unmistakable. Finally, Van der Breggen could rightfully claim to be the best female rider in the world. Her 3min 42sec lead over Spratt was the biggest winning margin in decades. Italy’s Tatiana Guderzo claimed bronze.Van der Breggen had dedicated her 2018 season to the world championships, bypassing the defence of her Giro Rosa jersey and adopting an unorthodox race schedule – even including some mountain biking. But she said the singular focus had added pressure. “I was happy this morning that tonight, no matter how it went, it would be over and I could enjoy cycling again,” she said.But the smile on her face suggested it had all been worthwhile. “When I crossed the finish line it was relief – that it finally worked out,” she said. “I won it this time. I am really thankful for that.”An elated Spratt heaped praise on her victorious rival: “She was on another level. She really showed that she was so, so strong. I’m proud of the silver medal.”A total of 149 riders began the first climber-friendly world championships in recent memory, rolling out of picturesque Kufstein near the German border under sunny autumn skies. The Polish team activated the race early, with Aurela Nerlo establishing a modest lead over the peloton before being joined by Colombia’s Ana Cristina Sanabria.Or at least they did, until a crash at Gnadenwald’s base among the road furniture complicated proceedings. Van Vleuten, the pre-race favourite, and Britain’s Dani Rowe were among those to fall, with the former looking particularly shaken as she exerted herself to rejoin the peloton.Normality returned as the climb slimmed the main group to a select few, including Van Vleuten, before the race temporarily reformed on the descent into Innsbruck. But as the peloton passed a multinational crowd in the old city and headed back towards the mountains, the peloton thinned once more.Eventually, a serious breakaway of six formed, led by Spratt. When Ellen van Dijk was dropped, Van der Breggen went ahead of the chasers to ensure the orange-clad team would be represented at the front. After joining Spratt and company on the second loop of the Olympic Circuit, Van der Breggen kept going – first with the Australian and then alone.The Dutchwoman was unstoppable on the final circuit, building her lead right until the end. Rainbow stripes were a long time coming for Van der Breggen, but she finally claimed a world championship triumph for the ages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcd6d5234728b560aaa8f273c83ba217a8d00209/0_103_4786_2872/master/4786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a7b12800f39a461953eabb97a199c7","title":"bristol northampton premiership match report","story":"Another weekend, another points fest. This one topped 80, the odd try in 11 earning Northampton their second win of the season. Under Chris Boyd, the improvement in their game has been obvious here, it yielded the full five points.It meant Bristol’s first home loss of their return to the top flight fell at the third instalment, but they took two bonus points themselves to keep both sides nestled amid the customarily crowded mid-table.Ian Madigan pulled out, but his replacement, Callum Sheedy, who qualifies to play for Wales, Ireland and England, played masterfully, accruing 15 points and coaxing as much artistry from Bristol as Madigan might have done himself.If this league is meant to be damaging England’s chances of playing the vibrant rugby so ardently wished for, the logic is hard to follow. Players looked for, and found, space and, when it was not to be found, collisions of rather more than a couple of Gs kept the purists happy.In the end, the difference was a try, which made the one denied Bristol shortly before the break all the more controversial. With the score locked at 17-apiece, Andy Uren was through to the line. He had been tackled a few yards short, his knee touching the ground for a moment, but the question was whether he had been held by the tackler. The TMO thought not Luke Pearce, whose opinion counted, thought so.“I know it was a try,” said Pat Lam, the Bristol coach whose 50th birthday was spoiled here by his former club. “The TMO was right and so was the touch-judge, but Luke felt differently. I know what’s going to be said when it goes to review. It was a huge moment, because it switched from 24-17 in our favour to 24-17 the other way. But credit to Northampton.”It was a curious decision by Pearce, who cannot have seen anything the rest of us could not. If that was harsh, a penalty seemed ridiculous, but them’s the rules. All the harsher, Northampton kicked the penalty to touch, worked a few phases and suddenly Lewis Ludlam was stepping to the line at the other end. Northampton had a lead they would not relinquish.By then that lead had changed hands liberally. Dan Biggar had opened the scoring with a penalty, but the riot of tries was swift to ensue. Will Hurrell broke powerfully past Biggar for the first of his brace, after fine work by the increasingly eye-catching Harry Thacker. The hooker showcased his remarkable pace for Bristol’s second on the half-hour, but in between Northampton had scored twice – raw power accounting for Ehren Painter’s and the contrasting virtues of Northampton’s wingers for Andrew Kellaway’s.And so the match was poised perfectly before its controversial turning point. Even after that, Sheedy’s penalty reduced Bristol’s arrears to four on the stroke of half-time. Taqele Naiyaravoro, the bulldozing version of Northampton’s wingers, went through two to claim Northampton’s fourth four minutes into the second half, only for some Sheedy wizardry to lay one on for Luke Morahan four minutes later. Sheedy’s third penalty reduced the deficit to one. The game was anyone’s.It was Northampton who made it theirs. Close-quarter power was one department in which they enjoyed the edge throughout. Alex Waller and Mikey Haywood proved as much with tries of directness either side of the hour mark. Bristol were staring at a 15-point deficit all of a sudden, this time with only quarter of an hour to go.They scored twice in the remaining time, each try coming with a bonus point, each one a sweeping move of majesty. They were the scores of a team who know how to play, but everyone seems to know how to play this season. Someone is going to have to be relegated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a916a3cbf425b85528c9a81c731b0cf72ba72892/0_87_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29e8d017348a44bee64b249071fe07e8","title":"europe ryder cup usa miracle","story":"The extent of Europe’s stranglehold on the Ryder Cup is such that terminology referring to miracles is used when discussing the last time a lead such as this was overturned. A United States side apparently united as never before needs inidual skill to retrieve this situation. How poetic.Thomas Bjørn and his fearless team will take an advantage of 10-6 into Sunday’s singles session. The same margin applied overnight Saturday into Sunday – in the US’s favour – at Medinah in 2012, when José María Olazábal oversaw a recovery for the ages. Europe led 10-6 after two days at Brookline in 1999, before the US roared back. These, however, are the notable exceptions it would be a major surprise if Europe do not reclaim the cup from here.Bjørn, never a truly celebrated figure on the European Tour, is on the verge of making a mockery of the US team’s pre-tournament favourites tag. This has been a captaincy masterclass so far.Every Ryder Cup has its heroes. There is no disputing the main characters here. Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have made history by becoming the first European pairing to win four matches out of four. That Tiger Woods has featured in three of those encounters merely adds to how special this achievement is. Hollywood moments for the pair dubbed Moliwood.“We have come to do a job, not get into the record books,” said Molinari, epitomising Europe’s approach. “We still need those four and a half points tomorrow.”Woods, out of sorts and out of sync, rather sums up all that has gone wrong for Jim Furyk. The US captain never has been an extrovert character but the scale of his worry as the Ryder Cup slip, slip, slipped from his country’s grasp was clear. Furyk’s leadership this far has been without theme or, to a large extent, logic.It seemed incredible to think at one stage on Friday the European contingent wore worried expressions. The US had won this event’s first session 3-1 before a quite stunning turnaround which has left Furyk and his players on the ropes.This is an American team with camaraderie supposedly at its core. By lunchtime on Saturday, as 5-3 became 8-4, it was patently obvious that all the table tennis matches and task forces on the planet cannot account for poor form. Exhibit A was Patrick Reed, so abject in partnership with Woods that Captain America had turned into Captain Calamity. Woods has quite enough back problems without having to carry a partner.At one stage, Europe were on course to secure back-to-back session clean sweeps for the first time. Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth spared Furyk that ignominy. The scale of Thomas’s celebrations en route to a 1up success over Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm were odd, given the wider predicament of his team, but were perhaps indicative of the US’s need to cling to any kind of hope. Europe had actually won eight matches in a row when marching from 3-0 behind to 8-3 in front.Sergio García and Rory McIlroy suffered late stress in their fourball encounter with Tony Finau and Brooks Koepka. The US Open champion’s putter proved as cold as a winter’s morning in Siberia. Yet Finau offered late hope before García slammed the door shut with a stunning conversion from 30ft on the 17th. It was over, 2\u0026amp1.The excellence of Paul Casey on his return to the Ryder Cup fold has probably been overlooked. Casey combined with a rejuvenated Tyrrell Hatton for a 3\u0026amp2 victory over Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler. Moliwood did what Moliwood does as Woods and Reed were swatted aside 4\u0026amp3. That Thomas and Spieth achieved their fourball victory doused the possibility of a procession.As he has done so impressively thus far, Bjørn stuck to a plan devised earlier. Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson were united once more in the opening foursomes clash. The Europeans lost the 1st but replied with shrugs Johnson and Koepka were duly dispatched 2\u0026amp1.García and Alex Norén had achieved such a comfortable win on Friday afternoon that reuniting them made perfect sense. The US, via Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, were to bite back this time. With Norén especially off colour, Watson and Simpson prevailed 3\u0026amp2. This clash saw a Ryder Cup first: the second hole was halved in six, a triple bogey. Briefly, a monthly medal had broken out.Bryson DeChambeau stepped in beside Woods but Molinari and Fleetwood did not care Europe cantered home, 5\u0026amp4. Thomas and Spieth, shining American lights, had too much for Poulter and McIlroy when winning 4\u0026amp3. The bigger picture, though, is overwhelmingly blue.It would be folly to suggest the US cannot turn this around. Nonetheless, the weight of history – they have not prevailed on this continent for 25 years – must weigh heavily on Furyk’s mind.So, too, the widely trumpeted assertion that this is one of the finest golf teams the Americans – or anyone else – has ever assembled. Furyk’s selection of Phil Mickelson, to play the left-hander in a single foursomes session before banishing him to the benches for all of Saturday, is one of many decisions open to criticism. A captaincy “Je ne regrette rien” is unlikely to wash. Bjørn is in the home straight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca1201b64c48cac1220d3799d05759dc85e71543/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7c5beb83075048fd910f2cf40879ef0","title":"elon musk tesla 40m sec case tweets","story":"Elon Musk is to step down as chair of Tesla for three years and pay a fine after reaching a deal with the US financial regulator over tweets he made about taking the firm into private ownership.Under the settlement Musk would remain as chief executive but must leave his other post within 45 days.

I’ll be back tomorrow at 7.15pm for the very first results show, although I’ll probably be knocking around about 6.45pm in anticipation of the Countryfile Casual Weatherperson, as is traditional. Feel free to come and join in – you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens in the meantime. See you tomorrow! Time for a giant recap – I loved Joe and Dianne and Dr. Ranj and Janette this week, less keen on Susannah and Anton and Seann and Katya. My money’s on these two couples in the dance off tomorrow, but there are few in the middle I always forget about, so they might not get many votes either. Strictly is a cruel mistress.The dancing is finished! Thank goodness. The combined 2-week leaderboard has Pashley at the top and Susanton at the bottom. THE VOTING IS OPEN!!!Scores: 8,8,7,9 - a total of 32 for Pashley. Bruno’s gone early.Craig thought Ashley was good, and Darcey loved the content and performance. Ashley must be a fast learner*. Shirley loves the personality upstairs (I have no idea what this means, but it sounds FILTHY). Bruno thought it was an amazing Cha Cha disco dazzler, and Ashley’s hips don’t lie.Ashley has unleased the tinsel and the Carmen heated rollers. She has great hip action and ALL the hair. Great Cha Cha Cha basics, great performance, Pasha looks very happy. This is what we’ll get from Ashley every week until Christmas, so strap in.And FINALLY, it’s ASHLEY AND PASHA! Tonight they’re dancing the Cha Cha Cha to ‘Boogie Wonderland’ by Earth, Wind and Fire. Gird your loins for Disco Cha Cha, it’s wrapping up the show whether you like it or not. Scores: 2,4,4,5 - a total of 15 for Seann and Katya. Generous, Bruno. Katya looks like she’s absolutely had enough of this nonsense.Bruno doesn’t know what to say - it was all the right steps at the wrong time. Craig has no words – it all went horribly wrong. Darcey loved the focus and intensity, but the timing was all off. Shirley liked Seann’s hair, and gets a hug for that. Not sure what’s worse – the opening joke, the wet-look trousers or the fact they’re wearing different shades of purple. Sadly Seann and Katya appear to be Jiving in different timezones, and it’s horrible. Not even funny horrible - not sure what happened at the end, but it looks like Seann was trying to wrestle Katya to the floor and I’m a bit worried for her welfare. Was that intentional?Next up it’s SEANN AND KATYA! This week they’re dancing the Jive to ‘I’m Still Standing’ by Elton John. This presumably refers to Katya’s status after being shoved around the dancefloor by Seann last week. I really want Seann to take this seriously, I think he’s got huge potential for Strictly Journey of The Year.Scores: 5,6,5,6 - a total of 22 for Lauren and AJ. Shirley thought some bits were sensational, but other sections seemed a bit heavy. Bruno loved the lifts, but it needed more attack and sharpness in the leg action. Craig agrees, it was a bit soft in places and needed more energy, but the lifts were spectacular. Darcey wanted more quality in the transition, but her core action was very impressive.Lauren and AJ have had a barney, but they soon make up through the medium of Charleston. It’s a bit clunky for a Charleston from Lauren at the start, but she soon warms up and manages some incredible lifts. The routine works really well around her arm (which is no mean feat), but her swivel needs more welly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b574eb7c0d9f13ffdb936c491df5d3ad8c79105/0_133_838_503/master/838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7247ef5cd491b311185fd9a95de62ff","title":"fbi contacts kavanaugh accuser deborah ramirez in investigation","story":"Woman who says future supreme court nominee exposed himself to her poised to cooperate but report says third woman will not be contactedThe FBI has contacted Deborah Ramirez, a woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when he was a Yale student, as part of its renewed investigation of the supreme court nominee.Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh exposed his genitals to her at a party in the early 1980s, when they were both students in New Haven, Connecticut. Her lawyer, John Clune, said in a statement on Saturday agents wanted to interview her and she had agreed to cooperate.Donald Trump ordered the FBI to reopen its investigation after three women accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct and the first woman, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified before the Senate judiciary committee. Kavanaugh denies all the allegations.NBC News reported on Saturday that the White House had placed constraints on the investigation including that the third woman to accuse Kavanaugh, Julie Swetnick, would not be questioned. Citing “a US official briefed on the matter”, NBC said the White House controlling such a process for a presidential nominee was not unusual.On Thursday, Kavanaugh and Ford testified in an electric session on Capitol Hill in Washington.Ford, who says Kavanaugh and a friend attacked her at a house party in Maryland in 1982, gave her testimony first.Kavanaugh prefaced his testimony with angry criticism of Democrats for what he said was a politically motivated attack.On Friday, after protesters confronted the committee member Jeff Flake in an elevator in the Senate office building, the Arizona Republican requested the renewed FBI investigation. Flake nonetheless voted for the nomination to proceed to the Senate floor.Swetnick came forward on Wednesday. She said she was at parties in the 1980s where Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge – whom Ford alleges was there when she was allegedly attacked – were present when women were gang-raped.In a statement, she wrote: “In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these ‘gang’ or ‘train’ rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present.” She did not say Judge or Kavanaugh participated in the alleged rapes.Judge strongly denied Swetnick’s allegations. He has said he has no memory of the party described by Ford. He was not called to testify to the Senate judiciary committee, which is controlled by Republicans.Having disappeared from the public eye, Judge was found by the Washington Post in a beach house in Delaware. His lawyer said on Friday he would be willing to talk to the FBI “or any law enforcement agency”.Swetnick is represented by Michael Avenatti, the attorney for Stormy Daniels, the adult film star and director who says she had a sexual liaison with Trump. The president denies the affair, as he does allegations of sexual misconduct from more than a dozen women.Trump tweeted an attack on Avenatti this week, calling him a “total low-life” and “a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh”.On Saturday, Avenatti told the Post he did not “know how this investigation could be called complete” if the FBI did not contact his client.Trump, meanwhile, repeated a familiar attack on a Democratic member of the Senate judiciary committee, Richard Blumenthal, over what the president called his “fraudulent service in Vietnam”.Like Trump, Blumenthal received deferments from service as a student. Unlike Trump, he then served in the US Marine Corps without leaving the US. Before being elected in 2010, Blumenthal occasionally said he had been “in Vietnam”.Kavanaugh’s confirmation would tilt the supreme court to the right, potentially placing in question rulings on issues including abortion rights.Republicans hold the Senate 51-49 and would need a simple majority to confirm Kavanaugh. Two moderate Republican women – Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – will be key votes if the nomination reaches the floor.Democrats facing midterm contests in Republican-leaning states will also face pressure. On Saturday one, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was set to see his state host a Trump campaign rally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d842d0632a96f493d64e25d058238efe2aa9e4/0_36_2220_1332/master/2220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=542d7e4f03b16fcecefb0ce1459c11a7","title":"hear ye kanye west announces name change ahead of snl","story":"Rapper says he wants to be known as ‘Ye’ as he prepares to launch new album YandhiKanye West has announced he is now to be known as Ye.

Newly tunnelled, cemented, widened and signposted, it winds through rolling hills, past vineyards and villages and wood-covered slopes all the way to Skopje, the former Yugoslav republic’s capital.The European Union takes great pride in this. At a time of impoverished connections between the two bickering Balkan neighbours, the newly paved route is concrete proof of what progress and prosperity can achieve. Every few miles a billboard proclaims it is the EU that co-funded the road’s “rehabilitation”.When Macedonians vote on Sunday in a referendum that could result in changing their country’s name – and resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece – Brussels hopes it is projects like this that will sway their ballots.A yes vote would not only see the tiny state being renamed North Macedonia but would clear the path to membership of Nato and the EU. As the military alliance’s 30th member, the landlocked republic, which came close to inter-ethnic conflict in 2001, would secure the stability and security it has long craved in a region prone to shifting borders and bloody strife.For Petre Shilegov, the mayor of Skopje, the choice is a no-brainer. “It’s very simple. Either we become North Macedonia or North Korea,” he says with strident emphasis in his airy single-storey office. “Our opponents have no plan B. They can only offer isolation.”With Macedonians facing record unemployment, economic stagnation and few prospects, the referendum offers a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to move forward. “The EU spends approximately €260,000 per day supporting Macedonia,” Shilegov explained. “If we have a yes, that sum will increase and everything in our country will get better – in our schools, in our hospitals, on our streets.”The high-stakes vote follows a landmark accord struck with Greece in June, almost 27 years after the republic seceded from Yugoslavia and declared independence.Under the deal, signed on the banks of Lake Prespa by Skopje’s social democrat prime minister, Zoran Zaev, and Athens’ leftist leader, Alexis Tsipras, Greece pledged to lift objections that have thwarted the nation’s EU and Nato integration on condition that the state agreed to amend its name by adding a geographical qualifier and dropped any claim to cherished Greek cultural figures including Alexander the Great.Athens has argued with vigour that unless distinguished from the adjacent Greek province of Macedonia, the republic’s nomenclature would forever imply thinly disguised territorial ambitions towards a region that includes the strategic warm-water port of Thessaloniki.Greeks, in return, have had to accept their neighbours as internationally recognised Macedonians who speak the Macedonian language even if, as Slavs, they bear no relation to the ancient Macedonian warrior king.On Sunday, Macedonians will be asked if they endorse the agreement once and for all.“We are very lucky to have had Zaev and Tsipras on both sides,” enthused Sasho Ordanovski, Skopje’s preeminent political commentator. “Macedonia has been a rare success story of peaceful coexistence in the Balkans,” he said of the ability of the country’s Slavic Orthodox majority and Muslim Albanian minority to live together harmoniously. “But membership of the EU and Nato will enable us to finally secure the liberal consensus to guarantee this model of multi-ethnic, cultural, multi-religious democracy.”At the heart of the Balkan peninsular, Macedonia has long been viewed as a potential powder keg with the strength to ignite a major regional conflagration, which is why the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the US defence secretary, James Mattis, have all descended on Skopje in recent weeks to back the name deal and cheer Macedonians on. “Suddenly it is as if our country is at the centre of the world,” Shilegov smiled, listing the high-profile visitors one by one. “This vote is too important to fail.”Government officials and western diplomats animatedly predict that the plebiscite will pass. But, as in Greece, the compromise it entails has elicited ferocious nationalist opposition. Until campaigning officially ended at midnight on Thursday, protesters such as Goran, in a baseball cap and floppy jacket, were handing out leaflets in Skopje’s central square exhorting pedestrians to boycott the referendum.In an atmosphere described as both febrile and calm, anti-agreement propaganda has proliferated. By the eve of the vote the republic’s myriad “fake news” farms – infamous for the role they played in disseminating disinformation before the 2016 US elections – had reportedly gone into overdrive, with opponents making widespread use of social media in an effort to suppress voter participation. Decrying the deal, President Gjorge Ivanov has urged Macedonians to boycott the referendum.A low turnout could unleash a scenario where the Zaev government is unable to persuade Skopje’s 120-member parliament to endorse the constitutional changes to push the name deal through.Shilegov, a senior figure in the ruling social democrat party, is leaving nothing to chance. In recent weeks he has been going door-to-door to convince citizens of the need to cast ballots. “People have to have an opinion about this. They just can’t stay at home and go along with the boycott.”But there are worrying signs. In recent months Moscow has intensified its campaign to spoil the vote, with the fiercely pro-Russia United Macedonia party leading the boycott drive. With its augmented staff, Skopje’s Russian embassy has been described as a hothouse of intelligence activity.Visiting the capital, Mattis warned of the perils that lay ahead, accusing the Kremlin of employing underhand means and “malicious cyber activity” to scupper the vote. While Moscow has denied the charges, it has been open in its disgruntlement over Nato’s encroachment into the western Balkans, an area long regarded as a traditional sphere of influence. “Skopje right now is a bit like Casablanca before the war,” said Trostanovski. “It is a city full of spies and operatives all watching how the vote will go.”"},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsToday\u0026rsquos graduates want more from work than just the pay chequeStudents are well-positioned as the growing economy increases employment demand for graduatesHow can graduates make sure they\u0026rsquore appreciated and what do their bosses expect in return?Personal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryHow graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersWhat is likely to pay off the most \u0026ndash investing in furthering your education or starting your career instead?Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsInternships can be an effective way to gain work experience and increase your employability \u0026ndash but is there a downside?Jobseekers can take steps to maximise their chances of getting hiredHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interview"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3646320.1538241580!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"epipen declared out of stock amid global shortage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEpiPens are the most common adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) devices.Irish children with severe allergies face difficulties with treatment as a popular medicine has been declared “out of stock” amid an ongoing shortage.The Health Products Regulatory Authority, the body responsible for co-ordinating the management of shortages of medicines on the Irish market, said it expects the shortage to be alleviated on October 10th.EpiPen and EpiPen Junior devices, supplied by Mylan and produced by Pfizer, have faced shortages in the UK and other countries for months, but the junior version is now unavailable.A statement issued to healthcare providers by the UK department of health noted: “EpiPen and EpiPen Junior will be subject to limited availability for the remainder of 2018.“Mylan are now out of stock of EpiPen Junior and interruptions in the supply are anticipated to continue for the coming months.“Mylan have obtained acceptance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to extend the use of specific batch numbers of EpiPen 300mcg auto-injectors beyond the labelled expiry date for four months.”More of the junior devices are expected in stock in October, but it is not clear whether these will meet demand.EpiPens are the most common adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) devices and are issued to people who suffer from serious allergies. People are recommended to keep two AAIs with them at all times in case of reaction.The standard device contains 300mcg of adrenaline. Smaller 150mcg “junior” AAIs are issued to children who weigh 4st 10lb (30kg) or less.Meanwhile, adults and older children are being advised they can use their devices up to four months beyond the listed expiry date in an attempt to maintain supply levels.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has agreed to a request to extend the expiry on some batches of the 300mcg devices. The extension does not apply to any EpiPen Junior devices.EpiPens can only be used once and have an expiry date of at least 12 months.Last week an inquest heard that 15 year-old Natasha Ednan-Laprose died on a flight after suffering a serious allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette containing sesame seeds. This was despite her father injecting her with two EpiPen devices.There are two other adrenaline auto-injector devices available in the UK: Emerade and Jext. Suppliers of both medicines are working to increase their supplies to the UK over the coming months. –PA "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister for Sport had questioned safety standards at Battle Arena promotionHealth Products Regulatory Authority expects shortage to be alleviated next monthSimon Harris says OPW \u0026lsquosolely responsible\u0026rsquo for accommodation and procurementRecord-matching number of players in Ireland scoop the top prize in the drawComedian lets rip at former UK foreign secretary in series of angry tweetsOver 1,500 Irish women have accessed terminations since referendum, Minister saysPresidential candidate posts footage of himself apparently hitting golf ball into the seaJapanese manufacturer said there could be temporary stoppages if there are border checksIrish chat show host says he has rejected tax avoidance schemes suggested by his advisersGarda\u0026iacute found the cannabis herb during a van search in the Collon areaThe T\u0026aacutenaiste spoke about Gaza in his speech at the United Nations general assembly in New YorkLeaked minutes show charity\u0026rsquos head office is dealing with a significant funding shortfallRebecca Carter celebrates official upgrade in exam results after winning legal caseHigh perception of corruption \u0026lsquonot reflected in reports to Garda\u0026rsquoHSE and Government prepare communications campaign for rollout of abortion services\u0026euro21m balance of externally controlled fund to be transferred to Climate Action FundFF leader says abuse of history to justify extreme views has not been so evident since the 1940sMore than 200,000 cigarettes found valued at \u0026euro112,000"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3646231.1538217314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit no deal could halt production at uk toyota plants","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Burnaston plant in south Derbyshire is one of nine the Japanese car giant has in the UK. Photograph: Matt CardyGetty ImagesToyota has said that production at its UK factories would be disrupted for weeks or maybe months if Theresa May failed to strike a Brexit deal.The Japanese car manufacturer is the latest in a list of foreign car companies to say there could be temporary stoppages and maybe even job losses if there are checks at Dover and Calais as a result of no deal.“My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,” Marvin Cooke, the managing director at the firm’s plant in Burnaston, near Derby, told the BBC.Asked how long the production stoppages would last, he said: “We can’t predict – it could be hours, days, weeks – even months.”His warning follows statements by Jaguar Land Rover and BMW over the consequences of no deal for the British car manufacturing business, which employs more than 186,000 people directly and more than 856,000 indirectly.Greg Clark, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the Chequers Brexit proposal was “a very practical set of proposals precisely calibrated to avoid those checks”.He said he disagreed with the assessment that the EU had rejected Chequers and said there would be a heavy toll to pay across the EU with car manufacturers if a deal was not struck.But he admitted that Britain would lose its potential as one of the world’s leaders in car innovation if there was no deal. “To see that slip through our fingers is something that we would regret for ever,” he said.The Burnaston plant in south Derbyshire is one of nine the Japanese car giant has in the UK and is the home of the Toyota Auris and the Avensis. Toyota has plans to take on 400 new staff as part of a £250 million investment in a new production line for an updated Corolla.It produces cars worth £12 million a day with components arriving every 37 minutes as part of the “just-in-time” production process, which means car manufacturers do not store parts in on-site warehouses.Instead its factories rely on smooth delivery of parts from within the UK and especially Europe, from where 1,000 lorries a day cross the channel with parts for car manufacturers in Oxford, the Midlands, the north and the north-east.Mr Cooke said Toyota was looking at its options for storage but said checks and delays would add costs to the bottom line permanently.“It would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly, that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs.”Last week Honda said it would look to stockpile some components as a contingency. Earlier this month JLR announced that 2,000 staff would move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant just hours after it was accused of “scaremongering” by a hard Brexiter MP.BMW announced it was planning to shut its Oxfordshire plant for a month to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. –  Service"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3646313.1538241075!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister blames 17 month delay in department s move on office of public works","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Health’s new headquarters lay empty for 17 months at a cost to the State of €15.8 million, a report by the Comptroller \u0026 Auditor General has found.Minister for Health Simon Harris has defended his department after a report found its new headquarters lay empty for 17 months at a cost to the State of €15.8 million.He also appeared to lay the blame at the door of the Office of Public Works, which he said is “solely responsible” for the provision of accommodation for Government departments.The Department of Health moved into its new offices on Lower Baggot Street, Dublin, “at the earliest opportunity” once the accommodation was ready, Mr Harris said.He was responding to a report from Comptroller and Auditor General Seamus McCarthy, which said the move to the building, which is owned by Larry Goodman, was delayed in part because of protracted disagreements over its internal layout.Mr Harris said four government departments which would be using the building - the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, part of the Department of Finance, and part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and his department.The OPW had sole responsibility for procurement, the entering into tenders and leases, and the provision of state accommodation, he said.“I think it is very frustrating that such a large sum of money was spent on a building when it was empty but obviously the OPW has responsibility for tendering and procurement and what I would expect is that the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) would examine this chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report.”The report said Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform, had agreed on a floor plan by March 2017 but that the departments of Health and Children were involved with the OPW in extensive negotiation over the fit out of the premises.One of the issues that arose had to do with the plan for open plan accommodation for assistant principal officers, who were used to having their own offices in Hawkins House, the building they were moving from.Asked about this Mr Harris said there is always concern when an organisation was moving from one office to another and you had to make sure that you had adequate accommodation for staff.He told The  he “looked forward” to the OPW answering questions before the PAC as the accounting officers for the money involved, and he was sure they would do that.He welcomed the fact that matters such as this were subjected to scrutiny but certainly neither his department nor he as minister had any role in the legal contracts and tendering process and that was as it should be.The OPW has said the leasing of the building is the largest such deal it has secured in recent years and was achieved at “an extremely competitive rent” of €49.85 per square foot.The fit out of any large scale commercial building is a complex process and a period of nine to 10 months would not be unusual for a building of the size of the Miesian Plaza.However, it said, there was no doubt but that the move presented “significant challenges” for both the departments of Health and Children, as well as the OPW."},{"url":null,"title":"i tried to yell for help brett kavanaugh accuser gives evidence","story":"  September 27, 2018Supreme Court nominee follows his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, before US Senate   September 27, 2018Drama in Washington as Christine Blasey Ford and supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testify   September 27, 2018Supreme court nominee vehemently denies accusations by Christine Blasey Ford   September 28, 2018Christine Blasey Ford and supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testify in Washington "},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

During the weekend they are all full of visitors,” he said. Indonesia tsunami in pictures: Big waves leave Sulawesi coastline in ruinsThe Head of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), Willem Rampangilei, told reporters in Sulawesi late on Saturday the death toll from Palu had reached 420 people, according to news website Kompas.It\u0027s estimated that 10,000 refugees are scattered in 50 points in Palu city, he was quoted by Kompas as saying. We are having difficulty deploying heavy equipment to find victims under the rubble of buildings because many of the roads leading to Palu city are damaged.Amateur video footage showed trees, buildings and a communications tower being swept through a rural landscape. The landslide was caused by liquification of the soil, according BNPB\u0027s Nugroho.In a terrible twist of fate, an estimated 1,000 people, many of whom remain unaccounted for, had arrived to attend a cultural festival, which was due to be inaugurated on the beachfront by the tourism minister.“About 250 local security personnel were on standby..and the beach was already full with festival-goers when the earthquake struck. People tried to run away from the beach, but not so many survived. They were caught by the water,” said Mr Sutopo. Sulawesi was hit by several earthquakes on Friday, including one of a 6.1 magnitude earlier in the day. According to the US Geological Survey, the strongest of 7.5 struck at a depth of 10km, 56km northeast of the coastal town of Donggala. Initial reports suggest it triggered an underwater avalanche that caused the tsunami.   Indonesian earthquake and tsunamiThe Red Cross said staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.We\u0027re now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than 300,000 people living there, Red Cross said in a statement.This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.One eyewitness called Adam told the Kompas website that people had panicked and tried to flee after the first earthquake hit.“After that, we saw water suddenly crashing, and finally there was a big panic. Not having time to escape, there was a bigger earthquake, and suddenly the water rose, he said.Shocking images of destruction in Palu emerged quickly on social media, showing split roads, collapsed homes, mosques and supermarkets which had been crowded with shoppers before disaster struck. The most tragic pictures revealed partially covered bodies, and the silhouette of a man carrying a dead child through the wreckage.

As he ascended, Mr Mafella tried to contact air traffic control and was perplexed to receive no answer from Mr Agung. From the air, he noticed unusual waves rolling into Palu, but it was only later that he discovered he had made a dramatic take-off at the start of an earthquake. Indonesian soldiers load emergency supplies into a Hercules military plane before heading to Palu at Halim Perdanakusuma military base in JakartaPalu\u0027s airport halted operations for 24 hours due to earthquake damage, according to AirNav, which oversees airline traffic in Indonesia.Mirza Arisam, a resident of Kendari, the capital of neighboring Southeast Sulawesi, said his uncle and his family of five, including three children, were on holiday in Palu and he has been unable to contact them since the tsunami hit.In Palu\u0027s Roa-Roa Hotel, which was completely flattened by the quake, many people were still missing.Communication is cut off.

While he was formulating a plan, he heard a voice calling out to him: “Commander, help me, help me!”A young boy of about ten years old was crying to him from the roof of a hut. The child told him he had been playing on the beach with his friends when the tsunami approached.“Suddenly a big wave came in our direction. So I ran away, but I was thrown onto that roof. I tried to shout for help, but there was no one yesterday. I tried to call my friends too, but no one answered me,” the boy said.The officer fears that many street vendors, attracted by the festival, would have been swept out to sea, as well as children, especially girls, who had come to perform dances.President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra in western Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.Please review our commenting policyElon Musk steps down as Tesla chairman following deal with US regulatorsNew high-end venue in London designed for magicians with just 90 seatsStrictly Come Dancing 2018, week 2 live: Ashley Roberts notches highest score of series - but will Anton Du Beke make his earliest exit ever?Help to Buy scheme is not working as it should, housing minister admitsSuper radar planned for Kent coastline to detect illegal migrants\u0026#39My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone\u0026#39North Korea refuses to denucleariseJapan pummeled by typhoon, at least 17 injuredForeign buyers to be targeted by stamp duty hike, Theresa May announcesTory fury as party faces huge fine for \u0026#39disgraceful\u0026#39 data breachUK sending 800 troops to Arctic in warning shot to RussiaComment: The time has come for a polite rebellion by pragmatic Conservatives - back a new referendum\u0026#39We need a more robust approach\u0026#39: David Davis unleashes criticism of Brexit negotiationsComment: Business needs an alternative to the timid, relentlessly wrong CBILabour Mps hit out at \u0026#39purge\u0026#39 after former shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, loses confidence voteParliament\u0026#39s statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by \u0026#39rewriting history\u0026#39 rowNow the vegan diet is taking over the British vegetable patchHarvard introduces course on sleep for all new undergraduatesComment: Time\u0026#39s up, Mrs May.

Extra officers are likely to be drafted in to meet the deadline.They could just about drop everything else they\u0027re doing, every other background check for generals to get the next star, and cabinet secretaries and US attorneys, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. If they want to put 500 agents on this tomorrow they could do that.One of their first tasks will be speaking to possible corroborating witnesses. Mark Judge, Mr Kavanaugh’s friend, was said by Prof Ford to be in the room when the then 17-year-old Mr Kavanaugh allegedly hustled her into a bedroom, closed the door, pinned her to the bed and attempted to rip off her clothes.Christine Blasey Ford, preparing to testify before the Senate judiciary committee on ThursMr Judge, who has been hiding out at a beach house in Delaware for the past week, declined to speak at Thursday’s Senate hearing, but has said he is willing to speak to the FBI.He denies all knowledge of the attack recalled by Prof Ford, saying her accusations are “bizarre” and politically-motivated, adding: “It’s no situation I recall ever being in.”Prof Ford told the committee that she crossed paths with Mr Judge at a Safeway supermarket a few weeks after the attack, and that he looked ashen upon seeing her. The FBI could ask Safeway for their employment records, in an attempt to narrow down the time frame of the attack, Prof Ford being unable to recall the exact date that summer.Investigators are also likely to speak in the coming days to Leland Keyser and P.J. Smyth, high school friends who Prof Ford said were at the party. Both have said they do not remember being at any such party, but are willing to cooperate.The FBI cannot compel anyone to speak to them, or obtain search warrants, unlike in a criminal investigation.Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, voted with a caveat Another team will likely try to determine the house at which the party took place, scouring housing records to find where friends of Prof Ford and Mr Kavanaugh lived at the time, and searching for a property that fits her description of having a bathroom upstairs, with a narrow staircase and a bedroom opposite the bathroom.And Prof Ford’s account is not the only one being investigated by the FBI, a source close to the inquiry told the New York Times.Deborah Ramirez, in an interview with The New Yorker, alleged that Mr Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a night of drinking when they were both students at Yale. Agents are now expected to seek interviews with his university friends, roommates and fraternity brothers about his drinking habits at Yale, and his behaviour at parties in Lawrance Hall, where he lived that year and where Ms Ramirez claimed the episode occurred.Another woman, Julie Swetnick, on Wednesday became the third woman to accuse Mr Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, although it was not clear whether her claims were also being investigated.Their report, known as a 302 after the number of the form that agents fill out, will likely be dry and factual.“They will report what the results are - whether they are exculpatory or not,” said Robert Cromwell, a former agent who oversaw these types of investigations. “The results will stand on their own.”Brett Kavanaugh was criticised for being angry while testifying to the committee on ThursdayFor Prof Ford’s supporters and the Democratic party, it is an essential document, to guarantee the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.But for Mr Kavanaugh’s die-hard defenders, such as South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, it’s a time-wasting distraction.“You can have the FBI, the CIA, and the foreign legion,” he said. “And they’re not going to tell us more than we already know.”Essentially because Jeff Flake, a Republican senator from Arizona, changed his mind at the last minute and said he would only vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh if the FBI investigated first. The idea was floated in the Senate committee hearing by Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware.“I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “falling apart” amid entrenched partisan gridlock.Their reluctance is all due to timing. The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush’s personal secretary.There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.It\u0027s still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.Key to Mr Kavanaugh’s future are the votes of Mr Flake, plus two undecided Republican women - Susan Collins, for Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Mr Flake held out the possibility of rejecting him for the role.“I’m a conservative. He’s a conservative,” he said. “I plan to support him unless they turn up something - and they might.”And adding to the complexity, two Democrats in heavily-Republican states – Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia – are both up for re-election this year, and are reportedly undecided about Mr Kavanaugh.Then the process starts again. Waiting in the wings are believed to be Amy Coney Barrett, Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman, chosen from a list of 25 judges selected by the conservative Federalist Society.But that does mean that Mr Trump will not get his first choice of Supreme Court justice in time for the midterms – and you can bet he will use that to galvanise his base, urging his supporters to vote and ensure that he has sympathetic Republicans in Congress.A surge in turnout might be a problem for Democrats.Elon Musk steps down as Tesla chairman following deal with US regulatorsIndonesia tsunami: Thousands feared dead after 10-foot-high waves slam into two cities on SulawesiNew high-end venue in London designed for magicians with just 90 seatsStrictly Come Dancing 2018, week 2 live: Ashley Roberts notches highest score of series - but will Anton Du Beke make his earliest exit ever?Help to Buy scheme is not working as it should, housing minister admitsSuper radar planned for Kent coastline to detect illegal migrants\u0026#39My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone\u0026#39North Korea refuses to denucleariseJapan pummeled by typhoon, at least 17 injuredForeign buyers to be targeted by stamp duty hike, Theresa May announcesTory fury as party faces huge fine for \u0026#39disgraceful\u0026#39 data breachUK sending 800 troops to Arctic in warning shot to RussiaComment: The time has come for a polite rebellion by pragmatic Conservatives - back a new referendum\u0026#39We need a more robust approach\u0026#39: David Davis unleashes criticism of Brexit negotiationsComment: Business needs an alternative to the timid, relentlessly wrong CBILabour Mps hit out at \u0026#39purge\u0026#39 after former shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, loses confidence voteParliament\u0026#39s statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by \u0026#39rewriting history\u0026#39 rowNow the vegan diet is taking over the British vegetable patchHarvard introduces course on sleep for all new undergraduatesComment: Time\u0026#39s up, Mrs May.

Not directly over the landing spot, but off to one side so I can get a good look at where I want to go in a safe manner, but also not so far away that I can see the water.I then move sideways in a controlled manner, hover over my assigned landing spot and make a steady descent to the deck before applying the brakes.

My girlfriend thought she was helping out.”“It was picked up by a runner and we verified there were clearly misdemeanours going on. It was a genuine rule that was broken and we had to reshoot the end.”“They are rock and rollers and they live on the edge as they did in the 80s.

They proved so popular, it was hard to take them down. Women of all shapes and sizes grinned from the walls on their bikes: Muslim women with headscarves tucked under helmets, mothers with children strapped on\u0026nbspchild seats. Most were wearing wet-weather gear. This is Glasgow, after all.“So many people engaged with these portraits,” says Shgufta Anwar, a development officer for Bike for Good, a social enterprise that gets people cycling. “I think they were so popular because we’re trying to normalise women on bikes in the area and it isn’t the norm, at the moment.”Anwar runs many of the programmes out of Bike For Good’s community hub,\u0026nbspwhich opened in May last year\u0026nbspon Victoria Road on Glasgow’s Southside. The organisation was founded by Greg Kinsman-Chauvet after he learned to ride a bike\u0026nbspaged\u0026nbsp30 and found it to be a life-changing experience. He liked cycling so much he moved to Glasgow, sold his car and quit his job to volunteer.The charity arm of Bike for Good started with a small stall in Barras Market in July 2010, teaching people the mechanics of the bike and how to cycle safely. It has since expanded to include a for-profit social enterprise that makes money refurbishing bikes and selling them on. Anything that can’t be used is stripped and sold on as parts, to stop as many bikes and parts as possible from going to landfill.\u0026nbspBike for Good now employs more than 50 people. It is one of several cycling organisations in Glasgow working to meet the Scottish government’s target: for bikes to be used for 10 per cent of journeys made by\u0026nbsp2020, up from the current figure of 2 per cent. (As things are, hitting that target will take 350 years.)But there are positive signs on the front line. The Southside branch of Bike for Good is already outgrowing its premises and looking to relocate to somewhere larger. The main reason it needs more space? More bikes. For most, the key barrier to cycling is not owning a bicycle.\u0026nbspNextbike, a rental city bike scheme, offers over 500 bikes at 63 stations across the city for an annual fee of £60. This is too pricey for many. So Bike for Good joined with other cycling organisations in the city to offer loan bikes for £3 to refugees and other communities on Southside. It tops up the Nextbike supply with its own refurbished loan bikes, which have grown in number from 10 to more than 40.“For some people £60 is nothing, but for some people £60 is everything,” says Anwar. Then there are other barriers. Some people live or work far from the bike stations, others don’t have a smartphone to make the rental or good enough English to understand the process. Bike for Good worked with the other cycle groups to find interpreters to speak to potential cyclists. They welcome newcomers into the Southside hub to hire the bikes, rather than forcing people to sign up\u0026nbspon the phone. The work is ongoing. In its first phase of the project, surveys showed some people without financial barriers were taking the cheaper bikes. Now they are looking at targeting specific groups.\u0026nbsp“We’re also running training because a lot of people lack confidence on the roads,” says Anwar.\u0026nbsp“It’s not just, ‘Here’s a bike, off you go’, it’s support for them as well.”Govanhill is the most erse neighbourhood of Scotland, with more than 50 languages spoken across just 13 housing blocks. It is also the focus of the South City Way, a £6.5m\u0026nbspinvestment by the Scottish government into improved cycle paths to connect different parts of the city and promote cycling as an environmentally friendly, healthy activity. Anwar and the Bike for Good team now have a big job on their hands: to encourage the erse communities of Govanhill to believe that cycling is for them.“One particular culture barrier we had was clothing. People don’t want to wear Lycra, they want to be able to cycle in whatever they wear,” says\u0026nbspAnwar. Most of the Bike for Good fleet are step-through bikes with a low bar. “The ladies love these bikes, particularly for the Muslim and Asian communities because they’re wearing something a bit looser and longer on their figure.”Uber to shift focus to electric bikes and scooters for short tripsHow e-bikes make you feel like you\u0027re incredibly good at cyclingLack of bike lanes \u0027putting off more than half of potential cyclists\u0027Pedal Pathways, Bike for Good’s cycling group aimed at women, has now worked with more than\u0026nbsp200 women from across Glasgow. Sixty per cent of those surveyed said their health and wellbeing had improved thanks to the sessions, which can include yoga, bike maintenance, healthy food and, of course,\u0026nbspa bike ride.\u0026nbsp“The majority of people that come into us with barriers are ladies,” Anwar says. “Some of them are estranged, some of them are not talking to anyone other than their family members, or they’re migrants, they might have been through horrific experiences. The social aspect is really important.”For some of these communities, cycling is something people do if they can’t drive, Anwar says. “People say, ‘Now we have cars, why would you cycle?’” she says. “So you have to get them to think of the health aspect and the environment aspect. It’s about getting people to realise that at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what you look like, you’re all the same underneath and you’re there for a common purpose, which is to ride a bike.”bike for goodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Therefore, we intend to vote against Unilever’s proposed resolution.”Investors should not despair – Unilever can still stay in the FTSE 100Unilever hikes idend and announces €6bn share buy-backLondon may be losing Unilever’s HQ but it must not lose its sharesUnilever, which has been based in Britain for almost a century, reviewed its dual-headed corporate structure in the aftermath of an attempted $143bn takeover from Kraft Heinz last year, as Dutch laws offer more comprehensive protections against hostile takeovers. Bosses have since tried to convince investors that their proposed Dutch incorporation will “create a simpler, more agile and more focused company”.Unilever needs at least 75 per cent of votes of London-listed shareholders in order to get the green light for an exodus from the capital.Mr Sadan added: “As a supportive shareholder in Unilever for more than 25 years, we have engaged with the company on a number of issues including its decision to unify its corporate structure. \u0026nbspWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit from Unilever’s continued success.”LGIM’s decision to vote against the relocation plans of the UK’s third largest company mirrors the opposition expressed by other shareholders, including Brewin Dolphin, Lindsell Train and Columbia Threadneedle.Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: “We aren’t convinced that the move will realise tangible benefits for shareholders and plan to vote against.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

You can only imagine the producers’ faces as they watched Craig and co annihilate one dance after the other, failing to find anything to get excited about.\u0026nbspIt picked up after the first few numbers though, and Danny, Faye, Joe and Ashley all got rave reviews. They loved Kate’s sultry tango with Aljaz too.\u0026nbspThe relief got to Tess and she started laughing uncontrollably at one of Claudia’s only mildly amusing jokes, which was a bit awkward. Oh and Rob Beckett read out the Ts and Cs while Bruno managed another reference to Bodyguard. (When will he move onto Killing Eve like the rest of us? Maybe Halloween week?).Here’s what everyone is talking about as they await tomorrow night’s results…Joe Sugg is really having a moment. Sure, he’s been a YouTube sensation for some time, but now the mainstream are falling in love with him too. Everyone adores him, even though he’s dancing to Cotton Eye Joe, dressed a roof thatcher – superstardom beckons.His jive really hit the spot tonight, but Seann and Katya’s failed to impress. They weren’t in time to the music and panic set in. It didn’t help that they danced to Elton John’s I’m Still Standing, the music used for Jill Halfpenny’s iconic glitterball-clinching routine in series two, which is still being talked about more than a decade later. Surely Katya should have known better. Still, the judging gave Shirley and Seann a chance to make up, as she now likes his hair. Which is a relief for all of us.But Danny is hot on their heels. Faye and Giovanni’s Viennese Waltz will have alienated viewers who like a traditional approach – it was really an Argentine tango piece of storytelling trapped within a waltz. Of course it was beautifully executed though, and the judges loved it. Ashley’s silver tassled cha cha to Boogie Wonderland was an instant crowd-pleaser and allowed her to claim the top spot on the leaderboard, relegating Faye to number two. But don’t make the mistake of thinking this is a two-horse race – Danny is absolutely killing it. He’s feeling all those rehearsals in his feet and legs, but out on the dance floor he looks fabulous. One to watch.Vicky Gill and her team do an incredible job in the Strictly costume department, but every serues nightmares still happen. Janette Manrara is a salsa specialist and Dr Ranj is a brilliant student, so their routine should have been a highlight. But disaster struck when part of Janette’s dress got stuck on the heel of her shoe, restricting her movement for a good 20 seconds. Dr Ranj must have been secretly horrified but, props to him, you couldn’t see it on his face. He did a brilliant job, to much acclaim from the judges, but you can’t help feeling it could have been better. Shame.Janette Manrara\u0027s dress got stuck on the heel of her shoe as she danced with Dr Ranj Singh. (PA)Lauren has spoken very openly about two things so far this series. One: how she wants to inspire other girls with disabilities to feel that they can dance. Two: that she’s a competitive athlete by trade and wants to win. It was probably a heady mix of these two considerations that made her agree to sit on AJ’s shoulders during their Charleston and then fall face forward towards the floor with only one hand to catch herself. It really was a wow moment. If only the rest of the routine had been as exhilarating…Susannah and Anton finished at the bottom of the leaderboard, with Graeme and Oti, Seann and Katya and Katie and Gorka just above them. Tomorrow night we’ll face the first dance-off of the series (which seemed to come as a shock to Dr Ranj, like a child discovering Santa Claus isn’t real) and two couples will be fighting to make it through to Movie Week next time. Anton has his own very loyal army of fans, so don’t expect to see him waving goodbye tomorrow. It’s the couples in that dangerous mid-leaderboard position that should be worried. Vick and Graziano, I’m looking at you.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But NOA\u0027s pitch is that it\u0027s not a competition at all, and that audio can be about showing off some of the best traditional journalism in an entirely new setting.While audio is perhaps the oldest of all forms of media, the ways it is being delivered to people isn\u0027t at all. The advent of Amazon\u0027s Alexa, for instance, heralded an entirely new form of listening within the home, favouring on-demand cuts of information that can be requested by shouting while doing the washing up traditional radio still exists but it is increasingly being delivered over the internet when people ask, rather than as traditional broadcast.And the growth of ways to listen has come with an expansion of the listening public, too. With on-demand audio, people have come to see (or hear) that there are various times of the day that go largely unfilled, and it\u0027s apps like NOA – as well as other major audio companies like Audible – that are rushing into stop them being so silent.Amazon Alexa will now listen for strangers in your houseNOA works in a relatively simple way: its team take the best of their partners\u0027 written content, have a narrator record it, and push it out into the world. Its audience can then listen however and whenever they want, simply by opening up the app on their phone or asking Alexa to do it for them.The great thing about it is the time you have each day to consume visual content is limited, says Gareth Hickey, co-founder and CEO at NOA. You might take a quick look at a screen in the morning, and an hour or two in the evening. And that time can be filled up not just with news or other media like on demand television and Netflix, but also social media, emails and WhatsApp.Audio, however, doesn\u0027t have to compete: it can be done while driving, walking, exercising or doing something else entirely, and so can be a complement rather than distraction.About half of NOA\u0027s consumption comes between 7am and 9am. That gap in the day there just gets a lot of traffic – it\u0027s people that are usually commuting.There are of course many companies vying for that time too, many of them new. Everything from the shortest podcast to the longest of Audible\u0027s audiobook is intended to take on that market.But there is an awful lot of that time, too, and it is often spent doing a variety of different things. That means that companies like NOA seeing themselves as complementing podcasts rather than challenging them.That\u0027s useful become some companies like the New York Times have invested heavily in podcasts.They try much own that experience, and they\u0027re doing a great job with that. They\u0027re putting a huge amount of thought and time into getting that right.Instead, NOA focuses on the traditional articles that continue to do so well for those publishers. It is not about the kind of lengthier chats that often make up the meat of podcasts, but rather taking the quality content that news organisations are already producing it and recording it so people can listen to it another way.The style of content that we tend to lean more and more towards is the opinion, analysis, features, he says. The kind of articles that you might come across on a busy Monday afternoon and might not have the time to read.When people do come to those articles, they tend to spend a decent amount of time: about 85 per cent of people coming to an article will finish it, and they\u0027ll stay for an average of four-and-a-half minutes.NOA, of course, has some of the same struggles as every other news publisher. One of them is ensuring that people feel they can make their way through the vast amount of information that\u0027s out there in a way that\u0027s comprehensive and meaningful – without feeling completely overwhelming.One of the things we\u0027re moving towards has been an attempt to bring finish-ability to news topics, he says. It\u0027s all very well reading one piece about Brexit or business or whatever else, but with those huge issues it cane difficult to know where to start or where to end.One approach that NOA has been taking is to gather those topics up into playlists. One about electric cars, for instance, might include a more general overview on the industry, a e into the cobalt shortage that is threatening the batteries that power them, and a look at the latest scandal Tesla and Elon Musk have become embroiled in.It all helps to make people feel like it\u0027s possible to reach the end of the news, even if it\u0027s just to find that some more news has happened. When there is such an often overwhelming amount of stories – and stories about those stories – NOA like other more traditional publishers in seeking ways to cut through the noise.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They were sent back over a distance of around 180 million miles.They come after the space agency successfully landed two rovers on the asteroid, dropping them from a spacecraft floating just above the surface.The rovers dropped down onto the asteroid by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft are the first mobile exploration robots ever to land on an asteroid\u0027s surface. The images they are sending back are the first time that anything has ever autonomously moved and taken pictures themselves on asteroid, too.One of the pictures includes the shadow of the antenna and pin of the rover itself.​ The pin – which is the long line that can be seen sticking out of the rover – helps increase friction when they engage in the hops that they use to jump around the surface, among other purposes.Jaxa, the Japanese space agency, says that both of the rovers are in good condition and are transmitting images and data. The pictures they are sending back have confirmed that they are moving themselves around the asteroid\u0027s surface.The rovers will spend their time exploring the planet\u0027s surface by being joined by yet another visitor,\u0026nbspcalled Mascot, built by scientists in Germany and France, that will further explore the surface.The new pictures are the second batch to be sent down by the\u0026nbspHayabusa-2 spacecraft. The first were taken as the two rovers tumbled to the surface, and show their whirling motion as they fall.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain’s ‘managed capitulation’The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to allow the UK to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, Canada-style\u0026nbsptrade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a Norway-style EEA deal\u0026nbsp– effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexity people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.”The Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal.

There is a need to get beyond Brexit and focus very hard between now and the end of the parliament on the domestic agenda.“It seems odd to say it now, but the next election will not be decided on Brexit. People will be looking at other things, and it’s absolutely the case that a Conservative offering needs to say how a competitive, enterprise economy can give people more choice, can spread prosperity, instead of state controlled centralised economics.“It’s an eternal argument, and Labour this past week has set out a story which is to the left of where it has been for a long time. We have to have that argument with Labour – and not continue to have arguments about Brexit with ourselves.”In Liverpool, Mr Corbyn struck out at “greed is good” capitalism, as he branded his party’s left-wing agenda the “new common sense” to overturn decades of economic orthodoxy.We have to have that argument with Labour – and not continue to have arguments about Brexit with ourselvesPolicies included nationalisation, collective pay bargaining, a renters union for people struggling against rising costs, compulsory share ownership for workers and an expansion in free childcare.\u0026nbspAsked whether it was going to be possible for the Tories to match this\u0026nbspin Birmingham, Mr Green said: “I’m sure it will be the first step this week, it needs to be possible. But then it needs to be this week and every week until 2022.“Whatever the big announcements are, I hope they will all be about how we will help people in their daily lives – that’s what people want to hear – it’s the domestic agenda, stupid.”One cabinet minister\u0026nbspThe Independent spoke to backed the need for a fresh approach and said the party must also underline its achievements to date, adding: “We have lifted the economy out from recession and have employment at record levels, we have created opportunities for people to get on the housing ladder.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Royal Navy Commander, Nathan Gray lands his F-35B onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.Headteachers from across England and Wales hold signs in Parliament Square, London, as they prepare to march on Downing Street to demand extra money for schoolsFormer leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson (C) arrives at the Old Bailey Courthouse in London, Britain, 27 September 2018.

In truth, all the policies that he is advocating have been tried somewhere in the world, and indeed here, and they have all failed.”In a sign of the growing anger against the hard Brexiteers, the minister added: “His is a message of populists from the left and the right who believe in closed economies and would ultimately turn inwards. And that isn’t where a bright future lies for the UK.”Tories take aim at May ahead of party conference: ‘Stuck in the past’Everything you need to know about the Conservative Party ConferenceMay told to end austerity by senior Conservative on eve of conferenceIf May offered a final say on Brexit, she would win another electionGeorge Freeman, former head of Ms May’s policy board, is among those attempting to make the Conservatives realise the danger the party is in.The MP for Mid Norfolk, who runs the annual Big Tent Ideas Festival to drum up new thinking, said: “’All of us on the centre right need to wake up and smell the coffee.“We are living through a 1975, 1945 or 1905 moment, when an old order passes and a new order emerges. The crash, QE inflation and asset boom, public sector austerity and Brexit mean the old political rules no longer apply. \u0026nbsp“Unless we recognise and respect the very real grievances Corbyn is tapping into and set out bold Conservative solutions, the tide will continue to turn against us.”Many Tories appear to be impressed by the way\u0026nbspLabour has packaged its policy agenda, taking what they\u0026nbspbelieve\u0026nbspto be outdated socialist ideas and making them appear relevant in the modern world.\u0026nbspMr Freeman said: “This week Labour moved dangerously close to looking\u0026nbsplike a credible government-in-waiting. While their policies of renationalisation, raids on company shareholder registers and massive extra debt and tax would be disastrous, they have successfully recognised the changed mood of the country.“We urgently need to set out the Conservative alternative.”The Independent spoke to two other cabinet ministers who backed Mr Freeman’s warning about the need for an overhaul of the party’s policy agenda and agreed that the Corbyn threat is now tangible.Corbyn offers Brexit truce with May if her final deal is ‘sensible’Will Tanner was one of Ms May’s top aides until he left No 10 to set up and run the free-market think tank Onward, which enjoys the ear of senior Tory figures.He said he had been surprised\u0026nbspby the coherence of the Labour leader’s overall message in Liverpool, adding: “It felt like Jeremy Corbyn has actually managed to not only develop a relatively coherent agenda, but also found a language and narrative in which to cloak it, which softens lots of the edges that people are most worried about.“That potentially makes it far more popular than it might otherwise be in terms of talking about things in ways that we know resonate with voters.”He pointed as an example of his analysis to shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s plan to enforce “inclusive share ownership funds” for workers, which he argued was a repackaging of the old socialist idea of “requisitioning profits”.But he said the Conservative Party faced major challenges in attempting to counter the Corbyn push.\u0026nbspKeir Starmer says there should be a general election if Theresa May’s deal is voted down“The question at the moment is one of unity,” he said.“There are multiple strands of thinking going on within Conservatism right now and there isn’t the coherence within the Conservative Party that we saw in Labour’s message.“The danger is that ergent views of what Conservatism stands for muddies the message, dilutes the brand and therefore becomes much less attractive to people.”But there was little real hope from MPs that much would be done during the conference starting on Sunday.Former minister and prominent Tory thinker Nick Boles MP said: “We clearly do have a job to do, but it won’t happen next week. We need to get Brexit out of the way first.”Another serving minister said it was “inevitable” that the entire conference would be “utterly consumed with Brexit”.Meanwhile, another prominent backbencher said: “There might be interesting conversations going on in rooms here and there, but the overall context and unavoidable message will be about Brexit. Boris Johnson will see to that.”Talks of an imminent challenge to the prime minister have receded in recent weeks, with a critical European summit following with days of the Conservative conference.But Ms May’s days are still seen as numbered, with one MP from the moderate centre of the parliamentary party echoing comments made by several that, “yes, of course we need a totally new policy platform, but the idea it will emerge this week is a bit too hopeful.“Frankly we need a change in leader as well. To have any chance of injecting some life into our policy platform we need a new leader.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

public to decide what they want us to do next\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsHeidi Allen has become the latest Conservative MP to back a Final Say Brexit referendum, arguing there is now “no alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

Therefore, we intend to vote against Unilever’s proposed resolution.”Investors should not despair – Unilever can still stay in the FTSE 100Unilever hikes idend and announces €6bn share buy-backLondon may be losing Unilever’s HQ but it must not lose its sharesUnilever, which has been based in Britain for almost a century, reviewed its dual-headed corporate structure in the aftermath of an attempted $143bn takeover from Kraft Heinz last year, as Dutch laws offer more comprehensive protections against hostile takeovers. Bosses have since tried to convince investors that their proposed Dutch incorporation will “create a simpler, more agile and more focused company”.Unilever needs at least 75 per cent of votes of London-listed shareholders in order to get the green light for an exodus from the capital.Mr Sadan added: “As a supportive shareholder in Unilever for more than 25 years, we have engaged with the company on a number of issues including its decision to unify its corporate structure. \u0026nbspWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit from Unilever’s continued success.”LGIM’s decision to vote against the relocation plans of the UK’s third largest company mirrors the opposition expressed by other shareholders, including Brewin Dolphin, Lindsell Train and Columbia Threadneedle.Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: “We aren’t convinced that the move will realise tangible benefits for shareholders and plan to vote against.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

MERKEL ON BRINK: Chancellor under pressure from business leaders                Merkel faces calls or resignation but she still has one EU fanMrs Merkel should draw the consequences of the mistakes made by her, especially in the asylum policy, and the resulting poor poll numbers.This would be an opportunity to re-integrate the party\u0027s conservative and pro-business wing.But Ralph Brinkhaus, the head of the CDU and Christian Social Union (CSU) in the German parliament, threw his weight behind Mrs Merkel.He said: I assume that she will compete, and I would endorse that, because a head of government also needs the backing of the party.Angela Merkel is under growing pressure to quit as CDU leader (Image: EPA)Mr Brinkhaus replaced Volker Kauder, a long-standing ally of Angela Merkel, in the post earlier this week after a party vote.The shock poll dealt a further blow to the Chancellor\u0027s waning authority, as she struggles to unite Germany\u0027s coalition.Social Democratic politician Thomas Oppermann said the move was an uprising against Merkel.Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, from Germany\u0027s Free Democratic Party, said it was the beginning of the end of the grand coalition.                German leader Angela Merkel issues apology as coalition hit by crisis                Merkel DEFEATED: German chancellor hit by HUGE UPRISING The German Chancellor\u0027s approval ratings have plunged in recent months (Image: )Daniel Guenther, the premier of northern state Schleswig Holstein, added: The vote shows a desire for renewal.There was clearly a certain discontent over national politics.And a CDU adviser said: Kauder was the first domino to fall, but there might well be more.

that little Amy is clever because she knows all the answers.What he doesn’t realise is that Amy does her homework with her family every night.American comedian Rob Delaney ignited a lively debate when he tweeted: “Why do they give seven-year-olds so much homework in the UK and how do I stop this?I want my kid frolicking and drawing and playing football.”Fellow celebrities Gary Lineker and Jason Manford agreed.Piers Morgan disagreed, calling the arguments “lazy parenting”.I have to disagree too with Mr Delaney and his supporters.Homework is essential for a child’s education because revisiting the day’s learning is what helps to make it stick.So Catastrophe star Rob and Gary Lineker are wrong in attacking compulsory home-work in primary schools.Sure, you’ll get the odd exceptionally bright pupil who will excel just through what she learns at school, despite not having that support at home.But this is very rare.Teaching is not just the teacher’s job.It takes a village to raise a child.Children learn all the time and the environment surrounding them determines how much they learn.Genes play a part in how clever a child is, but how hard they work also matters.Work hard and you’ll learn lots.Work less and you’ll learn less.Don’t make the mistake of thinking homework is for a child to do on their own.When parents use homework to bond and learn together with their child, the child understands that Mum and Dad value learning.And because a child wants to please their parents, the child’s interest in their home-work will grow, year on year.These children can see the benefit of homework and will enjoy doing it because it makes them feel better about themselves.Everyone loves to feel successful.Ten years ago, author Malcolm Gladwell introduced the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at about 8pm.That’s nearly five hours of free time.Are they really spending it playing hockey or going to Brownies?I doubt it.Half an hour of homework in five hours of spare time is a drop in the ocean, leaving lots of time for other things.The real worry for parents should be how much time children are spending on social media — something that is so very dangerous and takes up hours of their time, unlike homework.Katharine Birbalsingh is head of Michaela Community School, North London, and has been dubbed the country’s “strictest head teacher”.She introduced an ultra-disciplined approach to

Thick as he is, ­Corbyn sees no contradiction.Then it was on to Jezza curing all our ills with freebies galore and mass job creation, all presumably funded by the same tax on the rich. Since Labour aides now privately admit their 2017 manesto secretly covered up a £1TRILLION bill, Corbyn’s assurances aren’t worth the autocue they are written on.This smug, cocky Labour conference is an annual reminder of just what a dishonest rabble they now are.

Frontbencher Richard Burgon stood and applauded.

Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­-Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield.Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable.

That’s more than double what we’d normally receive, he says.It’s not just maggots in bins, they’re dropping from the ceiling in homes and shops.”And Peter says we are ALL responsible for the maggot population explosion.“Britain’s hot summer has meant there was a healthy fly count. We’ve all been outside in the garden or parks for picnics, he tells Sun Online.“When food gets left in the heat it rots quicker as bacteria forms much faster in warm temperatures. It’s a feasting ground for flies.“It means that maggots are hatching in gardens, bins and also on dead animals around suburban homes and gardens.”According to Peter, home and business owners are only now discovering they are living with maggots thanks to the recent drop in temperatures.“Rats and mice aren’t stupid. If a building isn’t rodent proof they know how to get in out the cold.The problem is, when well-meaning homeowners put down DIY poisoning theyll die in the walls – but flies lay their eggs on those rotting corpses.“This week we’ve been called out to an opticians with maggots falling from the ceiling in the client waiting area. That was as the result of a dead animal in the vents.“A restaurant also had to temporarily shut up shop because maggots were dropping down into their customers food. It is distressing for everyone involved.”Maggots can be killed with boiling water – but pest control experts advise to always look for the reason behind why the maggots hatched in the first place.Peter’s advice is simple: “As disgusting as they are there is always an even more sinister reason you’ve got them. Identy that and you’re sorted.“It could be a dead pigeon in the roof or a poisoned rotting mouse under the floorboards. Flies love bacteria-spewing corpses and will lay dozens of eggs on them.“If they are in your bins – you need to make sure clean them out regularly, with a disinfectant. They need a good seal and ensure that rubbish is properly bagged up.“Finally make sure your building is pest proof.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All areas must be maintained in a clean condition.”Inspectors swooped on the premises after receiving a complaint about a lack of hot water on the premises.The unnamed inspector said: “There was no

routes.But truckers face a mammoth 58-mile ersion which has been set up by Highways England bosses.They will have to go from the closure in Southampton, up to Salisbury and then back to Southapmton via the A34.The normal journey would take less than ten minutes but the new route across two counties will take two hours.Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service described it as the biggest traffic ersion ever in the country. Duncan Buchanan, policy director for the Road Haulage Association [RHA], slammed the plans.He said: I am stunned by the suggested alternative route for HGVs, it is truly an enormous distance.“It is a monster ersion, taking lorries a zillion miles out of their way.We think of Highways England as having one job to do and that is to run the road network correctly for key users.Its a debacle and they are not focused on this and key road users.”The RHA said a single trip along the ersion route would cost a haulier an extra £35 in fuel alone.Malcolm Gibson, managing director of Hampshire-based international freight company Steve Porter Transport, said: It will certainly affect some of our customers who are travelling to us.“The section between junctions three and five is an integral part of the M27 for hauliers.Highways England said the closure was picked at the quietest of times.A spokesman for Highways England said: Completing these key phases of work at the weekend means that restrictions can be kept to a minimum at other, busier, times.“We understand that these closures will inevitably cause considerable disruption in the area and we advise that road users plan journeys in advance, especially those heading for the ports.“We also urge drivers – especially those of HGVs or similar heavy and high-sided vehicles – to follow the signed ersion routes as these have been chosen as they are the most suitable routes and can cope with heavy flows of traffic.”Further weekend closures are scheduled next year between April 26-29 and October 18-21.The

He was dead.The tragic cockapoo — a mix of the cocker spaniel and poodle — was just the latest casualty of a growing global demand for fashionable hybrid pets.The mostly criminal market to supply these designer dogs leaves a trail of horrendous abuse and suffering, with animal lovers often unaware of the high cost of cute.A look inside unlicensed puppy farms reveals dogs whose coats are stained yellow from lying in their own waste. Mothers in crammed cages suckle their puppies — both dead and alive.And those who are considered not cute enough to make the grade are suffocated, battered to death or left to die in a bin, riddled with maggots.For every “perfect” pup that finds a loving home, many more are systematically destroyed. So horrendous has this market become, even the man who created the first ever labradoodle wishes he had never done it.Wally Conron successfully mated a labrador with a poodle in late 1980s to create Sultan for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia. He was motivated by a blind woman‘s desire for a guide dog that would not shed hair because her husband was allergic to it.But 30 years on Wally, now 90, says he regrets his experiment because it opened a “Pandora’s box”.Like drug trafficking, the designer dog world is predominantly run by organised criminals, whose only concern is making a profit.In 2012, the UK relaxed its border controls for travelling with pets. This opened the floodgates for trafficking in and out of the country.Dogs are mainly smuggled into the UK from Ireland, Ukraine and Hungry, flouting laws saying they must be at least 15 weeks old, microchipped, vaccinated against rabies, treated for tapeworm and have a pet passport.Organised gangs will also steal pedigree pets from their owners and take them to a breeding farm. Prices start at £500 and can rise to £3,000 depending on what you order.“Custom-made” and “allergy-free” dogs like Sultan can fetch even higher price tags.Along with the cockapoo, popular hybrid breeds include puggle , labradoodle , sprocker , Minnie Jack  and maltipoo .While dogs are the main focus of the designer pet industry, there are also kitten mills. The twisty cat or “squitten” is a cat bred specically for the deformity of stunted forelegs, so it looks like a cross between a cat and a squirrel.Fuelled by social media — Instagram is full of accounts for designer dogs — the appetite for hybrids seems never-ending. To feed this desire, organised criminals play God, creating Frankendogs — while destroying those who do not make the grade.Unlicensed and unregistered, they are free to treat the animals any way they like.Last year I was part of a team that raided a large puppy farm in Hawaiian Gardens, a city in Los Angeles County, which is where we discovered the dead cockapoo with the sign around its neck.We were alerted to the farm after receiving calls from people who bought puppies there that became seriously ill or died within days. The operation had no permits for boarding, breeding or selling.Our investigation revealed puppies who were about two weeks old, with designer breeds including miniature pinscher, Lhasa apso, dachshund, Maltese, poodle, Korean Jindo and English bulldog — all in ill health and kept in appalling conditions.In the breeding area, there were dogs with ulcerated eyes who were lethargic and unresponsive. Ears and tails cut off and tossed in bin. Wire cages were stacked and crammed with animals.The odours from the birthing secretions, dead puppies, filth, ammonia, faeces and mucus were awful. The puppies that were still alive were silent. We seized 367 dogs in total.The owners were banned from running any animal-related business and had to pay a fine of £65,000. Not long after, we raided another pet shop in Lynwood, also in Los Angeles County.We were met with another horric scene: Animals left to die in a bin behind the store, others covered in faeces, suffering from a catalogue of health problemsThere was a bloody newspaper over a table and syringes and sedatives in a bin. Some dogs’ ears and tails had been cut off and were crying in pain, their severed ears tossed into a bin.The investigation later revealed that when the store owner no longer wanted the animals — usually because they had medical issues or were no longer puppies — he suffocated them, beat them or threw them against the wall.The owner was convicted on multiple charges of animal cruelty and received six years in prison. These cases may have been in America but they are typical of the cruelty and neglect designer dogs can suffer all over the world in the push for profit.Animals like the ones found in these case frequently have ongoing medical problems for the rest of their lives. Sadly, the puppies were likely born ill, from overbred and malnourished mothers, and survived stressful transport to the pet shop only to be mistreated.They were born in squalor, transported in pain and then left in wretched conditions waiting to be bought. At only weeks old, they would have known no relief, no care and no peace.Our investigation has not been without its dficulties. While we have rescued tens of thousands of dogs from horric puppy farms and pet shops, we have received a backlash from some of the breeders.Sometimes they will break into our animal shelters and try to steal the seized dogs back. Other times they will throw rocks at our windows or send us threatening emails. But nothing is going to stop us from getting the message out there.I hope that by shining a light on this dark world, people will stop buying crossbreeds. And in turn this will stop the maltreatment and violence associated with the creation of designer dogs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In negotiations you do that.“But we need credible responses for the proposals we have set out or credible alternatives, and we haven’t seen them yet.”Saturday marks the six-month countdown to Brexit on March 29. But Mr Raab — the 44-year-old former Foreign Office lawyer — made it clear there can be no extension to talks past the summit planned for November 18.He said any delay, even to December, would leave it “extremely dficult” for either side to pass it through parliament.The Brexit Secretary added: “Otherwise we will end up with, in some ways what might be the worst case, which is a deal but without the time to implement it.”Despite the ticking clock, he admitted Brussels is yet to respond to Mrs May’s demand for movement from the EU.He said: “The ball is in their court.You wouldn’t expect to unblock some of those bigger sticking points around Northern Ireland and the Economic Partnership by now.”Warning that Britain won’t be reduced to begging, he added: “We are not some minnow. We are one of the biggest EU economies, one of the biggest economies in the world.“We are not going to get on our hands and knees and crawl back cap in hand for this deal.We are going to extend the arm of friendship, and see  it is reciprocated.”And in a rallying call to unite a split Tory Party, he said: “When we have got a deal negotiated with the EU and the option of No Deal, I think it will focus minds and I am confident that colleagues will put some of those dferences behind them and we will unite around a common position.”BRUSSELS has threatened to slap tough border limits on Brits  Theresa May’s post-EU immigration plans go ahead.Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, pictured below, warned of a tit-for-tat battle in a letter ahead of the Tory party conference.The PM will unveil plans to end priority job access for EU nationals and focus on those with in-demand skills.Mr Verhofstadt said the bloc will not sign a deal discriminating on nationality or type of job. It means emigrating Brits would face controls like EU citizens in the UK.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But not anymore.It was unmistakably a big cat, it was enormous. It was around four feet long and it had a long curved tail which was around 18 inches long.There was no mistaking it for anything else, it was caught right in the beam of my torch and it was the eyes I saw first, they were bright green and around the size of an old penny.I was a bit apprehensive because it was quite a short distance away from me, only about 30 to 40 yards but from that distance I could tell it wasnt a dog or a domestic cat.I called out for Judith, my we, but she had gone back into the house so she didnt see it. He rigged up the camera near his home in Gatebeck, near Kendal, on September 11 and only had to wait two days before this photo was taken.Roy added: When I saw the picture it came as no shock to me because I knew what I had seen - I wasnt drunk and Ive no reason to make up a thing like that.What the image does achieve is to confirm its size. The water trough in the picture is six feet long so taking perspective into account the cat must be about 3ft 9in long. This is just the latest potential sighting in the local area.An estate agent friend of Roys reported seeing a big cat on his driveway as she was driving past on her way home.And during the cold snap earlier this year his son-in-law took a video showing giant paw prints the size of a mans gloved hand. Roy believes the cat lives in the vast expanse of wild countryside that borders the M6 through south Cumbria and feeds on rabbits.Since 2003 there have been reports of a large black cat in the same area with numerous sightings at Kendal, Sizergh, Sedbergh, Brigsteer and Witherslack.Last Stuart Wild and his we Liz were enjoying a stroll in the Lake District when they came across a similar creature near the hamlet of Little Langdale.Liz, 54, from Worcester, said at the time: There were some sheep in the field and one of my friends said: Look at that dog.But it was very feline and very, very big. You know how a cat stalks? It was like that. It was jet black and walking slowly. In March 2016 holidaying midwe Claire Greensmith spotted a “big, black panther-like creature” while hiking at a Colwith Force near Ambleside, In March 2015 a Freedom of Information request revealed that Cumbria Police had received 40 big cat sightings since 2003.Danny Bamping, from the British Big Cat Society, was doubtful that Roys photo was of a big cat.He said: The picture clearly shows a domestic cat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past 12 months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past 20 years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number 10 for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet?”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But even  they get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for 2022. The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in 1951 or even the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend 45 minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I dont know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe.Horrying footage which emerged shortly after shows the terrying moment people ran screaming after the devastating tsunami smashed the region.The video - reportedly taken on top of a shopping mall - shows the wave building up just off the shore.Just a few seconds later, the 7ft high wave can be seen crashing into the beach, immediately flattening houses in its path and submerging the entire area.Dwikorita Karnawati, who heads Indonesias meteorology and geophysics agency, BMKG, said panic gripped the city after the wave struck.She said the situation was chaotic with people running on the streets and buildings collapsing.Nina, a 23-year-old woman who goes by one name, was working at a laundry service shop not far from the beach when the quake hit.She said the quake destroyed her workplace, but she managed to escape and quickly went home to get her mother and younger brother.The three of us ran, but got separated. Now I dont know where my mother and brother are. I dont know how to get information. I dont know what to do.The quake rocked central Sulawesi in Indonesia just hours after a smaller tremor killed one and injured another 10.The US Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.5 quake was centred at a depth of 6miles about 35 miles northeast of the town of Donggala, Sulawesi.Indonesias meteorology agency initially issued an early tsunami warning for people in Central Sulawesi and West Sulawesi provinces, but this has since been lted.Earlier on Friday, the same area was hit by a magnitude 6.1 earthquake that killed one person, injured 10 and damaged dozens of houses.An official with the local disaster agency, Akris, said: Many houses have collapsed. It happened while we still have dficulties in collecting data from nine villages affected by the first quake. People ran out in panic.Donggala resident Mohammad Fikri said by telephone that he ran from his house but there wasnt great panic in his neighborhood.He said: All the things in my house were swaying and the quake left a small crack on my wall.But this was not the first time. Last week we felt an earthquake that had a stronger tremor so this time we didnt panic, just avoided the buildings and now everything has ed to normal.A series of earthquakes in July and August killed nearly 500 people on the holiday island of Lombok, hundreds of kilometres southwest of Sulawesi.Indonesia sits on the Pacic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.In 2004, a big earthquake measuring 9.1 struck off the northern Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia."},{"url":null,"title":"mob teenager paris batter teen","story":"Grim footage shows a gang allegedly trying to kill their victim in broad daylight on a council estate in the northern Paris suburbs on Wednesday afternoon.Makesht weapons including hockey sticks, petanque balls and a crutch were used to repeatedly beat the youth around the head and upper body.He was finally dragged away by terried locals who witnessed the assault, and was rushed to an intensive care unit.Today three youths including a 14-year-old schoolboy were charged with attempted murder in France after footage of the fight went viral.The images – which involve mainly youths in their early teens – come at a time of increasing gang violence in France, especially on the tinderbox housing complexes surrounding major cities.The latest outrage unfolded in Garges-les-Gonesse in Val-d’Oise, 20 miles from the centre of Paris.It was a terrying attack, said an investigating source. The thugs can be seen using their weapons to beat the le out of the boy.He tried to hide underneath a car, but was dragged from underneath it, and then everybody got involved.Many had hoods up, and were wearing caps, but their faces were still easily identiable.The blows went on and on, even when it was obvious he couldn’t take anymore. Adults living can be heard shouting, and calling for the boy to be released.What happened is being linked to a feud between rival gangs, and a settling of scores. It could easily have ended in murder, but the boy was quickly rushed to hospital.He was suffering from severe head injuries, and underwent emergency treatment. His le is no longer in danger.Around ten suspects were involved in the attack, with those now in custody including the two schoolboys aged 14 and 16, and a 20-year-old man.A judicial enquiry was opened on Friday afternoon, as magistrates said they were investigating attempted murder, aggravated violence, and an armed gang attack.The two minors were held in pre-trial detention facility, while the third defendant was placed on remand in an adult prison.Nobody linked to the case – either attackers or victim – have yet been identied by the French authorities, who are appealing for witnesses to come forward.They believe that the lynching was related to an earlier attack in the same district, when youths aged 16 and 19 were wounded by lead shot fired by a rival gang member, said the source.On Saturday families living locally will join marches calling for peace and understanding between young people."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle samantha london talks dad thomas","story":"The outspoken 53-year-old – who has not seen her sister in more than a decade – tweeted today she was having a wonderful time in the capital.She wrote: Having a wonderful time in London!

Thats one reason this sort of knowledge is so important.”He is now on the hunt to trace his British siblings, and will use other DNA testing companies in the hope of making more connections.The story of Ivos biological dad can be compared to that of British scientist Bertold Wiesner, who may have fathered 600 children after making donations to a fertility programme he ran with his we."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436737576-e1538236903776.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady the apprentice launch slippery excuses","story":"Sixteen budding entrepreneurs battling it out to win £250k of Lord Sugar’s own money as an investment to start their own business.Alan goes into partnership with the winner — and that’s where Claude Littner and I come in.We are there to make sure he chooses the right person, by watching what happens when the contestants are out on tasks.People know it’s that time of year when they see Claude and I out on the streets with a notepad, pen and film crew.We don’t mentor, we don’t coach or give any guidance, we simply watch what unfolds. And what is amazing to me is how often people try to wriggle out of things and deny a decision they made, in a bid to stay in the process. So when they sit in the boardroom saying, “I didn’t . . . ” we can say, “Oh yes you did . . . ”Some people ask me  certain scenes are staged, but the show is unique in that there are no retakes, there is no setting up of scenes and no trying to find the comedy moment — they just come naturally.All of Alan’s jokes come naturally, too. There is no script, no autocue, it happens as it happens.Luckily, we get on very well — Claude, Alan and I. So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them?Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids 22 years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing 60 women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as 17.He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,  you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one cares  you have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £75 to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s going to die any minute. Say something. She might hear it. The phone is by her ear.’“I said, ‘Tashi I love you so much, darling. I’ll be with you soon. I’ll be with you.”“‘When you’ve got children, you don’t want them to be without you, do you? They haven’t flown the nest.They still need you.“I fell to the ground. I couldn’t talk, I was engulfed with grief. I knew then she was gone.’”Natasha died from a reaction to sesame seeds in a £3.45 artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought at a Heathrow Pret.The meal had no allergy warning on its packaging.Natasha fell ill on a British Airways flight as she, Nadim and a pal headed for a break in the south of France in July 2016. She died in hospital in Nice.At last week’s inquest coroner Sean Cummings slammed Pret for failing to alert customers to potentially fatal allergens.Pret was warned nine times about the dangers of sesame in its artisan baguettes in the year before Natasha died.Toy firm director Tanya, from Fulham, West London, said of the firm: “They screwed up, yes. Now they have the opportunity to do something good. They could lobby for a change to our labelling laws.“We know Natasha didn’t die on our watch. She died on Pret’s watch, all thanks to the absence of two little words.“If the label had listed ‘sesame seeds’ Natasha wouldn’t have touched it and she’d still be alive.“Nadim trusted Natasha knew what to look for.”For dad Nadim the moment they made that choice is replayed over and over in his mind.And the memory brings him to tears. He said: “I hate myself. I blame myself. I really love my daughter, in a way that’s like one flesh.“As a parent I’d die a thousand times, crucied, for her to live.“I spent 15 years nurturing the most precious thing in my le. As a human being, there’s nothing more important than that.“In that moment, how could it be that I failed her? I will live with that until I die, but so it is.“I’m so glad it wasn’t Tanya’s watch because I don’t think she could have taken it’.” Mum Tanya was at home when she got the call at 9.30am.She said: “Nad was crying and said, ‘Tanya you’ve got to come out here. Natasha’s not well. Something terrible has happened.’ Initially I thought, it’s not that bad, I wanted reassurance. But Nad was saying, ‘Start looking for flights. It’s really bad.’“I was praying. Please God, don’t take her from me.”As Natasha was taken to Nice hospital, Tanya raced to Stansted. She said: “The lady at check-in said, I’m sorry, the flight’s full.“I said, ‘You’ve got to get me to France, my daughter’s dying.“Then, we were told there was a delay for six hours. I was constantly crying. Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within two minutes and I had to say goodbye. And I did.“I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding.“I couldn’t howl, scream or cry as I was surrounded by families. I got on the plane. Tears were falling the whole time.Freshly prepared items at London branches of Greggs, EAT and fast food chains Wasabi and itsu had no allergy warnings on them.Even Pret a Manger is still using the loophole, with no warnings on packets. The law says that when food is prepared onsite, ingredient labelling is not necessary.It is designed to protect small, independent stores.At the busy shops we investigated – EAT, Pret, Wasabi and itsu at Canary Wharf Shopping Mall in East London – allergy information signs were in cabinets, urging customers to ask.But at Greggs in Chrisp Street Market no signs were visible — despite assurances from chiefs that allergy signs were there.Every shop we visited failed to feature any information on packaging for food made in-house.“It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.That he needed my love and understanding. I knew how much he loved Natasha. I felt so much of his pain with mine.”Nadim added: “The last thing she ever said was “Daddy, Daddy, help me. I can’t breathe.” I held her and kept talking to her. Minutes later she was gone.’ Nadim, who is considering suing Pret, added: “I spent a year on the sofa. I wrote two suicide letters. I felt it was so unfair.“We haven’t touched her room. Her clothes are still on the floor.“I still look for her on the street, in public places. Adidas trainers, long dark hair in a bun. I look but she’s just lost. You don’t know how you carry on living.”Teenager Natasha Ednan-Laperouse’s death should serve as a warning of how dangerous this practice is.The law states that when food is prepared onsite, ingredients labelling is not necessary. It is designed to protect small, independent stores. But our investigation today reveals large chains have not learnt from this avoidable tragedy.Pret a Manger was warned nine times about the dangers of sesame seed in its artisan baguettes and yet it continues to sell items without allergy warnings.Now Natasha’s mother Tanya has challenged the chain to lobby for a change in our labelling laws.And, hopefully, stop other parents having to suffer such a terrible loss.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the coming weeks he will decide which one of 16 young entrepreneurs will become his business partner.  But as series 14 of The Apprentice starts on Wednesday, Lord Sugar’s trusted aide thinks his no-nonsense pal’s talents are being under used.   Claude Littner is convinced the Government should tell Lord Sugar: “You’re hired” – to help with Brexit talks.  With the prospect of a no deal looking ever more likely, Claude, 69, said: “The fact people like Alan are not being used by this Government with Brexit is a real, real mistake. “There is a role for him and many other entrepreneurs who could at least advise on the best tactics, strategy, way of approaching [talks] – you wouldn’t want to miss out on that.” He argued that an entrepreneur with experience working in Europe could give a politician’s argument more weight.  But Claude does not think Lord Sugar will for not aim for high office, like his US counterpart and now President Donald Trump. “I don’t think he’s got that kind of ambition,” said Claude. Despite Lord Sugar’s many successes, his forays into social \u0026shymedia, like those of Mr Trump, have not always worked out. Last month the peer was branded “sexist” after posting photo of a female shopkeeper showing ample cleavage. During the World Cup a tweet comparing the Senegal football team to people selling sunglasses on the beach sparked calls he be axed from the show. Claude said: “That was completely absurd. There’s nobody else who could do The Apprentice. He’s made the show his own, he’s fantastic – he is the show. Sometimes he does act inopportunely but that’s him. “I’ve been involved with Alan for a very long time. And where sometimes I would think being quiet is a better policy than actually speaking, Alan is one who says what he wants to say when he wants to say it. He’s not going to listen to what people say.  “That’s the nature of the man. He is direct – he’s got the strength of his convictions, and occasionally it doesn’t quite work out. “That doesn’t mean to say he’s not right, he just shouldn’t have expressed it that particular way at that particular time. Most of the time I think he’s spot on.” Lord Sugar, 71, will certainly not bite his tongue on The Apprentice as he reduces even the thickest-skinned hopeful to a quivering wreck in the boardroom. And they are unlikely to get sympathy from Claude or fellow aide Karren Brady. Stoney-faced Claude and his crushing analysis of the candidates can be as harsh as Lord Sugar’s verdicts. Claude said: “Normally the candidates are petried and don’t want to antagonise me – or anyone else – as that might have a detrimental effect on them.” But little can sway frosty Claude, even when the female candidates try flirting with him. He said: “The girls do all the time. I remember the interview with Katie Hopkins all those years ago, she was very flirty. It didn’t get her anywhere. If I was in their position I’d also try to be extra-friendly – why wouldn’t you? “I’m Jekyll and Hyde. I’m a good bloke but when it comes to business I’ve got a dferent persona. I’m stern. I never say hello, never give them eye contact.  “I’m rude – I ignore them completely and look at them with disdain, That way, nobody can say that I’ve got any favourites. “I’m not their nursemaid. I’m not going to say, ‘you poor thing, what a shame. Come on back in, I’ll help resolve the situation’. “I’m not the cause of their problem, they’re finding stress dficult – well, le is sometimes stressful, business is sometimes stressful and I’m not there to guide them through.” Sparks fly in the women’s team on Wednesday when the candidates travel to Malta. Claude said: “I could never understand why they are so antagonistic to each other. I think it’s a shame they react that way and can’t settle down earlier on and focus on the task – rather than on being catty to each other. “Maybe that’s human nature. They’re super excited, stressed, don’t know what’s expected from them or whether to put themselves forward. “Once the boys and girls are all mixed up they calm down. There’s a sort of mutual respect and understanding, whereas when it’s all girls or all guys they can’t help but get into conflict with each other.” Claude, who featured at the interviews stage of the show before replacing Nick Hewer as Lord Sugar’s aide in 2015, prefers The Apprentice to a former job as chief exec of Tottenham Hotspur.

If so, it might explain why we’ve still got the garden furniture out as we head into October. Not because of what’s in the sky but because it’s hard to recall a time when the so-called serious, grown-up events that are meant to shape the world have drawn so many belly laughs. Look at the entire United Nations General Assembly rolling around in stitches like Martian robots on the old Smash advert this week as the world’s most powerful man addressed them. When Donald Trump announced “my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of this country”, he was drowned out with guffaws. This has literally never happened in this very sombre organisation’s 73-year history. Was it his hair, the ease with which fiction leaves his puckered lips, or his rare show of modesty by using the word “almost”? Who knows.  But those delegates were smirking again when Trump accused the Chinese of interfering in US elections without mentioning the Russians, whose foreign minister stared at his phone, struggling to keep a straight face. Mind you, the rest of the world has been struggling to do the same ever since Vladimir Putin claimed the two hitmen he’d sent to Salisbury to take out Sergei Skripal were simply Songs of Praise fans who adored the cathedral so much they saved all their rubles to come over and gaze at its spire. Which was funny. But now it’s been revealed that one of those hitmen was an elite special forces colonel in Russian \u0026shyintelligence who was awarded the country’s top military honour, it gets even funnier. How less elite can a special forces spook be than one who leaves his grinning mug plastered all over CCTV street cameras? I know, one who can’t bump off a pensioner whose greatest pleasure appears to be sitting in pubs and restaurants supping lager. Not that us Brits aren’t coming up with the laughs. UKIP MEP Lord Dartmouth has quit the party because it’s become too racist. Eh? That’s like quitting Mumsnet because all the women keep banging on about babies. Why else did he join?  Then, after Jeremy Corbyn’s \u0026shyconference speech, there were the right-wing papers lampooning him in one breath as an eccentric Catweazle figure with loony policies, then in the next warning the Tories they need to take him seriously as a disillusioned Middle England could just buy them. Which brings us to Birmingham turning into Comedy Central next week when loose-dentured geriatrics spill their colostomy bags all over the Tory conference hall as their G-spots take direct hits from misty-eyed Brexiters fantasising about Victorian maids cycling through villages where everything, from the cricket flannels to the faces, are white. Remember last year when Theresa May’s cough-laden speech was so boring even the letters behind her dropped off?

Anwar Nyanzi was 11 months old when he got on a chair while his aunt’s back was turned, hoisted himself on to a window ledge at the block of flats and fell out. With severe brain and spinal injuries, he had what was said to be a one per cent chance of survival. But he somehow began breathing unaided again and was standing up within weeks of the fall. His mum Hawa Rutansingwa said: “It was nothing short of a miracle. He pulled through despite having gone through the stuff of nightmares.”  She collapsed when she arrived at the scene of the accident and saw him. Hawa, 32, said: “His head was like a balloon. One of his eyes was almost popping out of his head... “But he proved himself a fighter.” Anwar fell from his aunt Fauzia’s third-floor flat in Croydon, South London, while Hawa was at work. Fauzia was sickened when she noticed Anwar had vanished and saw him motionless on the ground. She phoned 999 and called Hawa who rushed there too.  Over four days in intensive care at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, Anwar had brain surgery and treatment for broken ribs and arms. Hawa, who works in the healthcare sector, said: “I went with my brother and mother to kiss my son goodbye... It was horrible.” Anwar’s dad, who lives in Uganda, made arrangements to fly to Britain to say farewell too. Mum-of-three Hawa said the moment her lad astonished everyone by breathing for himself was “indescribable”.

British producers are creating mouth-watering cured meats developed through new techniques and fuelled by UK customers’ growing passion for top quality locally-sourced product. In 2010 there were just 10 British cured meat makers – eight years later that has risen dramatically to more than 200.

Sean Cannon – who set up his business in London in 2011 – said: Artisan charcuterie is exploding. Britain is now producing distinctive, world-class products. We have the potential to make the best charcuterie in the world because we raise the best livestock.  “We are also not controlled by strict rules, such as those for Parma Ham, so we can be more adventurous with our creations. “Like many people, I thought you couldn’t make charcuterie in this country but the demand has just outstripped supply. “There are exceptional European hams that have taken 250 years to develop – there’s nothing else like them. “At the moment big Italian and French producers aren’t worried.

Many of the abandoned pets are starving and abused, with gaping wounds or missing limbs. In winter they barely survive freezing temperatures, in summer they boil. And Laura, 31, faces a race against time to find and save the strays before the dog catchers who will put them down. She said: “I’ve seen so many horrendous things. If they were in Britain there would be outrage.” The charity worker in the Romanian city of Bacau, 1,600 miles from home and a “comfortable country lestyle” where she had a long-term partner.  In May 2016 Laura’s le changed when she started volunteering for Sadie’s Stray Dog Rescue, which has treated and \u0026shyre-homed 700 pups to loving British families in the past four years. Laura said simply: “I saw things I couldn’t unsee.” Laura now lives in a “grotty” one-bed apartment in the city near Transylvania and works 15-hour days in a country where she does not speak the language. She split from her boyfriend before leaving the UK and quit an equestrian industry job. She said: “People probably think I’m mad but this is where my passion, future and calling is – we’re saving lives here. “Sadly, finding starving, stray dogs who are either barely surviving in freezing \u0026shytemperatures or practically boiling alive in extreme heat is the norm. “Some are pets abandoned after \u0026shybecoming too much work or money to take care of. Many have been abused, with gaping wounds or missing limbs. Some we find tied up or with limbs missing.” Each Romanian city has council-run shelters where government dog-catchers who patrol the streets take the strays.  But these are dubbed kill shelters by campaigners – as those which are unclaimed after 14 days are euthanised. Laura, from Lamport, Northants, said: “The conditions at public shelters are \u0026shyappalling. We do all we can to avoid strays being sent there. “They are captured using poles. It’s inhumane and the animals scream in fear. Once they’re caught, most are slaughtered anyway to make room for the vast numbers of other strays that must come through the system. There’s very little real care there.” Sadie’s Stray Dog Rescue can cope with 250 pups and kittens and tries to take as many as they can. Laura has been exposed to hundreds of horric cases. She saw a female dog who had just one leg, the other three had been chopped off. Another caught in a wire snare trap had a huge wound around her middle, while a third had a leg hanging by a thread after being hit by a car. It was amputated and the dog made a full recovery. Laura said: “One called Nora we found with her nose nearly sliced off, but with some \u0026shysurgery she made a full recovery and now has a wonderful home in the UK.”  But for some, such as a dog in the final stages of distemper, the rescuers are too late and the kindest action is to have the pooches put to sleep. Laura said: “What I used to think \u0026shyimportant seems a million miles away.” She used to travel around Europe and America with her showjumping boyfriend and earned a steady wage renting out stables. She said: “I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth but I had a fortunate le in the UK. I used to have nice holidays, go to events, parties and balls, with a social le which meant an awful lot. “Now, my le is unglamorous but so much more rewarding. I am on call 24/7 for emergency pick-ups. “Each of our dogs requires feeding and cleaning, so I’ll get stuck in to that, and make sure worming and tick medications are up to date. “I’ll update weight and vaccination records for dogs that are due to travel and post pictures for our social media channels.” The pups she rescues are checked by vets, vaccinated and travel to the UK with proper paperwork as approved by Britain’s government standards.  The non-profit organisation, named after an adopted dog which was killed in Romania before she could leave for her new home, was founded in 2014 by Lesley Ford, from Banbury, Oxon. With over 9,000 Facebook followers, Sadie’s has 12 volunteers in the UK and four on the frontline in Romania. The country has 65,000 stray dogs in the capital Bucharest alone. We previously reported how almost 1,200 illegally smuggled puppies were seized at UK borders over the past two years. Many of this number – thought to be just the tip of the iceberg – came from Eastern Europe. She said: “It breaks my heart when criminals ship tiny puppies for quick cash. They undermine Romania’s legitimate re-homing operations and all the passion and hard work that goes into them.” Two months ago Bucharest authorities banned the sale of dog and cats at pet shops in a bid to boost adoptions from animal shelters like Sadie’s. In 2008 Romania outlawed abandoning, hurting and unnecessarily killing animals. But Laura said: “Unfortunately due to the sheer numbers of dogs, official bodies can often justy the decision to slaughter, while evidence of cruelty is just re here – so the laws don’t seem to count for much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"horse walks bar wetherspoons staff","story":"NewsA horse walks into a bar - but Wetherspoons staff don\u0027t see funny sideThe surprising visit of horse dragged in by a customer called Tommy to the Sir Henry Newbolt in Bilston in the West Midlands didn\u0027t cause \u0027long faces\u0027 among the regularsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte PaxtonPippa Allen-Kinross18:17, 29 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/man-takes-horse-into-pub-13332259,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Customers and staff at a Wetherspoons pub in the West Midlands may have felt like the punchline to a bad joke after a horse walked into the bar.

Gerry McCann spoke of his “painful” dreams about his daughter, who vanished in Portugal 11 years ago, just nine days short of her fourth birthday. Surgeon Gerry, 52, broke down and sobbed as he said he was “absolutely confident” she is alive – a view backed up by Scotland Yard’s plea for more funds to probe the mystery. He said: “It’s almost like an instinctive reaction... it’s just a feeling... but I do feel we will be reunited. “I just want to hug her and hold her and cry... a lot.”  Gerry also gave the most harrowing account yet of the pain he and we Kate, 52, have borne since Madeleine vanished from an Ocean Club apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. He told of Kate’s screams at the discovery and how the couple were plagued by “the darkest thoughts” of their eldest daughter being “abused”. Gerry recalled the numbing moment that reality dawned that their girl was gone. He said: “I remember just being in the bedroom – the two of us just completely distraught. It was almost feral, the reaction and the pain, feeling helpless, alone. “I couldn’t get the darkest thoughts out of our minds that somebody had taken her and abused her.” A series of police probes have failed to shed any light on Madeleine’s whereabouts. But Gerry, from Rothley, Leics, said: “I thought about it a lot early on and what I was absolutely confident about is whatever had happened Madeleine was still alive and is still alive.  “There’s never a day goes by I don’t think about Madeleine and what might have happened. I have dreamt about her, including in the last few months, but it’s not frequent. “They’re painful when they happen.” Gerry revealed his agony during a BBC Radio 4 programme about the bond between fathers and daughters. It was broadcast as the Home Office last night considered whether to grant new funds to continue the \u0026pound11.6million, seven-year British police investigation to find her. This week Scotland Yard formally applied to the Home Office for cash to extend Operation Grange for another six months and the move is expected to be rubber-stamped. Officers have investigated 60 people of interest and 560 lines of enquiry, but the last funding for the four-person Operation Grange team is due to run out today. The probe was launched in 2011 after the original Portuguese investigation was ruled “not fit for purpose”. Former Met Police counter-terorrism detective David Videcette backed new funding and said: “Good investigations take time.” Gerry spoke about how Madeleine’s siblings – Sean and Amelie, now 13 – helped him and Kate carry on.  He said: “The twins kept us going. Having two other children, trying to make sure they had enough love and attention that they deserved in their own right was incredibly important and thank God, I don’t know what it would have been like without them. “Thank God Sean and Amelie have had each other, but that they’ve missed out on having such a lovely big sister is very painful. Often my memories, happy memories, are of a girl who was almost four, but you look at Amelie and how she’s developed and you can’t help but think what would she look like. “Anniversaries are obviously really dficult and birthdays in particular, but also seeing Sean and Amelie going through all the stages I imagine Madeleine would.” Gerry choked back tears as he reminisced about cradling Madeleine in his arms, watching her go swimming and running around the garden before watching Dr Who. He went on: “The relationship I had with Madeleine was incredibly special. Between myself, Kate and Madeleine, it was like an equilateral triangle. “When Madeleine was very young she had really bad colic. She would get a lot of discomfort. I used to put her on my chest and rub her back and one of the things she used to do was pull the hairs on my chest really tightly. “It was quite painful and it seemed to ease her burden a little bit and I felt like I was taking some of it.  “I suppose all that contact time and skin-to-skin contact I did feel I had formed a really strong bond with her. “All parents think that their child is amazing and most children are, but some of the stuff I was able to do with Madeleine – the conversations she could have, her character, personality, it was really fantastic. “She really loved running around the garden and playing games and being chased and laughing. “And swimming, she loved swimming. You would take her to the leisure centre and she would just march out to her instructor with her cap on and goggles – smiling, no anxiety or fear. She was in there.” Gerry gave a gripping account of the moment he realised Madeleine vanished during their holiday in the Algarve. And he told of his immediate fear that she had been kidnapped by a paedophile. He said: “Kate came running back from the apartment screaming ‘Madeleine is missing, she’s gone’. I was like ‘She can’t be gone’. “I was looking in the bedroom, I was in cupboards, checking everywhere – even places where I knew she couldn’t be, under the kitchen sink.  “It was disbelief, shock, horror and then panic and terror. “I haven’t thought about those moments for a long time because, as you can imagine, it’s pretty painful. “I felt that every moment we couldn’t find her was worse and I remember being slumped on the floor and starting to call some of my family members and just saying ‘pray for her’ because I thought that was the only thing that might help at that point.” Gerry added: “There was an overwhelming feeling of helplessness that we couldn’t do anything and I think that experience we were feeling right at the centre of it was like a ripple or a tidal wave going out and crashing into all our family and friends as they found out what had happened. “That first night felt like it lasted forever. Obviously we didn’t sleep and went out again first thing as soon as it was light. Kate and I went out walking the streets of Praia da Luz shouting Madeleine’s name. I remember asking the police to get helicopters and heat seeking equipment and the thought somebody could be across the border into borderless Europe, driving her. Or Africa – the ports are a couple of hours away. I remember thinking ‘get the borders closed’. “It’s like the sickest you’ve ever been. It’s the worst of the adrenaline, fear, anxiety that manests itself in quite dramatic physical symptoms.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mars snickers bars announce major","story":"NewsMars and Snickers bars announce MAJOR changes to their recipesHealthier ieties of chocolate bar will contain around 10g of protein and will be followed by low-calorie bars with less than 100 caloriesShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByStephen Hayward00:11, 30 SEP 2018NewsMars and Snickers are being given a healthy makeover \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMars and Snickers bars are to get a healthy makeover with big reductions in the amount of sugar they both contain, it has emerged.

The Snickers Protein will contain 14.1g of sugar, which is 30 per cent less than the original. Each of the new kinds will also contain 10g of protein, around half that of both existing ones. Trade magazine The Grocer reported that the two new products will be followed later in 2019 by a new low-calorie range of “single-serve” bars.

Simona Futter, 28, woke up on the morning of her daughter’s fth birthday to an excruciating headache, partial blindness and waves of intense nausea. Simona told Mirror: “I thought I had had a stroke in my sleep. Half my vision was gone, I couldn’t keep anything down, my headache was so, so bad and light was very annoying. “The doctor thought I had an inner ear infection, put me on antibiotics and sent me home. But the symptoms persisted. “One day I was driving home and suddenly felt so ill that I had to pull the top I was wearing out in front of me to throw up in it in the car. My clothes were wet through by the time I got home.  “I went for neurological tests at the hospital where they put me on a drip because I was so dehydrated from being ill, but they did not do a MRI and thought it was an inner ear infection there too. “The symptoms persisted for about four or five weeks so I thought I’d get my eyes tested.” In April 2016, Simona\u0027s eye test at Specsavers probably saved her le. Optometrist, Hardeep Bahra spotted swelling of the optic disc, a condition known as papilledema, when she looked at Simona’s eyes using a binocular microscope. Papilledema indicates raised pressure inside the skull, which could be caused by deadly conditions like a brain tumour or bleeding.  Simona, from Bracknell, was urgently referred to King Edwards Hospital in Windsor where a MRI scan confirmed papilledema. A second MRI detected a non-cancerous lump on her brain and a bleed during a follow-up consultation with her neurologist. Pressure on her brain was relieved with lumbar punctures but her tumour was not considered le-threatening so medics chose not to remove it. Simona said: “They found a lump in my head but it was so deep inside that operating on it could cause memory loss, or change my personality or affect my speech. So they decided not to operate. “But in December I woke up at about 2am feeling very unwell. I called mum and asked her to take the kids. “She came and called an ambulance which took me to Frimley Hospital where they said I had a brain bleed. “I was transferred to Charing Cross Hospital where I was for Christmas. Christmas was really sad in hospital. It was my first Christmas as a single mum and my kids were spending it with their dad.  “I didn’t even have time to buy them presents so my friend gave them presents for me. “I remember going to the bathroom and just crying it was so miserable. I had no glasses or contact lenses so I couldn’t see and I was sitting there blind and alone unable to see any other people in this enormous ward at Christmas. “We had to order our dinner from a menu but I couldn’t see so I ordered the wrong thing and didn’t even get potatoes.” Simona was discharged but in January 2018, she began to lose vision in her right eye prompting her to visit Specsavers again to see optometrist, Rina Binder. Rina diagnosed the  of papilledema and Simona was referred back to Charing Cross Hospital. “It was just after the New Year so the hospital was really busy and I was waiting for nine hours. “When they saw me they said my vascular tumour kept bleeding so they decided to operate because the risk of having a stroke and the damage that could cause outweighed the risks of surgery. “The tumour was 4.5cm but they had to wait and monitor me in hospital until the swelling in my head went down enough so they could operate. “It was like a ticking time bomb in my head. I never knew when it was going to bleed again and I just wanted it out. “Eight days later they operated. 15 doctors were there, Charring Cross is a training hospital too so some surgeons watched the operation to learn.

Community radio station radio DJ Christopher Oatway, 26, used the dating app to speak to someone who he believed was a teenage boy.  But when he arrived at Tesco in Chorlton, Manchester, in July last year, he realised the child was in fact an adult.  They demanded Oatway hand over cash, threatening to report him to the police  he didn\u0027t cough up.  He handed over \u0026pound50, reports the Manchester Evening News.  Oatway\u0027s crime was exposed a year later when he arranged to meet another \u002715-year-old boy\u0027, who turned out to be a member of a \u0027paedophile hunter\u0027 group.  Manchester Crown Court heard Oatway - who was involved in organising LGBT pride events in Stockport, Trafford and Rochdale - had been talking to someone purporting to be called \u0027Cody\u0027 on Grindr. They later agreed to meet in Manchester city centre. There Oatway, from Stockport, was met by a man. Police seized items from his home, including a mobile phone. Analysis revealed the Grindr conversations a year earlier and details of the meet-up at Tesco.  Oatway, who has no previous convictions, appeared at court relating to the earlier incident in Chorlton. The Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence relating to the incident in Manchester city centre. He was sentenced to a two-year community order, including a sex offender treatment program, after admitting attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child. Oatway must also sign the sex offender\u0027s register for five years.  Defending, Brendan O\u0027Leary said that Oatway was \u0027genuinely remorseful\u0027 and \u0027accepts what he did was wrong\u0027. He said the messages exchanged on Grindr showed that Oatway did not seek to engage in sexual activity with a child. When that was said it was genuine, it wasn\u0027t a ruse to trick the person into meeting him, Mr O\u0027Leary said. References submitted to the court spoke highly of Oatway, his barrister said, referencing his charity work, fundraising and how he is active in the LGBT community.

Amy Curtis, 26, suffered cuts to her face after she was assaulted twice in one night by a man and two women in Dublin.  After the attack she was left with a broken nose, a fractured cheekbone and fractured eye socket.  The shop assistant told Dublin Live : I was out with my cousin and we wanted to go for a dance, so decided to go over to a bar.  When we got there I\u0027d say we were there around three quarters of a hour and I bumped into a bloke on my way to the toilet. I said \u0027oh sorry\u0027 and he said \u0027watch where you\u0027re going you tramp\u0027. A bouncer came over separated us and thirty minutes later I went out for a cigarette.  She continued: The same bloke was out there and started being rude to me again so I began to argue back. His girlfriend came over after she saw us arguing and attacked me. I felt something hit me in the back of the head and heard glass break. The bouncer brought me outside to have a look at my head and told me I needed stitches. I had to walk to the hospital and on the way we ran into the same people from the bar.  They began to shout at me before starting to kick my face and head. The group ran off shouting abuse while I was in a pool of blood. I had a broken eye socket, fractured cheek bone and broken nose and when the doctor said I might need surgery I broke down. Since the attack last month, Amy said that she has had to take time off work and has been struggling to sleep.

Getting it wrong is how we grow up and learn to get it right. So when looking back at youthful misdeeds and misdemeanours it’s only fair to cut people a little slack. But when those mistakes are sex crimes, then the amount of slack that’s cut should be very, very small indeed. Dame Judi Dench touched on the issue this week when she was asked about her friend Kevin Spacey being replaced in films and TV shows in the wake of sex assault allegations. Spacey apologised for past behaviour but denied alleged assaults, some of which police are investigating.  Dame Judi said: “He is and was a most wonderful actor,” then asked  we would now “go back through history” to remove “anyone who has misbehaved in any way”. She has a point. We cannot just wipe all of Spacey’s work from the archive and pretend he never existed. But sexual assault is not just “misbehaving”, is it? It’s an offence, it’s a violation. It can damage a person’s mental health in a way that effectively destroys their le. Take TV legend Bill Cosby’s accusers. Only one of them, Andrea Constand, has seen justice. As the 81-year-old actor – described by the judge as a sexually violent predator – was carted off in handcuffs this week to begin a jail sentence of three to 10 years for assaulting her, I thought of the dozens of other women who bravely came forward to accuse him. Decades later they are still struggling to come to terms with being drugged and molested by a man we thought of as America’s dad, but who was actually the devil in disguise.  Because the time window for prosecuting him had passed, he never had to answer to any of them. Meanwhile, in any country you look at, only a small percentage of sex assaults ever get reported, a smaller percentage go to court and a tiny number result in convictions. To stand up in public and expose yourself to the hatred of someone who has already abused you, and the scorn of those who decided you were lying before you even opened your mouth, is a level of hell most of us will thankfully never know. So I salute the courage of psychology professor Dr Christine Blasey Ford who – despite admitting to being terried – told a US Senate hearing this week she believed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was going to rape her at a teenage house party in the 1980s. She claims the judge, Donald Trump’s conservative pick for the top US court, forced her on to a bed, tried to strip her, and covered her mouth to stop her screaming, leading her to fear suffocation. She was 15 at the time, he was 17. He says it never happened. Dr Ford earlier took a lie detector test, and passed. He has not taken one. Two other women have come forward to accuse Kavanaugh – one says he exposed his penis and shoved it in her face at a party. Another says he was present when she was gang raped at a party in the 1980s. He denies both offences.

The comet was first named after the spooky vegetable by scientists at NASA , after it flew past Earth on October 31, 2015.  Officially called the TB1456 asteroid, it came as close as 300,000 miles away from the planet back in 2015 - or 1.3 times the distance of the moon from Earth. It will be heading back this way on November 11, but is expected to be even further away and pass by at around 24 million miles away. This is about a quarter of the distance between the Earth and sun.  The asteroid has been described as a death comet, because it\u0027s believed to be a dead comet but also because of its unusual skull-like shape. First spotted by NASA\u0027s Infrared Telescope Facility  in Manua Kea, Hawaii, it\u0027s unnerving features were revealed on detailed radar images taken by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. In 2015, NASA said the comet was approximately 200ft  in diameter. At the time, Kelly Fast, IRTF program scientist at NASA, said: The IRTF data may indicate that the object might be a dead comet, but in the Arecibo images it appears to have donned a skull costume for its Halloween flyby.

It is hard to defend United manager Csaba Laszlo now and it would be no surprise  he is given his jotters after this most horric of days.It started when eventual hat-trick hero and former Tangerine Billy Mckay opened the scoring from close range on 11 minutes, knocking in a Josh Mullin cross.The only chink of light in the game came six minutes later as Pavol Safranko got on the end of Fraser Aird\u0026#8217s delivery to guide the ball past Scott Fox in the away net.From there United laboured and County took advantage. Scoring the most simple and avoidable goals \u0026#8211 often carbon copies of each other.The second came on 29 minutes after a Jamie Robson mistake played in Mullin to square for Mckay to knock in.On 41 minutes the same problems United had faced all game down their left-hand side were there for all to see as Sean Kelly inswinging free-kick went all the way through past Matej Rakovan in the home net. A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on 50 minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay\u0026#8217s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on 56 minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United\u0026#8217s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

We just seem to be falling short just now and it’s not good enough.“There’s nothing else for it, it’s the same old cliched stuff – you’ve just go to keep fighting away.“You need to be ready to go on the training field, pushing yourself to the max every day.“We have to put in the hard yards and that’s the only way it will turn.“I know the fans and everyone at the club is frustrated, they’re obviously used to seeing better times than this, but there is still time to get our season going.“That’s the only positive – there’s another game in a few days’ time, a massive game against Hamilton and we’ve got to go and make sure we get a victory.“I know, it’s easy saying that and the punters will be sick to the back teeth of people saying ‘next week, next week’ but it’s the only thing for it.”Hamilton against Dundee has been a grudge match over the past few years and last season at New Douglas Park was one of the stand-out moments for the Dark Blues as they came from behind to win the game in the 97th-minute through A-Jay Leitch-Smith.Kerr added: “Last season at Hamilton was amazing, an incredible finish to the game and that again was a resilient performance full of character within the group.“It’s dficult being positive after Saturday’s defeat and having no points from the first six games but we have to go there, knowing how hard it is down there, it’s an absolute dogfight.“They got a great result last week but it’s a game of football, 90 minutes, and  we get ourselves on top we can win the game on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5badf0a726d59.jpg ","title":"coffee giant starbucks plans to open second drive thru in

owns the entire site at Afton Way, say the planned shop would match the “signicant” growth of drive-thru coffee shops across the country.It would also serve a iety of people from passing motorists on the A90 through to nearby residents.The new proposal,  approved by Dundee city planners, would also create new jobs, and contribute to ongoing regeneration efforts in the North East.In a statement, representatives for Morrisons said: “The proposed small-scale drive- thru unit will form a complementary addition to the existing Morrisons store.“It will also generate a number of job opportunities for local people.”The application also hints at further development to come at Afton Way.Initial talk of an expansion on the site began as early as January 2013 – with other potential developments in

themselves an easier ride” at Hamilton on Saturday as they search for a first result of the campaign.The Dark Blues have endured a woeful start to the Premiership season, losing their opening six fixtures and scoring just twice.At the start of that run was also a 3-0 home defeat in the Betfred Cup to Ayr United, making it seven defeats on the trot.In none of those matches have Dundee managed to put themselves in front and their gaffer is desperate for the players to at least give themselves a chance of picking up a result.In order to do that, they’ll have to get the better of an Accies side high on confidence after a 3-0 thumping of St Mirren in match that has had a bit of extra spice over the past few years.And despite extra pressure on him to get the result, Neil still has faith in his side.He said: “It’s a huge game, they always have been against Hamilton.“The games against Livingston, Hamilton, Kilmarnock are going to be so important and then Hibs and Hearts.“We are still striving for that first win and we’ll keep trying to give everything to get ourselves that first goal that can at least put ourselves in a position to go and get that first win.“I still think that you could see in the first 45 minutes last Saturday, there is a team there.“I would just love to see them give themselves an easier ride by putting themselves in front.”The Dens gaffer is also hopeful of having some extra bodies back fit after a punishing injury-hit spell.Josh Meekings, Genseric Kusunga, Nathan Ralph and Sofien Moussa all missed the defeat to Hibs with injury while Kenny Miller was suspended.He’ll also miss Saturday’s trip to Hamilton while Kharl Madianga, Calvin Miller and Benjamin Kallman all added to the injury worries last weekend.The good news is winger Roarie Deacon is

dundee united boss is the hardest job in scottish football","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere were some cursory glances around the Press room at the Falkirk Stadium after Dundee United’s 2-0 win on Saturday when boss Csaba Laszlo, almost out of nowhere, asserted the following.“The most dficult job in the Scottish Championship, or Scottish football at the moment, is to be the manager of Dundee United.”He qualied that statement by adding that it is also dficult for his players to pull on the black and tangerine but his remarks did pique the interests of those gathered.It wasn’t so much disagreement or astonishment that filled the room but more a sense of being taken aback by the brutal honesty of a man who has been under such pressure of late.He eased some of the weight on his shoulders with the result at Falkirk under what were strange circumstances – namely going up against predecessor Ray McKinnon in the opposite dugout for a side sitting bottom and pointless.And it was clear that, despite assertions by some that Csaba is daft or clueless, he was very aware of the ramications had he not got the right result.“We showed good team spirit under pressure, they handled it positively,” Csaba commented as he laid out his case to the gathered press.“Now we can close this chapter and look ahead to the next game which will be very dficult.“This is the third season where the fans have been disappointed to be in the second tier and we are talking about a very massive, strong and passionate club that wants to be in Premiership.“If something doesn’t go right immediately you have noise which is OK but we don’t want to hide behind anything.“We have this pressure and we have to accept.“We don’t want to spend one more year in the Championship – it’s not good.“The Dundee United fans don’t want to hear that from the board, the manager or anybody. They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together. We had 19 players leave and 16 players come in for the new season.“We can’t click our fingers and have the team work fantastically.“There are rules at the club about how many or which kind of players we can bring in within our budget.“It is not easy, we are not Manchester City with an owner behind you who can give you £20 million to go and spend.“We have to work with the budget we have to get the best for the club.“The Dundee United board have done a fantastic job. It is not easy to convince players from abroad to come to the Scottish Championship with everything else around.”It was quite a defence – but probably one that was coming after weeks of trying to keep a lid on it following poor results against Alloa and Morton.Yes, he has not had his troubles to seek with injury and scrutiny from all angles but it seems to be just the beginning for Csaba in his most tough of jobs.In the next four weeks they take on title rivals Ross County, Ayr United, Partick Thistle and Inverness. They kick off that run at home to County on Saturday.“I don’t just look at one game being more important than the other because you can’t afford to take any game lightly,” Csaba added. “You have to take every opponent seriously, whether they be at the top, middle or bottom of the league.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Xplore-buses.jpg-940x562.jpg ","title":"xplore bosses apologise for disruption to dundee buses due to driver shortage","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBUS bosses have apologised following claims dozens of services have been cancelled in the last few weeks.Xplore Dundee says a shortage of drivers is causing serious disruption to routes throughout the city.One passenger claims he spent almost an hour waiting for a service as a result.The Tele understands dozens of cancellations have occurred, with many being announced on electronic boards at bus stops.Normal service is still to resume, but a spokeswoman for Xplore Dundee said they are “seeing improvements”.She said: “We’re sorry for the disruption currently affecting some of the services in our network and for any inconvenience caused to customers. We’re currently experiencing operational dficulties due to a temporary driver shortage. This issue is being actively worked on and we are already seeing improvements.“To keep passengers up to date, the real time information boards within shelters are programmed to show any change to services. All the relevant authorities have been informed of this situation and are being updated regularly on our progress.“Once again, we apologise for this short-term reduction in service and want to reassure customers we’re working very hard to resolve this as quickly as we can to resume normal operations.”A spokesman for the Traffic Commissioner’s office, which deals with complaints relating to bus operators, said they were aware of the current issues in relation to the punctuality of Xplore Dundee services but could not comment on a pending case.Back in June, the Traffic Commissioner fined Xplore Dundee £8,700 after repeated complaints about late and early-running services throughout the city.A report was submitted by Bus Users Scotland about punctuality failings and the services cited included the 9, 10, 15, 17 and 23 buses.The financial penalty was imposed after the Traffic Commissioner opted not to pursue a further investigation into the issues.One bus user, who wished to remain anonymous, said he found himself waiting almost an hour for a bus to Charleston last week. He said: “Journeys are basically going missing as far as I can see.“I have a family member who works for Xplore and it seems drivers are going off sick and they can’t replace them.“Myself and other people have been waiting up to an hour for buses – it’s shocking.“It was only the other week that I was waiting on a bus to go to Charleston and all I was seeing on the electronic board was that it had been cancelled.“The company weren’t able to send another one on and I was having to wait, that really shouldn’t be happening.“As far as I am aware this has been going on for quite a few weeks now. There’s no signs of it getting any better but something needs to be done about it.“I was informed that the Traffic Commissioner was aware of it so hopefully they will take it seriously.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"lewis-morgan-kris-boyd-hasnt-a-clue-whats-going-on-inside-celtic-weve-a-close-knit-group-of-players","story":"                          LEWIS Morgan has denied that Celtic have struggled this season due to a split in the dressing room - and vowed to play his part in helping the Parkhead club get back to winning ways."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-cabbies-set-for-new-compulsory-qualification-to-stay-on-the-road","story":"                          Cabbies could soon be forced to gain a professional qualication to remain on Glasgow\u0026rsquo roads."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-more-pupils-to-learn-cpr-as-8th-council-backs-evening-times-campaign","story":"                          INVERCLYDE has become the eighth council to commit to teaching all pupils le-saving CPR, in support of our Scotland\u0027 Got Heart Campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"                          OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the world\u0027s biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-woman-who-brings-the-biggest-stars-to-glasgow","story":"                          OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the world\u0027s biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair-cancels-250-flights-what-to-do-if-youre-affected","story":"                          Frustrated passengers were grounded on Friday after striking staff forced Ryanair to cancel around 250 flights, potentially affecting tens of thousands of customers across Europe."},{"url":null,"title":"everyman-cinema-glasgow-opening-date-announced","story":"                          A new boutique cinema will be opening in the City Centre at the end of next month."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-and-hamilton-jobs-to-go-as-powerleague-to-shut-two-sites","story":"                          WORKERS at two five-a-side football pitch complexes are facing the axe as Powerleague announced the closure of its west Scotland sites."},{"url":null,"title":"take-that-fans-left-disappointed-after-glasgow-ticket-fiasco","story":"                          Take That fans have been left disappointed after failing to get their hands on tickets for their greatest hits show."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-festive-old-firm-derby-date-confirmed","story":"                          THE final Rangers and Celtic clash of the year has been announced."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-tells-celtic-striker-leigh-griffiths-to-show-humility-with-his-celebrations","story":"                          Even as the goals start to come for Leigh Grfiths, there has still been a little rebuke from his manager."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-some-of-the-acts-coming-to-the-venue-over-the-next-year","story":"                          THE Eagles have announced they will  to the Hydro for their 2019 world tour."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"                          THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"                          AN English couple have decided to raffle off their \u0026pound3 million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117769.jpg","title":"Blainie 9 defies the odds in charity race","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn 2016, Blainie White  was diagnosed with a form of Batten disease which affects just eight people in the UK.

away win over the defending Premiership champions having triumphed 1-0 at Parkhead in the final game of last season.The pressure was on Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers following the defending champions worst start to a league campaign in 20 years.However the Hoops grabbed the three points courtesy of an improvised back-heeled goal from substitute Scott Sinclair in the second half.Aberdeen made two changes to the side which edged past Hibs 6-5 on penalties in a draining League Cup quarter-final clash at Easter Road on Tuesday evening.Striker Stevie May ed to the starting line up with Sam Cosgrove dropping to the bench.Northern International winger Niall McGinn also ed ahead of loan Derby County left-back Max Lowe.Celtic created the first opportunity in the second minute following a swt passing move that culminated in a  Mikael Lustig cut back to James Forrest but the Scotland cap\u0026#8217ss curling 15 yard shot flashed wide.The Dons threatened on the quarter hour mark when a corner kick swung in from the left was cleared as far as Gary Mackay-Steven at the edge of the box but the winger sliced his shot well wide.It was a cautious start from both sides who were showing mutual respect.Mackay-Steven was becoming increasingly influential on the left flank and burst down the wing in the 19th minute before crossing towards the far edge of the penalty area.McGinn raced in to meet Mackay-Steven\u0026#8217s delivery but  drilled a powerful 20 yard drive just wide.Moments later McGinn crossed into the box and it just agonisingly alluded the unmarked James Wilson eight yards in front of goal.Celtic were denied by the woodwork in the 25th minute when a curling effort from Odsonne Edouard from 25 yards beat ing keeper Joe Lewis only to crack off the far post.Aberdeen came close with a superb attack when Mackay-Steven drove at goal and stepped past two challenges inside the penalty box to open up a shooting opportunity.Keeper Craig Gordon somehow pushed it behind.From the resultant corner Andy Considine, who netted in the 1-0 win in May, rose to power in a header that beat Gordon but Leigh Grfiths was on the line to kick clear.In the 48th minute Dons keeper Lewis pushed a low drive from Callum McGregor wide for a corner.On loan Manchester United striker James Wilson fired in a superb 25 yard curling effort from the right only to be denied by Gordon\u0026#8217s ing save in the 52nd minute.Wilson was to come off on the hour mark to be replaced by Sam Cosgrove.Celtic went ahead in the 63rd minute when a ball from James Forrest into the box took a deflection that sent it spinning up into the box.Substitute Scott SINCLAIR used real improvisation and awareness to back-heel the ball into the net from six yards.It came at a time when Celtic were becoming increasingly frustrated and Aberdeen influential.In the 73rd minute Grfiths\u0026#8217 shot a free-kick wide of the defensive wall but keeper Lewis got down to block.The Dons should have equalized in the 75th minute when Mackay-Steven whipped in an intelligent free-kick towards the onrushing Mikey Devlin but with the goal beckoning the defender volleyed it wide.Deep into injury time Grfiths broke upfield and clearly pulled on the jersey of Devlin to gain an advantage. The referee waved play on and Grfiths raced upfield only to miss when chipping over the advancing Lewis.Aberdeen: Lewis, Logan, Shinnie, Considine, McKenna, Wilson, McGinn, Mackay-Steven, May, Devlin, Ball.Subs: Cosgrove , Lowe , Anderson Subs not used: Cerny, Forrester, Gleeson, Campbell.Celtic: Gordon, Hendry, Brown, Grfiths, Boyata, Ntcham, Edouard, Lustig, McGregor, Forrest, Tierney.Subs: Sinclair , Rogic , Morgan .Subs not used: Bain,  Gamboa,  Christie,  Mulumbu.Referee: Bobby Madden\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"boss has no worries over logan at celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen Dons boss Derek McInnes today insisted he has no concern about Shay Logan’s  to Parkhead.Defender Logan will today face Celtic for the first time since he was red carded following full-time of the Dons’ 1-0 win at Parkhead in the final game of last season.During his celebrations at the end of the Reds’ first league win at Parkhead since 2004, the 30-year-old clashed with Mikael Lustig and Dedryck Boyata before being shown the red by referee Craig Thomson.Right-back Logan was hit with a two-game suspension which the Dons failed to over-turn on appeal.Earlier this season, Logan alleged he was the subject of racist abuse from CelticMcInnes said: “Shay is not worried about it so I am not worried about it. Shay will be fine. He is quite unique in that he doesn’t let things bother him too much.“I felt what happened that day was all blown out of proportion and really unfair on Shay and he got a two-game suspension for that. We felt it was unfair at the time but we move on.”Logan missed the first three games of the domestic season as the two-game ban for the red card was added to a one-game suspension that had carried over from the previous season.The incident came four years after Logan was the victim of racial abuse by former Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev during a 2-1 loss in September 2014.Tonev, on loan from Aston Villa at the time, was hit with a seven-game ban by the SFA after being found guilty of the charge.Logan is set to start at Parkhead today as the Reds bid for back-to-back league victories at Celtic having secured that win at the end of last season.Meanwhile, McInnes has ruled out any move for former Manchester City and Aston Villa attacking midfielder Stephen Ireland.The 32-year-old had been strongly linked with Aberdeen in recent days. Although the transfer window has closed Ireland is available to sign for a club as he is a free agent having left Stoke City during the summer.He had trained with Bolton during the summer and was also a target for a number of German Bundesliga clubs.But McInnes insists there was never any chance of a swoop for the former Republic of Ireland international who has racked up more than 250 appearances in the English top flight.The Dons gaffer also insisted there will be no fresh additions to his squad before the winter transfer window opens on January 1.He said: “He  is a friend of Shay’s and it was really just a conversation with Shay.“There is nothing in that but it has grown arms and legs the last couple of days. I am happy with the squad and we need to get players back from injury as well“The squad is what it is and I am not looking to add to it. Hopefully we will get one or two back from injury over the next few weeks.“We have a few who are on the cusp of coming back and a few longer term.”McInnes has six players ruled out of today’s trip to Parkhead – Lewis Ferguson , Scott Wright , Frank Ross , Tommie Hoban , Mark Reynolds  and Greg Tansey .McInnes said: “Lewis is still out but will be back next week .“There are a couple of bumps and bruises from the other night at Hibs but nothing that will keep anybody out.“Niall McGinn’s groin has responded well.

It could be that one game that means they follow a team for the rest of their le.Asking thousands – tens of thousands – of people, families, to travel across Scotland at outrageous times just so they can follow their team in their quest for that glory is simply not acceptable.SPFL addresses critics of semi-final scheduling\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/spfl-addresses-critics-of-semi-final-scheduling/embed/#?secret=nNJ0I0GqU1\" data-secret=\"nNJ0I0GqU1\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220SPFL addresses critics of semi-final scheduling\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"For the SPFL to say this is “the best solution to a logistically-challenging situation” is absolute rubbish.Who is it the best solution for? An organisation which has admitted inheriting a deal from the now-defunct SPL which means games featuring the Old Firm or that will attract more than 20,000 must be played at Hampden?One thing is for sure – this is not the “best solution” for the supporters.Fans from across the north-east and beyond will not want to miss Aberdeen’s first Hampden clash against the Gers since the Scottish Cup final of 2000.Given the performances of the two clubs in recent times, it’s one of those occasions where it really is dficult to predict a winner.It’s one of those must-attend games.But the fact is, playing the game at this time could give Rangers an advantage  Aberdeen fans rightly choose not to make the ridiculous journey.Yes, there will still be thousands of Aberdeen fans willing to make the journey to Glasgow for the club’s eighth lunchtime kick-off for a semi-final in 10 years and they should be applauded for their dedication and willingness to travel.It doesn’t mean those who don’t make the journey are no less of a supporter, but there is a higher chance of a better attendance and atmosphere  the game was at a reasonable hour.This is about more than just Aberdeen fans being inconvenienced. Hearts fans have equal right to be upset.Clearly Edinburgh is closer to Glasgow and the travel links between the country’s two biggest cities are good. The same cannot be said about Glasgow and the Granite City.SPFL boss Neil Doncaster urged to ‘rethink’ League Cup scheduling and put fans first\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/spfl-boss-neil-doncaster-urged-to-rethink-league-cup-scheduling-and-put-fans-first/embed/#?secret=sWpl1rVf4r\" data-secret=\"sWpl1rVf4r\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220SPFL boss Neil Doncaster urged to ‘rethink’ League Cup scheduling and put fans first\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"Aberdeen fans wanting to get the train – which we are always encouraged to use to aid the environment – simply can’t because it won’t get to Glasgow on time.For ScotRail to confirm it was not contacted by anyone from the SPFL until after the fixtures were announced\u0026#8230 well, there are no words.We know it’s the price of success and not one person would convince us that “it’s only a game” and doesn’t matter in the long run. Anyone who says that is wrong.Why should a club’s fans be punished for their team doing well? Derek McInnes says it makes no odds to his team where and when the game is played and he’s right. The players will still travel when they need to and stay in a hotel to ensure their bodies are in tip-top condition for the match.ScotRail slams SPFL over League Cup scheduling\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/scotrail-slams-spfl-over-league-cup-scheduling/embed/#?secret=CTficSBvtE\" data-secret=\"CTficSBvtE\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220ScotRail slams SPFL over League Cup scheduling\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"But what is the point in going to all those efforts  they are going to have the disadvantage of playing in front of a stadium which is predominantly filled with Rangers fans?Craig Levein said Neil Doncaster and the SPFL will be to blame  his team’s game isn’t a sellout. He’s right.Jambos keen to take in their club’s first Hampden semi since beating Celtic on their way to Scottish Cup glory in 2012 face a tough decision.Hundreds,  not thousands, of children who were excitedly told by their parents “we’re going to Hampden!” after the thrilling 4-2 win over Motherwell in midweek will face the heartbreak of being told they can’t go.Those same parents will now have to sit their youngsters down and explain  why they are now not going to the national stadium.Even Hearts players have been saying to Levein how their kids can’t go and watch them play at Hampden.What sort of message is that sending out to the next generation of fans? Why should a cup semi-final which is being played on a Sunday be scheduled for such an awkward time?It’s little wonder with bizarre decisions like this that across the streets of Scotland we see kids wearing replica jerseys of teams they have only seen on TV. What is the point in supporting a Scottish team  they are going to have such ridiculous hurdles put in front of them?They would be as well staying at home that Sunday and watching Crystal Palace v Arsenal and Manchester United v Everton on Sky Sports – and that’s without even taking into consideration the games from foreign shores that will be elsewhere on Sky and BT that day.The suggestion from Aberdeen to change the Premiership clash between Celtic and Hearts at Parkhead the following week from a league game to their semi-final makes sense. But perhaps that is the problem. Few things in Scottish football do make sense, be it the issuing or rescinding of red cards on the field to having the country’s four biggest clubs play in the same city on the same day, let alone at the same stadium. The mind boggles.It seems that as long as the teams and people from Glasgow are happy and treated well, then we should just sit back and be grateful to have them in our league. What nonsense. It’s our national game. National. It’s about time the football authorities started treating it that way.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scholarships see trio given a helping hand","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east businessman and his family have donated more than £270,000 to a university medicine and business scholarship programme.The Aberdeen University Cormack Family Foundation Scholarships was founded by Dave Cormack, his we Fiona and daughter Dr Sarah Cormack-Patton.Now the first wave of scholars benefiting from the foundation have been introduced.Dave said: “It felt like a natural option to combine business and medicine for the foundation.“With my background in business, I am very passionate about giving young people the opportunity to start a career in the field, and we are very aware of how important encouraging young people to go into medicine is.“We want to encourage people from schools in less well-off areas to believe they are able to do anything. We have also found that people from these backgrounds are often more likely to engage with communities as doctors.”The three young people to benefit from the scholarship are Seb Siegrist, 20, Diana Pituc, 18, and Marielle Tulloch, 24.Seb, from Keith, was in care throughout his childhood and is now studying medicine at Aberdeen University.He said: “I left school when I was in fth year and began working. I then went to college in Aberdeen before beginning pre-med and eventually ending up here.“I was always interested academically but I think for kids in foster care, it’s unusual to end up in an academic field – there are only 300 kids in care at university across Scotland.“I don’t want to just be a doctor – I want to be a really good doctor and use my background to relate to my patients who otherwise might feel they can’t talk to their doctor.”Diana, who is originally from Romania, moved to Aberdeen when she was 14 and attended Northfield Academy. She is now studying medicine.She said: “I didn’t have the best background. I just never felt that university was an option for me.“When I began at Northfield my teachers were amazing. They were so supportive and I felt they made my dream possible.“I have always wanted to be able to help others so to be studying medicine is amazing.”Marrielle, from Turrf, is studying for a degree in accountancy. She said: “I started working at 14 and first did an HND at college in fashion.“I then went into first year at Heriot Watt but because I have a chronic inflammation condition, I had to drop out. Afterwards, I decided I wanted to do something more stable and so I chose accountancy.“I went back to college and did my HND and then got accepted into Aberdeen University.“I’ve never been confident in my abilities and I never thought I would get to where I am now.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teams goal is to net funding","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen football club is hoping to score a share of a cash grab to pay for new equipment.The East End Lewis 2005 group has taught its players, some as young as five years old, the rules of the pitch and now it is hoping to land funds from CommunitEE Chest’s £15,000 cash pot.The group, now in the under-14s category, is made up of groups from East End and Lewis United Youth which merged their youth football teams.Anna Yeats, a parent of one of the players, said: “The team is always needing money for trips, equipment and referees.

It’s funny because I’ve always said through the years that I struggle with my doubles.“But in the major event where you need to hit two doubles in a leg – it’s been my most successful major.“It would be brilliant to get through. I got such a buzz out of doing well last year.“Michael was the best player in the world when I beat him and he’s World No 1. Daryl is the favourite and will have the crowd on his side and be on a high as defending champion.“This is the start of the busy run up to the World Championships so a nice little run in the Grand Prix would set me up well.“Hopefully I can go better than last year, get to the final or even further – it’s a tournament that’s provided upsets so hopefully I can provide a few more this year.”Some have billed tomorrow’s clash as the chance for Hendo to get revenge after the 4-1 defeat in the semi-finals 12 months ago.But he sees it dferently and has beaten Gurney since their meeting in the Grand Prix.At the World Championships last December Hendo caused a stir by eliminating Gurney 4-2 in the second round at the Alexandra Palace.Hendo added: “Daryl beat me last year, but then I beat him at the end of last year in the World Championship.“If the doubles go in for me then I feel I’ve got a great chance and he’ll be saying the same.“People are talking about revenge for last year, but I don’t look at it like that.“It’s another game against the World No 5 and I’m the underdog, which I prefer to be, and I’m hoping to win.”Hendo also takes confidence from having another good season on the PDC’s Pro Tour, with good results helping him climb the rankings to 27th.He said: “I’m playing well. I had a great end to 2017 and I’ve carried that on.“I’ve had a couple of good runs in Pro Tour events.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max.

He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby. He is now planning to have a break from competing for the rest of year to give the car a well deserved rest and some TLC.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rocky start for mid argyll rfc in first round in scottish schools cup","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 11/09/18, 8:45 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe team scheduled to play Mid Argyll Rugby Club\u0026#8217s under 16s in the first round of the Scottish Schools Cup pulled out on the morning of the game \u0026#8211 but local school pupils saved the day.Duncanrig School should have played the Mid Argyll youngsters at Lochgilphead Joint Campus, but cancelled at the last minute.A team made up of Lochgilphead high, Tarbert Academy, Campbeltown Grammar and Islay high schools was quickly formed to play as South Argyll Schools  for this cup competition.Coach Lee Buckley said: ‘As the Islay school boys were already on the ferry over for the fixture, we decided to play a development game between the 22 SAS squad members at the joint campus.‘Everyone put in an amazing effort and this session could be key when the team plays Marr College in the second round of the cup.’The team also struggled to find a pitch to play another home game on recently as there are no suitable rugby pitches in Mid Argyll.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a sweet way to raise zambian money","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/09/18, 10:17 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe coffers of a Mid Argyll charity were boosted by the aroma of fresh coffee and lemon drizzle cake.People were drawn to Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall on Saturday September 15 for a fundraising coffee morning with plenty of home baking.The two-hour event raised £335, which will help ZamScotEd  with its work in Zambia, where it is completing a secondary school in the Lusaka area.The charity\u0026#8217s founder, Marian Pallister, said: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who helped us achieve this fantastic sum of money.\u0026#8217PICS:Four-year-old Lily with baby Natalie and mum Annie Galloway from Lochgilphead enjoying a cuppa and a cake. 06_a38ZamScotEd01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mojo 4 below","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 19/09/18, 6:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOctober is almost here, and that means so is MOJO 2018But  all you music makers, shakers and fans cannot wait until the big night, check out the MOJO Facebook page for demos, more information on each of the acts and their inidual social media accounts.4 Below is the new alternative rock creation of Oban musician, Andy Bruce.Taking up music in his teens, Andy initially learnt bass playing within a musical group of friends gaining lots of experience with bass.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past 24 years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op.32 No.12 as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer?Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse/harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills 2,000 years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead \u0026#8211 now wasted \u0026#8211 would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year\u0026#8217s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall \u0026#8211 this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £700 at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers \u0026#8211 Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £915.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior/1st male \u0026#8211 Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: 1:10:40Female Senior/1st female –Lucy Fraser 1:15:05Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club 1:17:55Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club 1:10.19.42Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – 1:12:48Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club 1:23:34Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – 1:19:30Female Vintage  – Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club 1:38:22Male Super Vintage  – Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club 1:25:001st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend 1:19:441st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin 1:16:28The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of 1 hour 12 minutes and 56 seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage category  put in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage 70+ age group and won by over 20 minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the 12-mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage race  Alan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at 8 minutes and 9 seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the 40+ veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by 20 seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of 25 minutes 33 seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a 31 minute 7 second run being 10 seconds quicker then Phil Dye and 30 seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteran  female category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veteran  category saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of 1:16:28, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at 1:20:51 and Iain MacNicol in third place 1:23:56. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at 1:19:44, in second place was Sarah Grfin at 1:21:33 and Louise Gibson at 1:25:34 in third place.\u0026nbspTeam EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were 13 teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of 7 minutes 52 seconds, followed only 20 seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only 20 seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction 4.0, ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘40 Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.\u0026nbspThanks, and Feedback\u0026nbspMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

There was something for that Orange is the New Black fan, some Riverdale-style Serpent jackets spotted, and the 80s horror genre is still alive and well, ironically.This year\u0026#8217s convention featured a lot of zombies in costume and in the events.

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding.

He and his we had three daughters.\u0026#8217Margaret Sillars Fullarton, born in 1885 and died in 1962, was the postmistress near the harbour, according to Mr Forrest.Sarah Morton Fullarton, born in 1882 and died in 1970, married farmer Thomas Ralston in 1915.In 1894, Mr Forrest\u0026#8217s grandmother, Agnes Elizabeth Fullarton, was born.A son, Wylie Fullarton, was also born but died at a young age.Mr Forrest said: \u0026#8216My grandfather, William Whitter, born in 1889 and died in 1951, moved to Campbeltown from Ashton-in-Makerfield, near Wigan, to work in the Customs and Excise Inspectorate with Archibald.\u0026#8216Being of a similar age to his youngest daughter, they became friends, marrying in 1918.\u0026#8217Following the decline of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s distilleries, the family moved to Glen Elgin, Morayshire, where Mr Forrest\u0026#8217s grandfather worked at Glendronach and Glen Elgin distilleries.The couple had two children: Mr Forrest\u0026#8217s mother, Agnes  Elizabeth Whitter, born in 1921 and Austin Fullarton Whitter, born in 1924.Nancie and Austin served in the Wrens and RAF respectively, before ing north and qualying in medicine.\u0026#8216My uncle, who piloted gliders into Arnhem, combined his love of flying with his degree and emigrated to work for the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia,\u0026#8217 said Mr Forrest.\u0026#8216My mother was a plotter at Harwich and was very proud to have patted Winston Churchill on the back on VE Day.\u0026#8216On her  to Aberdeen, she met my father at a medical meeting and the rest, as they say, is history.\u0026#8217Mr Forrest is looking for some information about his great aunt, Sarah, who had two sons, Thomas Millar Ralston, born in 1917, and William Ralston, born in 1919, with her husband, Thomas.\u0026#8216I would imagine that Ralston is not too common a surname, and there are two Ralstons that feature in the centenary publication \u0026#8211 J Ralston as a local dignitary in a photo of volunteers going off to the Boer War, and the foreman printer at the Campbeltown Courier in 1973, R.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.  Representatives from many organisations he was associated with, including Musselburgh Rotary Club, Musselburgh Air Cadets and Fisherrow Yacht Club, were present to pay their last respects."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-for-volunteers-to-join-the-team-at-musselburgh-cab","story":"  Claire Grehan, volunteer support officer, said sometimes there could be three or four volunteer advisers on duty but the busy High Street office was down to just one that day. The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday, October 14.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

It was recognised as a provisional Olympic sport in 2016 meaning it will receive funding just under \u0026pound20,000 in annual funding from the International Olympic Committee.  The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

The youngster has been playing since he was just five years old.  The two coaches put the Dunbar Primary School pupil forward because of his good attitude and commitment to the sport.  The trip to Glasgow\u0026rsquos Emirates Arena, where Great Britain won 3-1 with Norrie, ranked 70 in the world, winning 6-2, 6-2, 6-0 to settle the encounter, gave Ben a taste of the big time, with the youngster playing in the East Lothian Open earlier this summer.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.

It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful.

They found about the historical link from Ian Wood, former sub-postmaster at Levenhall, after he spotted information online about the four-time Open winner.  Mr Wood said: \u0026ldquoIt made mention that he died at Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoWhilst I knew a little bit about golf history and its strong links with Musselburgh during my 15 years, up until 2014, as sub-postmaster there, this was the first mention I\u0026rsquod seen of the Willie Park connection to Levenhall as opposed to Musselburgh and the Old Course.  \u0026ldquoI use the Scotland\u0026rsquos People website run by the National Records of Scotland in my local and family history research so quite quickly found Willie\u0026rsquos death registration in 1903 together with the Park family entry on the 1901 Census: both at Laurel Bank, Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoI knew the house owners as former customers so when I next saw them I mentioned what I\u0026rsquod discovered and expected them to know about it, particularly as Andrew, like me, is a keen golfer. However, this was news to him and his we Audrey so I passed them copies of what I\u0026rsquod found.  Mr Inglis made contact with Historic Scotland which supported his request to have the plaque installed on the front of their house.  And Mr Inglis, who has lived in the house 34 years, said: \u0026ldquoWe are quite proud to tell people about it. It is good to support Musselburgh\u0026rsquos heritage and do everything you can to attract people to the town.  \u0026ldquoI have been up to the loft to see  there are any of Willie Park senior\u0026rsquos putters but there are none!

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now. He has also become a leading light in the Musselburgh Athletic FC\u0026rsquos 1934 Club.  Alistair was a director for 20 years of the now defunct Musselburgh Fair Day Association which ran the annual trotting at Musselburgh racecourse. He also ran a youth club for a number of years in Northesk Church and was chairman of the Musselburgh Domino League for a few years.  In August,Yard of Ale played a fundraiser for Musselburgh Athletic Football Club to help them achieve their transition to senior football.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.  University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.  But what was troubling them more was the \u0026ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.  The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.  But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.  They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death?  It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.  It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.  Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents? Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.  Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, for  it had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.  They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in 1603 which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.  It was written into statue by an act in 1609.  The Act called on all \u0026ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and \u0026ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .  And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.  When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.  It said there was a need to set an example to \u0026ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.  It continued: \u0026ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children \u0026ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.  The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be \u0026ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.  They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.  They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in 1624. They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living \u0026ldquoas  they were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be \u0026ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.  The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of 1609 was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other \u0026ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.  Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.  And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.  Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.  The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.  But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy/traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared \u0026ldquonon-settled lestyle.  But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.  They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didn\u0026rsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.  I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about \u0026lsquoTinks\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoGypos\u0026rsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.  The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not \u0026ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.  It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud \u0026ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.  It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the 1609 Act and made my spine shiver.  I didn\u0026rsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.  I\u0026rsquom ashamed about that \u0026ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"  The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

A planning design and access statement, submitted on behalf of the company, stated: \u0026ldquoThe restaurant will be designed with on-site and drive-through facilities for vehicles, cycles and pedestrian access, with internal and external areas to enjoy refreshment for the passing traveller, as well as for the local community in the Fisherrow Harbour locality.  Also planned is parking, new service lanes and a new landscape plan for the site.  The statement added: \u0026ldquoIn terms of local economic benefit it is expected that the project will support a number of additional local part time jobs at the site when operational and there will also be additional employees on site during construction.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed drive-through coffee shop is intended to supplement the existing petrol filling station\u0026rsquos  to serve the needs of passing motorists whilst providing useful services to the residential and commercial communities in and around Musselburgh, contributing positively to the site\u0026rsquos public realm offer.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will create a place which is welcoming and distinctive by virtue of its design.

It follows a successful bid to attract volunteers to join the community project which is expected to take two years to complete.  Andrew Crummy, the artist behind the Great Tapestry of Scotland and Battle of Prestonpans Tapestry, spoke at a recent event in the Old Town Hall as did Melissa Viguier from the School of Ancient Crafts.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which took place between Wallyford, Musselburgh and Dalkeith on September 10, 1547, has been described as the largest and bloodiest conflict ever fought on Scottish soil.  It began after the English king Henry VIII\u0026rsquos attempts to secure an alliance with Scotland through the marriage of his young son Edward to the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, failed.  Part of a conflict known as the Rough Wooing, it is considered to be the first modern battle in the British Isles and a catastrophic defeat for Scotland.  Now the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group is working with Mr Crummy to make sure the last pitched battle between Scottish and English armies, in which 10,000 were killed, is not forgotten.  The tapestry will be loosely based on the Marian Hangings stitched by Mary, Queen of Scots. Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.  The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured \u0026pound10,000 from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry. Chief stitcher Liz Neilson and her team will lead the work.  Volunteer stitchers are welcome to attend future workshops at the Old Town Hall from 10am to 1pm on October 13 and 27, November 10 and December 8.  Alister Hadden, treasurer of the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group, said: \"We were delighted with how well attended the launch event was.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"Historian Sir Tom Devine on what really happened during the clearances","story":"  \u0026ldquoWe started going on holiday to the Highlands in the late 1960s, early 1970s and you could still see the traces of dispossession very clearly, Professor Sir Tom Devine explains. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos what\u0026rsquos so interesting when you go to the west coast and the Hebrides, that the marks of this extraordinary process of historical revolution are on the land.  The visual scars of the Highland clearances he saw half a century ago, the ruins and abandoned townships, had a profound impact on Sir Tom personally and professionally, inspiring much of the work he has undertaken since. And the fruits of this labour have been brought together in a ground-breaking new book that not only adds to our knowledge and understanding of the clearances north of the Highland Line, but also sheds new light on how dispossession impacted on the rest of Scotland.  Indeed, the volume challenges the narrative many Scots have told themselves and others for centuries: we will surely never again be able to refer to the destructive events of the 18th and 19th centuries as the \u0026ldquoHighland clearances.  The name of the book, The Scottish Clearances: A History of the Dispossessed, 1600-1900, highlights Sir Tom\u0026rsquos central premise that what occurred was a deliberate and nationwide process that affected lowland areas as much, arguably more so, than the Highlands. At the heart of the narrative is an evidentially robust but also often grim and very human story of how Scotland was transformed from the rural society of old to the largely urban nation we know today. The end of traditional Highland le is here, warts and all, but crucially so too is the far less well-known story of the demise of an entire class of lowland folk, the cottars.  \u0026ldquoOne of my main arguments is that the scale of land loss was greater in lowland Scotland and that the scale of landlessness at the end of clearance was also greater, explains Sir Tom.  \u0026ldquoWe all know about urbanisation but in terms of Scottish culture, the sheer scale of the revolution is not recognised. In early 18th century Scotland most people living outside the towns and cities of the lowlands and Borders had access to some land because to be without it in that subsistence society was to court survival itself.  \u0026ldquoBy about 1820 in the lowlands and Borders, the landholding society that had existed since time immemorial, including the quarter to a third of old rural population who were cottars, had vanished.  As Sir Tom points out, while the wounds around clearance, dispossession and forced emigration remain painful in the Highlands, recognised and revered around the world, kept alive and passed on through families and communities, there has been no such process of grief or remembrance for the lowlands.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been interested in puzzles, he says. \u0026ldquoOne of the big questions is this: why in many parts of Scotland did the dog not bark in the night? With the exception of a levellers\u0026rsquo revolt in the 1720s the process in the rest of the country was silent. There is no folk memory of dispossession and that led many people to think nothing had happened, that the whole thing was concentrated on Gaeldom and the Highlands, where it is still a live issue.  \u0026ldquoThe clearances are something everybody thinks they know about. This book is an attempt \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquom glad to have been the historian to attempt it, because it\u0026rsquos been absolutely stimulating \u0026ndash to rewrite a central aspect of a nation\u0026rsquos history. It\u0026rsquos very unusual for a scholar to be able to do that, especially your own history.  Sir Tom believes English popular historian John Prebble, whose best-selling 1963 book The Highland Clearances is the sole source of many people\u0026rsquos knowledge of the subject, has much to answer for in terms of the mythmaking and politicisation that continues to surround this period of history. His new book tells a far more complex - but in many ways no less dramatic \u0026ndash story that covers improvement as well as loss.  \u0026ldquoPrebble and I share the same publisher and it was only while going through the Penguin archives that I discovered his book on the clearances is almost certainly the biggest selling on Scottish history of all time, says the Lanarkshire-born author and academic.  \u0026ldquoIn his terms the Scots are an ancient warrior race betrayed by their leadership class and pushed off their lands. That kind of human experience, that kind of story, is very attractive. It\u0026rsquos got a psychological impact that is dficult to dislodge.  \u0026ldquoBut the historian\u0026rsquos role is to be impartial and get as close to what happened and why it happened as possible. People interested in Scottish history in north America still see it through the prism of Prebble\u0026rsquos works. I quote in the book a fth-generation Scottish Texan lady who hired a genealogy firm to find out where she was from and discovered, like most 19th century immigrants, she came from lowland Scotland, in fact my own place of birth, Motherwell. She was not only displeased but for a time refused to pay them. She wanted Skye, and above all else she wanted a cleared township in Skye.  It will take time to wean north Americans off their overwhelmingly romantic view of Scottish history. But this is a book that is likely to ruffle feathers closer to home, too. Are we Scots ready to face and reassess our prejudices about the clearances?  \u0026ldquoYou get the sense that the Scottish nation is now a more confident and sophisticated place, says Sir Tom. \u0026ldquoPeople may be able to treat the arguments I put forward seriously, without indulging in outrage and invective against the author. I\u0026rsquove made the evidence base as armour-plated as I can because I know this is going to touch sensitivities, not least in Highland Scotland.  This latest 400-page tome joins the list of definitive \u0026ndash and also thoroughly entertaining \u0026ndash texts written by the historian over the last 40 years, a canon of modern Scottish history that covers rural society and urbanisation, the impact of Scots migrants across the globe, and Scotland\u0026rsquos role in the Empire and slavery, that is devoured and appreciated by academics and wider society alike at home and abroad.  We meet in a hotel in Glasgow\u0026rsquos George Square, a short hop from the City Chambers, where he has come from recording an interview for BBC Radio 4 on the city\u0026rsquos slave history. The 73-year-old is also a familiar face on television, his engaging, accessible style having made him a vital and popular source of information, anecdote and analysis for programmes on everything from land reform to Balmoral Castle.  Speaking of which, what does he make of popular TV history presenters such as Neil Oliver and Dan Snow? An eyebrow lowers and the hint of a wry smile appears across the Devine features.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not impressed with these people because they can\u0026rsquot be basing what they say on camera on deep knowledge and insight. They\u0026rsquore not scholars. There are plenty of telegenic young historians who could do the job very well indeed.  That\u0027s not to say Sir Tom isn\u0026rsquot rather worried about the future direction of his profession, detecting a \u0026ldquoserious weakness in the current generation of historians researching Scottish history post-1700.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be more risk taking in order to start to revise, or at least confront, some of the big issues. My generation is passing away, the next generation should be daring to question us.  \u0026ldquoScholars should be prepared to be in direct interrogation of other people\u0026rsquos work. My subject can only grow  people are prepared to challenge those who went before or are still writing. There\u0026rsquos not enough of that.  Sir Tom has spent much of his le challenging accepted historical narratives during an academic career that has spanned half a century at the universities of Edinburgh, Strathclyde \u0026ndash his alma mater - and Aberdeen. Earlier this year he was awarded the Letime Achievement Award in Historical Studies from the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on History and Archives at Westminster, the first historian from a Scottish institution to receive the award. In 2014 he was knighted.  Not bad for a boy from Motherwell who no one expected to be born at all, after his mother suffered a slew of miscarriages and his elder brother, Michael, died of spina bida two months after birth. According to family folklore his grandfather, an Irish migrant to Scotland like all his grandparents, spotted early promise in young Thomas.  \u0026ldquoFollowing my brother\u0026rsquos death, people didn\u0026rsquot think there would be any more wee Devines, says the historian, who lives in Hamilton. \u0026ldquoThen I came along and apparently one day raised my head from the cot \u0026ndash it must have been wind \u0026ndash and grandfather declared in his Irish brogue \u0026lsquolook at that boy already trying to sit up, he\u0026rsquos going to be a professor!\u0026rsquo In those days that was the acme of all achievement.  His childhood interest in history was initially sparked by military topics \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoat 12 I asked my parents for the memoirs of Field Marshall Montgomery \u0026ndash but he dropped the subject at secondary school in favour of geography.  He talks of the post-war period in which he grew up as a \u0026ldquogolden age in terms of social progress \u0026ndash he eventually swung his allegiance back to history as an undergraduate at Strathclyde university in the 1960s \u0026ndash and is troubled at statistics showing a stark reversal in social mobility.  Indeed, that is one of the reasons he believes vehemently that free undergraduate university tuition should continue to be offered to all young people.  \u0026ldquoIt makes Scotland distinctive and gives the impression that the democratic instinct is still alive \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos very important, he says. \u0026ldquoWhen I went through university we got subsistence and travel allowances, too. I simply cannot countenance behaving in a dferent way with the current generation. They are living in a very dficult world. We, the baby boomers, owe them.  Indeed, when I ask whether he is optimistic about the future, he shakes his head sadly, while conceding he has always been a \u0026ldquoglass half empty man. But this pessimism is clearly down to circumstance as well as personality.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that someone like Trump could be elected by the most powerful nation on earth is a fearsome metaphor. Then you go to Westminster and find the most maladroit UK government since the mid-19th century.  Then there\u0026rsquos Brexit. At the very mention of it he grows agitated. We both laugh out loud, however, at the absurdity of my asking what he thinks will happen in the coming months.  \u0026ldquoThe future is not my period, he answers. \u0026ldquoBut two months after the Brexit vote I said it wouldn\u0026rsquot happen. And I think the chances of it not happening are now greater than ever. I\u0026rsquom not saying it\u0026rsquos more than 50 per cent but there are possibilities. It will be a disaster for Scotland \u0026ndash indeed for the UK \u0026ndash  we have to leave without a consensual agreement.  The possible ramications for Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional position are not lost on the scholar, who wrote widely about and voted in favour of independence in the 2014 referendum. He has not changed his mind.  \u0026ldquoThe irony,  Brexit did happen, especially with no agreement, is that it would be a vital force in making for a new vote for independence. If [no deal] didn\u0026rsquot happen, it would be much more dficult to mount a challenge to the union.  And does he have any words of counsel for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as pressure mounts from more eager elements of her party and the pro-independence movement for another referendum as soon as possible?  \u0026ldquoIf one could suggest advice to someone with so much responsibility, I\u0026rsquod say keep the powder dry until the situation with Brexit is known and make extensive preparations in private or a secluded way to prepare for a possible referendum, he says. \u0026ldquoWe saw that in some ways with [former MSP Andrew Wilson\u0026rsquos] intellectually honest growth report.  \u0026ldquoBut  there is an attempt down this route over five, 10, 15 years and it failed, there won\u0026rsquot be another one for a very long time.

Pupils enrolled in Higher English are increasingly choosing to study horror films instead of more traditional literary texts.  The Scottish Qualications Authority  said classic literature such as Shakespearean plays were still by far the most common choice alongside works by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.  But the SQA said: \u0026ldquoAn increased number of candidates chose to write their essay on a media text.  \u0026ldquoIn this genre, popular choices were the films The Dressmaker, The Shining, The Sixth Sense, Psycho, The Prestige, Shutter Island and Pleasantville.  The wider trend towards films is also apparent in National 5 English qualications, with ten per cent of pupils choosing films including The Dark Knight and Psycho.  Author Raymond Soltysek, a former teacher and co-ordinator of the Scottish Association for the Teaching of English, believes the trend is a positive one in a world where most communication is delivered through some form of visual medium.  And he argues that studying a film rather than a book is just as complex and rewarding.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are saying to pupils that what they have before them is a text and the fact they are watching it rather than reading it is really immaterial.  \u0026ldquoPupils still have to use a whole range of literacy skills to understand and interpret it so, just as in a printed text, they would have to look at metaphor and simile, characterisation and setting.  \u0026ldquoGiven the vast majority of people in western society now get their messages in some kind of visual form it is really important that we recognise that.  Mr Soltysek said the use of films in Higher English, which was established more than 20 years ago, would grow, but it would never replace literature. And he dismissed suggestions it was an \u0026ldquoeasy option.  \u0026ldquoThe core of an English teachers work will always be literature, but I have alway avoided film because it has been too hard for me to do.  \u0026ldquoIt requires an awful lot of technical knowledge of filmmaking skills that I find dficult. I would much rather teach Shakespeare than a film to any level of pupil.  Dr David Sorfa, a senior lecturer in film studies at Glasgow University, said films and the moving image more widely deserved their place alongside classic literature.  He said: \u0026ldquoEven great Shakespeare lovers basically know his works from film and television.  \u0026ldquoThey may have half red Hamlet when they were forced to at school or university, but, like Shakespeare, a lot of our knowledge about history, literature and the world comes from cinema and television.  \u0026ldquoThe sense that film or even television is in some way a lesser art form or something that isn\u0026rsquot as interesting is wrong because it opens up the world of literature which can be very closed to young people.  Dr Catriona Miller, senior lecturer in media policy, history and theory of film at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the horror genre had always been associated with teenagers as far back as Gothic literature.  She argues such films serve an important purpose because they help teenagers decode who they are.  She said: \u0026ldquoTeenagers are dealing with an emerging sense of self in terms of who they are and who do they want to be and, at the same time, they are having to negotiate who they are inside and what do they want to show the world.  \u0026ldquoThat is tough and scary to deal with and the horror genre deals with a lot of these questions in a very direct way, but with the added safety net that it is not real.  \u0026ldquoYou can risk staring the monster in the face and how to deal with it because it is not a real thing.  Ms Miller does not believe films like The Shining, which is rated 18, are too scary for teenagers, arguing they crave a real fright rather than one which is \u0026ldquodesigned for them.  \u0026ldquoSome of the films that are made specically for teenagers are not actually scary enough. They have to feel a real sense of jeopardy.  Filmmaker and critic Mark Cousins also welcomed the greater use of horror films.  He told the Times Educational Supplement Scotland: \u0026ldquoThese are works of art which allow pupils to engage with deep questions of fear and identication. It\u0026rsquos snobbery to suggest that great horror cinema shouldn\u0026rsquot be used in teaching."},{"url":null,"title":"craig-levein-blasts-the-spfl-and-claims-i-have-never-seen-so-much-disregard-for-fans-in-my-life","story":"  He accused SPFL bosses Neil Doncaster and Iain Blair of not caring about supporters, his own club, Aberdeen, the people of Glasgow, families and the Hampden pitch. Had Roy Keane been in in the room he may have felt it his duty to ask Levin to calm down.  Derek McInnes said his piece in Aberdeen a few hours later and while he didn\u0026rsquot miss his mark, his words were almost lost due to his counterpart in Edinburgh, in a coherent fashion, offering up his opinion on the league and Hampden\u0026rsquos joint decision \u0026ndash so we are led to believe \u0026ndash to play both Betfred Cup semi-final on the same day at the national stadium, with his side facing Celtic on the evening of Sunday, October 28, and Rangers and Aberdeen going first at noon.  Levein said: \u0026ldquoIn all my time in football, I have never seen such disregard for supporters in any situation. If you could find a way to inconvenience people, then this is the perfect way to do it. It\u0026rsquos a shambles, honestly.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom angry. It\u0026rsquos a disaster for the supporters, particularly for us and Aberdeen. There is human stuff.  Austin MacPhee has spoken to a few of the players and they are frustrated.  \u0026ldquoThey want to enjoy the experience and they want to take their families to Hampden for a semi-final. If is 7:45pm on a Sunday night that is not going to happen as kids won\u0026rsquot be going as they have school the next day.  \u0026ldquoEvery Hearts supporter, whether it be a mother and father taking their kids or grandparents taking their grandchildren - brothers or sisters - these matches are supposed to be family occasions. I\u0026rsquom not even going into other things which could be unmitigated disasters. You\u0026rsquoll have 100,000 people in Glasgow, not all drinking but one or two will be.  \u0026ldquoAnything could go wrong. You\u0026rsquove got the pitch situation, possible damage to toilets which has happened in the past. There is a list of things which could go wrong. If any of those things do go wrong, Scottish football will be tarnished by it. Why are we asking for trouble? It\u0026rsquos just madness.  Hearts have one of the largest travelling supports in Scotland, renowned for making it to Hampden in large numbers when they reach finals and semi-finals. Levein fears a Sunday evening kick-off will prevent thousands from making the journey to Glasgow.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have to ask for 50 per cent of the tickets for the Sunday night, that\u0026rsquos only fair. We have to give our supporters the opportunity to go. The fact is, it\u0026rsquos unlikely we will sell them all - we might only sell 15,000.  \u0026ldquoBut I\u0026rsquoll tell you something: This will fall squarely back at the feet of Neil Doncaster and Iain Blair. If the people don\u0026rsquot come, then that\u0026rsquos their fault. It\u0026rsquos nothing to do with the supporters and it\u0026rsquos nothing to do with us. It\u0026rsquos a joke of a decision.  With Hearts due to travel to Celtic Park on November 3 on league duty, Levein insisted he would be more than happy to delay the semi-final tie for a week.  He said: \u0026ldquoHere\u0026rsquos the thing: Our competitive advantage is Celtic playing on the Thursday night in Europe. We don\u0026rsquot have a midweek game  but I\u0026rsquod give that up now to swap the fixtures so we could get a memorable occasion at Hampden.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot care about the competitive advantage. I want our supporters to be there so it feels like we\u0026rsquove got the backing of the Hearts fans.  And then, of course, there is the thorny subject of playing one of the semi-finals away from Hampden.  Levein said: \u0026ldquoWhy are we contractually obliged to play at Hampden? They haven\u0026rsquot even asked to be released from this contract. Is that not the first thing you would do  you are trying to find an alternative?  \u0026ldquoAt least ask the question. Murrayfield could easily have accommodated one of these games easily. I will play anywhere but I want the Hearts supporters to be there in as big a number as possible and to enjoy the experience.  McInnes described the treatment of their fans as \u0026ldquoreally unfair and wondered why it always seemed to be Aberdeen punished the most.  McInnes said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not surprised because it seems to be the way time and time again. Any requests or complaints we have about that situation doesn\u0026rsquot seem to be working or affective.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping that everybody, while their first reaction may be \u0026ldquostuff it I\u0026rsquom not going or a retaliation to the league, it\u0026rsquos important we go there together with a huge support and try get the result on the day.

Dr Graham Hawley said in a statement issued on September 12 that he was \u0026ldquodeeply disturbed by these allegations and I take them very seriously. The alleged behaviour is unacceptable. It is everything that we are not.  Hawley contacted parents today to inform them that McLean-Steel\u0026rsquos employment had been \u0026ldquoterminated.

For legal reasons, it is not appropriate that I make further comment on this.  The headmaster told parents he has begun a recruitment process to find a new head of drama.  He also urged parents to contact him with further concerns.  When the allegations emerged Hawley said he had alerted the Care Inspectorate.  A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said today: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of an alleged incident at this school and are satisfied that the school have responded appropriately.

In a Record column last year, Ms Dugdale accused Mr Campbell of making a homophobic remark about gay Tory MP David Mundell - something Mr Campbell vigorously denies.  The development comes amid growing ision in Scottish Labour over the party\u0026rsquos decision to end funding to Ms Dugdale, and criticism of current leader Richard Leonard.  Many in the party are appalled at Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos apparent failure to stand up to Labour HQ on Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos behalf.  One source said: \u0026ldquoPeople are starting to wonder  he\u0026rsquos spineless or powerless. It\u0026rsquos probably a bit of both. He could pick up the phone to Jeremy Corbyn at any time, but he seems to think he won\u0026rsquot be listened to.  Clare Lally-Steel, Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos Carer\u0026rsquos Champion under leader Johann Lamont, publicly announced on Friday that she was leaving the party over Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos treatment.  She tweeted: \u0026ldquoThis makes me weep!! I am appalled that the Labour Party have treated her like this after everything she has done \u0026amp continues to do. This was the final nail for me, I will be cancelling my membership.  But the pro-Corbyn Campaign for Socialism said it supported the withdrawal of funding.  \u0026ldquoThe use of vast amounts of money to fight a court case that was triggered by an MSP in their own private column is neither prudent nor fair, it said in a statement.  After Mr Campbell, 50, launched a defamation action at Edinburgh Sherf Court, the Record initially offered to support Ms Dugdale, but Labour took over the case.  Ms Dugdale says then general secretary Iain McNicol agreed all her costs would be met.  However earlier this month, with the legal bill approaching \u0026pound100,000, new general secretary Jennie Formby pulled the plug.  It left Ms Dugdale facing large fees to carry on, as well as potentially ruinous costs for Mr Campbell\u0026rsquos damages and expenses.  It is understood the Record\u0026rsquos support for Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos defence is step-by-step, starting with an appeal against a recent sherf\u0026rsquos decision to hold an evidential hearing, and does not cover damages and expenses  she loses.  Ms Dugdale, a Lothians list MSP since 2011, this week said she felt \u0026ldquocrushed and suffered one of her \u0026ldquolowest personal moments when she heard Labour had ended its support.  She said she feared she would be made bankrupt and be disqualied as an MSP.  She also revealed she had texted Mr Corbyn about the matter, but he had not replied.  Ms Dugdale opposed Mr Corbyn becoming UK Labour leader, and her supporters suspect the end of the party\u0026rsquos legal support is connected to her lack of support for Mr Corbyn.  Amid accusations of a \u0026ldquobetrayal, and facing calls to reverse the decision in a high-profile vote at the party conference in Liverpool, Labour bosses this week agreed to reconsider the decision, referring it to the National and Scottish executive committees.  However this is likely to take several weeks.  Labour defended its action, and said party funds were better spent on campaigning,  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoKezia Dugdale has received signicant support from the Labour Party. The Party has a responsibility to all our members and that must mean spending our members\u0026rsquo fees responsibly and appropriately.  \u0026ldquoWe have to present and campaign around our message of hope and the need to Rebuild Britain and that is where we believe our members wish to see their fees spent."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook-security-breach-all-you-need-to-know","story":"  What happened?  In a post on the social network\u0026rsquos news site, Facebook vice president of product management Guy Rosen said a security breach affecting 50 million users had been discovered on Tuesday.  While the investigation is in its early stages, the firm said the hackers had exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\u0026rsquos code involving the \u0026ldquoView As feature, which lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else.  In a later post, Facebook said the vulnerability had arisen from a combination of three distinct bugs, which meant the hackers were able extract other users\u0026rsquo access tokens \u0026ndash the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to the Facebook app.          Sharing more technical details about the security issue we announced this morning https:t.co/JgOIeSNfjQ          \u0026mdash Facebook  September 29, 2018  It explained that when using the \u0026ldquoView As feature, the code had not removed the box that allows people to wish friends a happy birthday and incorrectly provided the opportunity to post a video.  In turn, the video uploader incorrectly generated an access tag that had the permissions of the Facebook mobile app. The third bug meant that the access token generated was for the user being looked up, instead of the person doing the viewing.  Pedro Canahuati, vice president of engineering, security and privacy, said: \u0026ldquoThe attackers were then able to pivot from that access token to other accounts, performing the same actions and obtaining further access tokens.  Who was affected?  Facebook has not revealed whether any UK users were hit, or where the hacked accounts were based, only saying that it had affected almost 50 million of its more than two billion users.  Mr Rosen said the attack could have given the hackers access to other apps  a user had logged into them using their Facebook name and password \u0026ndash and said the firm was investigating whether there was any access to Instagram accounts. He confirmed, however, that WhatsApp was not impacted by the breach.  What has Facebook done?  Facebook says it has already fixed the vulnerability and has informed law enforcement of the attack.  It has reset the access tokens of the hacked accounts, as well as another 40 million accounts that have been subject to a \u0026ldquoView As look-up in the last year.  As a result, around 90 million people were having to log back in to Facebook, or any of their apps that use Facebook Login.  What should I do to protect my account?  Following the announcement of the breach, Facebook issued guidance on the next steps to take.  While some accounts have been automatically logged out, no one needs to change their passwords, the firm said.  Those who were not logged out automatically, but want to log out as a precaution, should visit the \u0026ldquoSecurity and Login section which lists all the places a user is logged in to Facebook.

Findlay Lockie, a lawyer and \"restorer of houses\", has bought the severely dilapidated mansion, and while he spends the next ten years turning into a family home, he has made a long term deal with a noted arts company, which will use the estate\u0027s wood to hold a series of open-air \"augmented reality\" shows.  One of these shows - Quest for Oz, inspired by the works of Wizard of Oz writer Frank Baum and staged by formerly Leith-based company Vision Mechanics, led by director Symon Macintyre - will begin next week.  Vision Mechanics will now be based in the \u0027big shed\u0027 next to Drummohr House and plan to stage their events in the woods for the coming years, as well as using the shed as workshop and arts space.  : The Dragons of Drummohr  The 34-room Drummohr House dates from the 1740s, when the Dalrymple family built it as a summer home, a replacement for a previous house that had been burned to the ground by Jacobites.  After changing hands, and having architectural additions added, it fell largely into disuse after its last year as a full working farm in 1918.  Since then it has been used as a monastery, an outbuilding for the nearby Loretto School, a hotel and a care home.  Mr Lockie, who says he is the \"opposite of a developer, because I am going to reverse what has happened to the building in the last 100 years\", said he is delighted that its 10 acres of woods, until recently overgrown and full of rubbish, will be home to arts events.  Mr Lockie, 60, has spent nearly 20 years restoring Northfield House in Prestonpans, which is now on the market.  He said: \"I knew about this house for 30 years, and its ious iterations, but I was taking my son to nursery and we saw it and looked in - it was clearly derelict, but a sleeping beauty which demands some attention.\"  The house has dry rot, and much of it is not habitable, with no wiring or plumbing: however inside the large drawing room, which the Dalrymples used for dancing and entertaining, is still in place.  : Neil Cooper on Vision Mechanics\u0027 Little Light  After settling a series of complicated land ownership issues - with several parties owning the surrounding land - Mr Lockie is now the owner.  On the land near the main house is a substantial shed, and it is here that Vision Mechanics will be based, a large space where they can manufacture and stage shows, as well as hire out space for other artists.  The shed will be the home of the Emerald City for the new show.  Mr Lockie said: \"Symon was my dream partner for this.  \"We had two imperatives - one was to restore the house, the other is the financial one...and so the big questions was, what to do with the big shed? I thought do we really want to use it for storage, and then I met this wonderful man - through a Scottish reel group - and we talked about his amazing artistic endeavours.  \"He lives in the arts world, a dferent world from mine, but I am starting to understand it now, and he came for a walk in the woods - and the woods had been neglected for 35 years - and we became excited.  \"It turned out Vision Mechanics needed a new home, so it is a ten year agreement, but I hope it is a 20 year agreement.\"  Mr McIntyre said the deal was a \"marriage made in heaven.\"  He said: \"What really excited me was the potential of the woods, and although they needed clearing up - we removed four skips of rubbish - they have a great atmosphere.\"  : The work of Vision Mechanics  Quest for Oz uses installations, lighting, and other effects to create a \"part game, part immersive theatrical storytelling, part art \u0026amp sound installation.\"  It runs from October 4 to 28 and it aimed at a family audience, and its organisers expect 5,000 people to visit.  It has been funded by Creative Scotland, East Lothian Council and Event Scotland.  Mr Lockie added: \"If we combine this with interested, artistic people are here and working every day, the shed is being maintained and these events are taking place which are creating an aura around the house, then the house is no longer a derelict, a liability, and a blot on the landscape.  \"I don\u0027t want people to think it is now a public park - it is a private house - but we seem to have reached this combination exactly right, because there is interesting stuff going on from time to time, and people can see the house is being brought back to le.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-is-jeopardising-the-tories-reputation-as-the-party-of-economic-competence","story":"  The snapshot of entrepreneurs and executives revealed that just 26 per cent felt the party was \"pursuing business-friendly policies\" while 57 per cent disagreed.

The survey of more than 1,000 people carried out for the People\u0027s Vote, which wants a second Brexit referendum, found that even those whose businesses did no export trade with the EU were split 50-50 in terms of Leave versus Remain.  Among those whose turnover was more than 10 per cent derived from EU exports, it rose to 70-30 in favour of Remain.  Overall the split was 59-41 for Remain, with a similar split, 57-43, supporting a new referendum once \"don\u0027t knows\" were removed.  Mr Grieve, the former Attorney General and pro-Remain MP who backs another vote, said: \"This poll highlights the extent that the Conservative Party is jeopardising its reputation for economic competence with the business community as a result of the way Brexit has unfolded.  \"This should be a wake-up call because our party is risking everything for which we have always stood.

That being said, even  the aim is not so noble, new guidance could still have a positive effect.  This isn\u0026rsquot really new guidance or a Scottish Government production either though. It is mostly links to work by other bodies \u0026ndash the United Nations, the Institute for Human Rights and Business, the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark Initiative and others.  Make no mistake, these are certainly useful resources, but by doing little more than signposting to external initiatives it is not clear what exactly the government is asking of its agencies providing these handouts. It\u0026rsquos impossible to avoid a feeling of this being no more than lip-service to dampen the bad press they\u0026rsquove received weekly as a result of our work.  Along with its reliance on links to other bodies, the wording of the guidance itself indicates that it is not compulsory. In its few pages, it only sets out recommendations and describes its own content as advice.  The language itself is not definitive. It suggests what kind of assessments should be conducted, but also states that the detail of what is checked is ultimately a matter of judgement by whomever has initiated the relationship. Due regard for human rights seems to rely more on agencies deciding themselves to follow the external links provided than on any clear instructions from the Scottish Government.  I\u0026rsquove asked the government to explain exactly what status this guidance has and provide copies of any human rights assessments recently carried out, to give us a clearer picture of what\u0026rsquos going on. Given the lack of transparency we\u0026rsquove faced so far, going as far as an Information Commissioner ruling that they breached Freedom of Information law, I expect this will take months yet again.

A strong performance across several key indicators has seen the University climb 14 places from 40th to 26th in the UK rankings - the biggest move by a university that appeared in last year’s top 40, which placed it on the shortlist for UK University of the Year.  It is the University\u0027s third successive rise in the rankings.

The Guide has also acknowledged the University’s world-leading medical research, which was recognised earlier this year when Aberdeen was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize - the highest national honour for a UK university.        Other areas of strength include the University’s role in supporting the local and national economy through its energy-related teaching and research activities, recently demonstrated by the creation of a National Decommissioning Centre.The Guide has also taken into account Aberdeen’s activities in areas of importance including widening access, investment in facilities, student welfare, and internationalisation – the University opened its first overseas campus in Qatar last year.Professor George Boyne, Principal, said: “This is a major honour and a testament to the efforts of our staff and students, as well as the great sense of identity and community that we have at Aberdeen.“As an institution we consistently attract students with exceptional ability and potential, and this - along with the quality of our teaching - has been an important factor in our success in areas such as degree outcomes and graduate employability.                                                                                                         “In addition, our strength in research - exemplied by the Queens Anniversary Prize for our contribution to health services research - places us at the forefront of innovation in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.“This University was founded in 1495 with the purpose of being open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others, and this continues to inspire our academic achievements.“Our focus on widening access and inclusivity, strength in interdisciplinary teaching and research, and international outlook are the modern-day interpretation of our founding principles, which have played a major role in Aberdeen being named Scottish University of the Year.“I’d like to congratulate everyone at the University who has worked so hard to help us achieve this honour.”                                                                                                        Alastair McCall, editor of The Sunday Times Good University Guide, said: \"Aberdeen\u0027s sharp rise up our league table this year is the biggest of any university in the top 30 and gives it a ranking commensurate to its status as one of the UK\u0027s leading academic institutions.\"It was a clear winner of our Scottish University of the Year award and earned a shortlisting for the UK University of the Year title off the back of improved performances in most of the metrics used in our tables.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Sunday 30 Sep 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

Because of the sharp turn from River Street up the Clf Road the lorries are required to reverse all the way up from Wick harbour after the blades are loaded on their trailers by crane. They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Sunday 30 Sep 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 29, 2018 at 2:51 pmOrkney Football Club ed to winning ways this weekend, overcoming Tain St Duthus in a five-goal thriller.

They can, however, be utilised to directly counter the issues they once caused.\u0026#8220An empty home brought back into use as a primary residence represents another family in the community, potentially more children in local schools, and more money spent at local businesses.\u0026#8221The document is available at http:www.orkney.gov.uk/Council/C/empty-homes-strategy-consultation.htm and is under consultation until Wednesday, October 24, at 5pm.Any comments should be submitted to Rachael Bowes, Empty Homes Development Officer via email rachael.bowes@orkney.gov.uk.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

However Scottish Water has been in regular contact with stakeholders and I will wait to hear the assurances given to the community next week.\"The event will run between 3.30pm and 7.30pm on Monday.Share your views on the proposals by emailing newsdesk@spp-group or writing to us at the address on our letters page.Sunday 30 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgSunday 30 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would close  the new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed store\u0026rsquos grounds \u0026ndash another 6000 sq ft building and one covering 2500 sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for 79 cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the future  the site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: \u0026ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shop\u0026rsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move \u0026ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community council\u0026rsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new \u0026pound4million care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community council\u0026rsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: \u0026ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Street  allowed. The care home  has set a precedent so can\u0026rsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: \u0026ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care home\u0026rsquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar panels was incomplete and that some \u0026ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, \u0026ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: \u0026ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar panels.Mr Black offered an apology for the audit\u0026rsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: \u0026ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and it\u0026rsquos costing us a lot of money. That can\u0026rsquot be changed unless we\u0026rsquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to \u0026ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: \u0026ldquoThe council\u0026rsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. It\u0026rsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that \u0026lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive year\u0026rsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.\u0026ldquoPerhaps I shouldn\u0026rsquot be surprised.

It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.            The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland  will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.            Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what. A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species. This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.            Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century. They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat. Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.Bats are not actually blind. However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously. It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.            The organisation has even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.  Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.“Here at Threave we have a great area for bats,” he said.“We’ve got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.“But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”            He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population. Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help. She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know how their populations are faring.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802756.1537444466!/image/image.jpg","title":"iconic edinburgh detective rebus makes his theatre debut","story":"        Ian Rankin\u0026#8217s most famous character takes centre stage tonight in Birmingham in a play adapted by Rona Munro. Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

It is where direction is set, policy is \u0026#173formulated, and political leadership is given, based on the everyday lived experiences of people in workplaces, and communities right across the country.                It is the forum where ideas are exchanged and tested – and nowhere is that more the case than at conference fringe events, such as The World Transformed series, held in a brewery converted into a ­theatre space just a few miles from the main conference venue.            It is always a pleasure and a privilege to participate in this ­cauldron of ideas – and this week was no dferent. The fringe ­meeting was chaired by Ed Miliband and included economic thinkers ­Martin O’Neill and Grace Blakeley, and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy.             Some of the ideas were radical, like the call to revolutionise the UK banking system. Others were reconnecting with Labour’s socialistic traditions, like economic democracy and co-operative ownership, whilst yet others looked to a future built on automation, new science and reduced and shared working time. That these ideas were aired at the conference fringe was perhaps not exceptional, that they found a ready echo in platform speeches in the main conference hall was.It was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell who embraced much of this radical thinking, converting it into concrete policy proposals for an incoming Labour government. In his main address, he outlined plans to increase public ownership, including building a new frontier of worker ownership. He pledged to establish a Public and Community Ownership Unit in the Treasury. The unit will bring in external experts to advise on and implement the transfer of PFI schemes out of the private sector. That means public services will once again be owned by the public, because ­people have had enough of being ripped off by privatisation.His plans for the private sector also include action to clamp down on the industrial scale tax avoiders who are denying our hospitals, our schools and carers of the resources they need. Mobilising shareholder power to demand that companies uphold basic tax justice standards and ensuring that they meet the Fair Tax Mark standards is a central part of this approach.In a bid to rebalance power in the economy, he has outlined ­proposals to promote employee ownership in larger companies through share issues.This has some resemblance to the ideas designed by Hans Meidner in Sweden some years ago – an approach which I have championed for some time. In most European economies these ideas are mainstream – and it is a measure of how desperately our country needs real change that they are considered by some to be “left-field”.            In my main address to conference, I built on this radical thinking and applied it to Scotland, because it is clear we need Scottish solutions to Scottish problems and Scottish challenges. So, for instance, there is no Scottish Government ­industrial strategy. We need one with an enhanced role for workers and their unions in a more planned approach to the Scottish economy. Taking water back into public ownership is a pressing demand in England, but – thanks to a ­dramatic intervention by Labour in the then Strathclyde Regional Council, who famously ran a referendum to oppose water privatisation with a 71 per cent turn out and a 97 per cent rejection rate in the 1990s – we don’t need to take water into public ­ownership here. But that is not to say though that we may not need to reform the lines of its accountability and democratic oversight. One area where we ­definitely need change is on the long-standing question on the ­ownership of land. Fewer than 500 landowners own half of all private land in Scotland. To find more just land solutions means we will have to give some consideration to tax ­measures, ownership limits and residential qualications. We should certainly take the railways into public ownership, and look at the ownership and provision of bus and ferry services. With so much of our economy over dependent on overseas ownership and foreign direct investment – meaning it operates largely a branch plant – we need to look urgently at what we can do to rebalance economic ownership. One way is by taking the lead on measures like a statutory right for workers to own the company that they are employed in when it is put up for sale or facing closure. Such a boost to co-operative and employee ownership would ­relocalise ­control and lock in more local accountability.             Scotland is, after all, the birthplace of the first workers’ co-operative, in Fenwick, Ayrshire, and became the home of father of the co-operative movement, Robert Owen. Rebalancing the distribution of financial instruments like regional selective assistance to target investments by indigenous rather than overseas businesses is also the right thing to do. So the idea of a world transformed is therefore central to the mainstream thinking of the party. These policy proposals are not made in the abstract, but in the real-world context of Brexit, the May Government’s failing negotiations and the growing likelihood of a UK general election in the next few months. This week, John McDonnell said: “The greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be the greater the need for change, the greater the opportunity we have to create that change, and we will.”As this week underlined, a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is up to that challenge and in Scotland the radical economic and social programme that the people need is finding new vitality and relevance.         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806731.1538130515!/image/image.jpg","title":"port of cromarty on crest of a wave","story":"        The Port of Cromarty Firth has recorded its best ever year after turnover jumped by \u0026#1631 million, helping to fuel further investment.                Annual turnover rose to £9.9m – the highest in the port’s 40-year history, new figures have revealed.            Bosses said the strong financial position would enable the business to continue to invest in major developments, such as the new quayside and laydown space, which is in the planning stages to be built through the next couple of years.            The past year was described as an “extremely busy one” for the port, which saw it ersy from its core business of oil and gas to renewables, decommissioning and cruise.Chief executive Bob Buskie said: “At the start of 2016, with low oil and gas prices, we knew the port had to adapt to sustain our growth and help keep local people in work.“Firstly, supporting our core customers in oil and gas was a key concern. After the necessary consultation, we introduced a new pricing for statutory dues in January 2017, which meant an average 5 per cent reduction in fees for most clients, supporting them through the downturn.  “Secondly, the port had to look to the future and see what we could do to help sustain jobs and growth. This is where our ersication strategy came in, with 2017 seeing us undertake a project to introduce decommissioning to the port in an open port policy, where our supply chain could bid for work under our licences.”Cruise continued to be a success story in 2017, with the port being named as the busiest in Scotland. In another record-breaking year, the facility welcomed 93 ships and more than 150,000 passengers to the Highlands. This represented a 54 per cent increase on 2016.            The direct spend from these passengers was worth more than £15m to the local economy and provided a boost to a range of attractions.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807389.1538254567!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit damaging tory reputation for economic competence says dominic grieve","story":"        Brexit is jeopardising the Conservative Party\u0026#8217s reputation as the party of \u0026#8220economic competence\u0026#8221, Dominic Grieve has warned, after a poll of business leaders showed low support for its trade policies.                A poll of entrepreneurs and executives revealed that just 26% believed the party was “pursuing business-friendly policies”, with almost one in six  disagreeing.            Two-thirds  said they regarded the Conservatives as traditionally pursuing policies that “increase prosperity and help well-run businesses”.            : MP data leak after Tory conference app security failureThe survey of more than 1,000 people carried out for the People’s Vote, which wants a second Brexit referendum, found that even those whose businesses did no export trade with the EU were split 50-50 in terms of Leave v Remain.Among those whose turnover was more than 10% derived from EU exports, it rose to 70-30 in favour of Remain.Overall the split was 59-41 for Remain, with a similar split, 57-43, supporting a new referendum once “don’t knows” were removed.Mr Grieve, the former attorney general and pro-Remain MP who backs another vote, said: “This poll highlights the extent that the Conservative Party is jeopardising its reputation for economic competence with the business community as a result of the way Brexit has unfolded.            “This should be a wake-up call because our party is risking everything for which we have always stood.“Those sections of the party which are guided by the ideology of Brexit have only served to damage the ability of the Government to get any positive outcome from these negotiations.”YouGov polled 1,004 people for the People’s Vote between September 18 and 26.More than four in 10  said le had become harder for their business since the referendum, with just 9% saying it had become easier.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807343.1538245523!/image/image.jpg","title":"women s football shows drink and gambling the red card","story":"        The grassroots body for women\u0026#8217s football in Scotland has vowed to keep the game \u0026#8220clean\u0026#8221 in the face of overtures from the alcohol and gambling industries who are courting it for sponsorship deals.                Big companies are queueing up to get involved in the women’s game, with the stock of the Scotland Women’s national team at an all-time high given the recent qualication for next year’s World Cup in France and their participation in last year’s UEFA Women’s Championship.             However, Vivienne MacLaren, the chair of Scottish Women’s Football, told Scotland on Sunday the organisation that looks after domestic competitions has “knocked back” sponsorship deals from alcohol and gambling in the past and will continue to do so. This is at odds with the men’s game, where all the major competitions in Scotland are sponsored by betting companies, including the Ladbrokes Premiership, the William Hill Scottish Cup and the BetFred Cup.            Last week the Scottish Football Association  and drinks company Diageo launched a campaign to promote responsible drinking. They hope to reach a million Scots with the Drink Positive campaign. The initiative will use the William Hill Scottish Cup to encourage fans, coaches and players to be aware of the effects of alcohol and to encourage moderate drinking.MacLaren said she understands why clubs in Scotland take sponsorship money from drink and gambling giants, given they are the only ones with substantial budgets to spend on football. But she is quick to stress the women’s game is striving to offer a dferent proposition.MacLaren said: “In Scotland alcohol and gambling are two of the biggest scourges. A massive percentage of our members registered to play football are under 18, so we feel we have a real duty to make sure the brands we are associating with and the message we are putting out are positive ones.“We don’t want to take money when there’s girls playing football out there who can’t afford to get to training. We’re trying to help clubs support their players.There’s kids that can’t afford football boots and yet there’s alcohol and gambling brands around a lot of sports.”            The Scottish Government announced additional funding for the national team squad ahead of next year’s World Cup, which will allow them to train full-time.MacLaren said: “For us to bring in dferent types of sponsors we have to position women’s football as a dferent proposition. It’s a partnership, it’s about education.“We want to give something back to the players and the volunteers that play and help week in, week out.” Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland and a vehement critic of the SFA link with Diageo, said: “Alcohol marketing should have no place in sport.             “By linking their brands to sports events and teams, alcohol companies imply that drinking is part of a healthy and active le. In fact, alcohol is a cause of cancer, heart disease, liver disease and stroke and was responsible for 3,705 Scots losing their lives in 2015.”Dr Peter Rice, chair of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems, warned: “Research has shown high levels of alcohol brand awareness among 11 and 12-year-old children in the UK, and much of this awareness comes from sports sponsorship, especially football.“The advertising regulation codes written by the alcohol and advertising industries themselves say that advertising should not associate alcohol with fitness or sporting success.“These codes are designed for broadcast and media advertising, but sponsorship clearly achieves the same marketing goals for companies and we believe is used to get around regulation.“It would be unacceptable to have a beer advert in a magazine aimed at children, yet children see Champions League games ‘brought to them’ by a beer company.            “This is an inappropriate association and we would ultimately like to see the end of it in football, and we commend the Scottish women’s game for their leadership.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Signatures will be collected in the village for petitions \u0026ndash to present to Macdonalds at a later date \u0026ndash and at the resort which is currently staging the prestigious Europarc conference being attended by some 500 delegates.\nA key theme of the gathering is Scotland\u0027s Year of Young People 2018, It was highlighted at the meeting this was at odds with denying local tots, children and teens access to the pool.\nAfter the meeting, SOS 2018 coordinator Joe Kirby said: \"It was a really productive meeting with lots of great ideas coming forward from those there.\n\"There was a clear feeling within the room that we need to raise the campaign\u0027s profile and get both parties talking again so that the community can get back to using the pool.\n\"We will be starting with a peaceful show of support for affordable local swimming at the resort and in the wider Aviemore from early evening and there are plenty of more suggestions which we have taken on board and will be looking to develop over the coming days and weeks.\n\"Our sincere hope, however, is that both parties can reach an agreement very soon: that way everyone is a winner \u0026ndash Macdonald Hotels, Highland Council and the community.\"\nIt is understood to renew the High Le Highland deal the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for \u0026pound200,000 in year one \u0026pound213,000 in year two and \u0026pound223,000 in the final year.\nEarlier this month a three-year deal agreement had been struck in principle via email exchanges only for the local authority to see that the hotel company did a U-turn.\nIt would have seen Highland Council pay \u0026pound180,000 with index linked increases either CPI or 2.5 per cent and HLH users pay \u0026pound1.50  or \u0026pound3 per family per visit over the three-year period\nThe council has said the deal will give Macdonald Aviemore Resort approximately \u0026pound220,000 per year \u0026ndash more than the hotel operator had been looking for at the outset.\nMacdonald\u0026nbspHotels\u0026nbspconfirmed they intend to reopen talks next week.\nA spokesman said: \"We remain keen to see this situation resolved, which would be in everyone\u0026rsquos interests \u0026ndash especially those local people who are unable to enjoy use of the pool.\n\"However, we\u0026rsquove been consistent in stressing that any compromise must be on the basis that the scheme is financially sustainable, taking into account the very signicant rises in costs we have had to meet.\n\"Over the past two years alone, the resort has seen staff costs rise by 20 per cent to \u0026pound4.6 million, a 22 per cent increase in energy costs to more than \u0026pound1 million and a 55 per cent jump in business rates, which are now over \u0026pound590,000 annually.\n\"In an attempt to overcome the impasse, we will be making contact with the council early next week to see whether we can resolve this unfortunate situation.\n\"But it\u0026rsquos clear that any reasonable, long-term solution needs to take these hard facts into account.\"\n\nSunday 30 Sep 2018 2:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117758.jpg","title":"Highland search for Calum","story":"Tom Ramage\n\nPolice in Inverness are continuing with enquiries to trace Calum Anderson who has been reported missing from his home in the city.\nThe 29-year-old - also known as Malcolm - was reported missing from the Culduthel area of the city on Sunday, September 23.\nThe most recent confirmed sighting of him is at the Asda supermarket shortly after 2pm on that day.\nExtensive enquiries are ongoing to trace him and officers are urging anyone who can help to get in touch as soon as possible.\nChief Inspector James Rice said: \"As times passes we naturally grow increasingly concerned for Calum\u0026rsquos well-being.\n\"We know that he was seen at Asda in the Slackbuie area around 2pm but we have no confirmed sightings of Calum after that.\n\"Calum is known to walk extensively.

It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived.

All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212-\n\n\nArticle by Adam Gordon\nAll images by Willie Urquhart.\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview \n Ruairí Doyle\n\n“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TD\nSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. \nHe also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. \nSpeaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.\nThe Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the 1980’s. \nThis informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, even  it were 40 or 50 years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.\nPearse, who has been a TD since 2010, talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. \nThe Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. \nHe said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,  I am in thatposition.”\nSinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.\nPearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. \nThis is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”\nHe continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €2.5 billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”\nAs Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.\nDeputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  \n“What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  \n“It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”\nTouching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.\nPearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. \nHe continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  \n“And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”\nSinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. \nThis Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. \nTeachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athome  that’s what they wish.” \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046476.jpg--.jpg?1537863861000\n","title":"par ful good effort for dementia charity","story":"  \nBallymena Golf Club did par-ful well by raising \u0026pound5,130.00 at a Charity Golf Day event for Dementia NI.\n  \nThe even saw approximately 136 golfers in 34 teams take to the greens on a superb sunny day .\n  \n The overall ladies winner was Elaine Mark and the overall men’s winner was John Devlin.\n  \nBallymena Golf Club members Noel Gourley and partner Evelyn Allen gave their support leading up to and during the event, securing sponsorship, taking photographs and running a raffle at the evening prize-giving.\n  \nFionnuala Savage Income Generation Manager Dementia NI said:\n  \n“Thank you so much to everyone who supported the Ballymena Golf Club charity day and raised \u0026pound5,130.00 for support local people living with dementia. \n  \nToday, it is estimated that there are currently 20,000 people across Northern Ireland living with dementia.

Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E.

Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E.

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"\nA spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.\n\n                \nThe church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Church\u0027s Harvest service\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church.

We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. \n\n“There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nMinister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.\n\n“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOf the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.\n\n“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”\n\nThe Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October 7 at 11.30am and 7pm.\n\nRev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from 3pm to 6pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”\n\n

At a crucial juncture in the Brexit negotiations it is hugely important that we sustain and build further links, cooperation and engagement across all of Ireland. I have no doubt the Seanad will be keen to hear what the Mayor has to say and continue to play our part in supporting the work of councillors across the country.\n\n“The memorandum between Belfast and Dublin city councils can act as a positive catalyst for cross-border relations and delivery. Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"\nTHE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted 6000 responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.\n\nMr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September 29 and working to see  institutions for dealing with the past up and running.\n\nCampaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over 6000 responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”\n\n“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on 5th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.\n\n“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now.

What is the point of that, what will we have done?\n\n“And I think there is still time for her to change course.”\n\nThe former foreign secretary, who quit the Cabinet in July, argued for a new withdrawal agreement dubbed “Super Canada”, which says the Irish border question will be settled as part of the deal on the future economic arrangements.\n\nNumber 10 hit back at his proposal, with a source pointing out Mr Johnson had been part of the committee that agreed the need for a customs backstop in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDavid Gauke \n\n\n\n\nMr Gauke warned that a Canada-style deal could have grave consequences for the union.\n\nHe told the i newspaper: “If we end up with an arrangement whereby Great Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, and Northern Ireland stays in the single market and customs union, then over time Northern Ireland will become more and more integrated into the Irish Republic’s economy and less integrated into Great Britain’s economy.\n\n“It’s hard to see how that doesn’t end in Northern Ireland leaving the UK.”\n\nMrs Morgan told PoliticsHome that Mr Johnson’s timing was deliberate, saying: “He knows how important the party conference is to the Prime Minister, to the party, and it’s obviously designed to make it clear that, yet again, we will be talking as much about Boris as we will about the Conservative programme for government next week.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab \n\n\n\n\nIn a separate development, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab accused Brussels of using the Northern Ireland dispute as a way of penalising the UK for leaving the EU.\n\nHe told The Sun: “There are some out there in the  Commission who see it as a lever beyond the substantive issue.\n\n“There is no doubt there is a substantive issue about how we avoid a  to the hard border, but it has been magnied by those seeking to rely on it for political ends.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"airline norwegian ends belfast to new york and boston flights","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong.

Requiem Mass will take place at St Mary\u0027s in Drumragh on Sunday.\n\nIn a tribute posted on the Glenavon FC website, Mr Hamilton said: \"It\u0027s a tough time for the family, a tough time for everybody. \n\n\"Since Faye and I got together he\u0027s been to a lot of Glenavon games and became something of a lucky charm as we never lost a game while he was watching. \n\n\"I used to joke that I would send a car to bring him to the matches and bring him back home again. In all the games he saw us, we only drew one game and won the rest.\n\n\"It ended up that Glenavon meant a lot to him and he loved coming to the games. He was at the Irish Cup semi-finals and the finals and he became \u0027one of us\u0027 and he was one hell of a man who loved his sport, loved his family, loved his singing in the choir.\n\n\"The one good thing that has come out of it all in a really positive way is the family has just been told that he has saved two other people\u0027s lives by organ donations.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mobile phone data reveals number of irish border crossings each year","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This equates to less than 1 crossing per person each month or 0.1  trips per week.\n\nThe report shows 40% of the border crossings by NI residents went through the border at Londonderry.  \n\nThis was 34,600 crossings each weekday. Almost 20% of crossings by Northern Ireland residents went through Newry and Mourne , but only 14% of those crossings started there, with residents from other local government districts using that crossing zone as a route to the Republic.\n\nThe report shows that the majority of border crossings start and end in locations in close proximity to the border. \n\nBetween 80% and 88% of border crossings to the Republic by NI residents started in the border areas, while between 75% and 86% of all crossings by Irish residents to Northern Ireland end in border areas.\n\nSome 38% of border crossings by Northern Ireland residents on the average weekday and 26% on the average weekend day are estimated to be work-related. \n\nTherefore 62% of crossing during the week and 74% at the weekend are for social and leisure purposes. \n\nThis means that 65% of crossings over a full week are for social and leisure purposes.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Alex McLeish is building an exciting young Scottish side.\n\n“Wales are going from strength-to-strength under my old mate Giggsy .\n\n“And who can forget Gareth Southgate and England’s unbelievable performance this summer in Russia?\n\n“I made my Premier League debut in 1996, the last time there was a major football tournament on these shores, and the excitement across the country was something else.  So I really welcome the support the Government is offering.”\n\nLondon and Glasgow will host eleven games in the UEFA European Championships in 2020 with Wembley hosting the semi-finals and the final.\n\nIn the last six years the UK has successfully hosted the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the 2014 Tour De France Grand Depart and the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nAny England bid would face opposition from the joint campaign of Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay which could be buoyed by the fact 2030 marks 100 years since the first World Cup, held in Uruguay in 1930.\n\nIt is also possible there will be an African bid, especially in light of Morocco’s defeat to the USA for the 2026 tournament.\n\nLabour also welcomed the announcement, with shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary Tom Watson pointing out it had also backed the plan in July.\n\nThe deputy party leader added: “I’m delighted that the Prime Minister has followed Labour’s lead and is willing to back a bid.\n\n“This summer’s World Cup and the performance of England inspired the nation.\n\n“In 2030, it’s time for football to come home.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"top dup civil servant admits to hierarchy of political advisers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There was a glamour to being junior minister.\n\n“I feel a little uncomfortable. I feel torn in the sense of having to say this in public.\n\n“A lot of people thought he was over-promoted.”\n\nHe told the inquiry he advised former First Minister Peter Robinson not to appoint Mr Bell as Enterprise Minister.\n\nHe added Mr Bell was “very loyal” to Mr Robinson and he was rewarded for this.\n\n“Mr Robinson is his own man and makes his own decisions,” Mr Johnston added.\n\nMr Johnston also said he does not believe “we would be where we are today”  Mr Bell had not been given the job at DETI.\n\nMr Johnston also revealed it took ten days for Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness to agree the joint letter about Brexit that was then sent to the UK prime minister in 2016.\n\nHe was referring to how parts of the Northern Ireland political system worked adding that he could say “a lot of things that could deflate people”.\n\n“We didn’t want the public to see the elements of the sausage machine because it wasn’t always pretty,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait wait he screamed ryanair passenger tackled to ground making late dash across tarmac at dublin airport","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Fantastic.”\n\nThe app, created by an Australian firm called Crown Comms, was updated and the login  removed after concerns were raised with the party.\n\nJon Trickett, shadow cabinet office minister, said: “How can we trust this Tory Government with our country’s security when they can’t even build a conference app that keeps the data of their members, MPs and others attending safe and secure?\n\n“The Conservative Party should roll out some basic computer security training to get their house in order.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It’s absolute chaos, and it’s sure to be a big winner among gamers.\n\nBut how did the pros get on? Thankfully, a bunch of them have already given it a whirl.\n\nTottenham\n\n\nHarry Kane, Fernando Llorente, Moussa Dembele and Davinson Sanchez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo v two might be the perfect way to play this version of the game, and despite Fernando Llorente having to ask Harry Kane which buttons did what just after kick-off, he and the England striker were able to dominate.\n\nMousa Dembele claimed he couldn’t get used to the anarchic rules in a game which was dominated by attempted fouls and plenty of “successful” offsides, and it showed in the final score.\n\nA resounding 4-0 win in the end for Kane and Llorente was the result. Let’s hope they remember to play by the rules when they get back to Premier League business.\n\nEverton\n\n\nTom Davies, Kieran Dowell, Jonjoe Kenny and Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot more leg on show here, and why not? Tom Davies and Dominic Calvert-Lewin paired up to play Kieran Dowell and Jonjoe Kenny, and the game did not disappoint.\n\nDCL appeared to be the first to master the conditions, telling Davies: “I’m off Dav, just ping it in behind” before scoring from an offside position.\n\nOther highlights include one of the greatest runs of all time from Jordan Pickford, as well as a cracking effort from Idrissa Gueye before the game ended 2-1 to DCL and Davies.\n\nManchester City\n\n\nKevin De Bruyne and ChrisMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, it’s Kevin De Bruyne playing Fa 19 in a suit against YouTuber ChrisMD.\n\nDe Bruyne’s initial thoughts were that “It’s very weird” to play without rules, but he soon got the hang of it, winning 2-1 with a last-minute header from Edinson Cavani.\n\nDe Bruyne also opined that “No Rules” Fa should do away with throw-ins also, so look out for that in Fa 20.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch wouldbe burglar gets shock of his life when he realises hes on camera","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They’re going to do whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do. They’ll be doing things that we have never even thought of,” he said. “And hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine.”\n\n\nThe nomination of Judge Brett M.

Mr Judge has also denied Ms Ford’s allegations.\n\nLawyers for PJ Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser, two others who Ms Ford said were in the house when she was attacked, have said their clients are willing to cooperate “fully” with the FBI’s investigation.\n\nA third woman, Julie Swetnick, accused Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Judge of excessive drinking and inappropriate treatment of women in the early 1980s, among other accusations. \n\nMr Kavanaugh has called her accusations a “joke” and Mr Judge has said he “categorically” denies the allegations.\n\nMs Swetnick’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said on Saturday afternoon that his client had not been contacted by the FBI but is willing to fully cooperate with investigators.\n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee from Rhode Island, said he expects the FBI would provide adequate staffing for the investigation, with teams working in parallel to investigate separate allegations. \n\nAgents should get support from the Judiciary Committee for rapid immunity and subpoena decisions, he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lion statue standing guard at venices san marco vandalised","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

ambulance to arrive.\n\nThe incident happened at the Brunswick Moviebowl in the Pennyburn Industrial Estate on Saturday, September 21.\n\nEamonn McLaughlin, Manager of the cinema at Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn, said that an ambulance took a full two hours after a female customer became ill and collapsed before 4pm. \n\nIt was almost 6pm before an ambulance arrived.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, said that when they contacted the emergency services, the operator said they were ‘inundated’.\n\nIt was brought to our attention that a customer was feeling unwell.\n\n“We always have quite a few first aiders on site so the lady was assessed and we decided we needed to ring for an ambulance while the customer was left in a comfortable position with a blanket and pillow.\n“The ambulance was first called at 3.45pm and didn’t arrive until 5.45pm. \n\n“We rang again at about 4.20pm and we were told that they were inundated with calls and they couldn’t tell us how much longer it would take, but that  there were any further concerns to ring back.\n\n“At about 5pm we were quite concerned because she was getting very weak and we wanted to know  we should try to have her gently lted into a car to get her to hospital.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that after contacting the operator again, they were told that the ambulance was coming from Strabane.\n\n“We wanted to know what the best thing to do was so we rang again at about 5pm and were told that an ambulance was on its way but that it was making its way from Strabane so was still quite a way off,” he added.\n\n“I had discussed it with the telephone operator and with the family and we decided to make the customer comfortable as we didn’t want to move her.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that he understood that the serious delay was down to the fact the ambulance service was ‘inundated’ with calls and didn’t have the resources to cope.\n\nHowever, he said he was happy that the woman was recovering well and that it had not been more serious.\n“Thankfully, she is doing well,” he said.\n\n“But  it had been more serious, it could have been a very dferent story.”\n\n\nDeteriorating position \n\n\nA spokesperson Northern Ireland Ambulance Service  confirmed that they received a call at 3.46pm last Saturday and, based on the information given, ‘the call was determined to be Category C, neither serious, nor immediately le-threatening’.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the call was referred to the Clinical Support Desk  Paramedic based in the Emergency Control Room, which ed a call at around 4.15pm to establish further details and advice was given  the patient’s condition deteriorated to call 999 again.\n\n“An ambulance had already been despatched by 5.04pm when a further 999 call was made at 5.16pm relating the deterioration of the patient’s condition and the call was upgraded to Category A, potentially serious or le-threatening,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“The ambulance then arrived at the scene at 5.44pm and the patient was assessed, treated and discharged at the scene.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot =

in demand\n\n\nThe NIAS spokesperson apologised for the wait and said that, in the last five years, there has been an increase in demand for ambulances with calls going up by almost 50 per cent.\n\n“NIAS would like to apologise for any discomfort and distress caused to the patient during her wait for the arrival of an ambulance,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“There has been an increase in ambulance response times over recent years and the main reason for this is the year on year increase in demand for our service.”\n\n“The number of calls to the Ambulance Service has increased from 150,093 in 2012/13, to 220,090 in 2017/18, an increase of 46 per cent.”\n\nThe NIAS spokesperson said that there has been a system in place to respond to the most serious cases first and urged the public to engage in a public consultation on the new model, was launched on Thursday.\n\n“In order to address this deteriorating position, NIAS has undertaken a detailed demand and capacity analysis which has established the level of additional capacity required to meet demand within the target timescales, and is developing proposals for a new clinical response model to provide the most urgent response to the most clinically urgent patients,” she said.\n\n“This proposed new model is based on similar models introduced elsewhere in the UK which have proved effective and indicate improved patient outcomes. \n\n“A public consultation on this proposed new model will be launched today and will be available on our website \nwww.nias.hscni.net\n. \n\n“NIAS would encourage all stakeholders to engage during the consultation process.”\n\n\nHeroes\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Foyle MLA and SDLP Health spokesperson Mark H Durkan, said that he had spoken to the Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service with regard to shortages in the emergency service.\n\n“I recently met with the newly appointed Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, Nicole Lappin, to highlight my concerns about the shortage and lack of cover in the North West area, which she accepted the merit of,” he said.\n\n“She outlined her desire to transform the service and make it fit for purpose. \n\n“The problems aren’t to do with the state of the fleet it is actually the shortage of human resources available.” \n\nHe added: “There are just not enough people in the job and I do not think the people doing the job have adequate support.\n\n“In fact, it is usually people who work on ambulances who share their concerns with me about the state of affairs that prevents them from doing their job and getting to people on time.\n\n“This is no reflection on the staff, they are absolute heroes but at times they are covering distances from Limavady to Omagh, leaving only one ambulance in this area.”\n\n\nPictured above: Brunswick Moviebowl where a woman who collapsed last Saturday had to wait two hours for an ambulance to arrive. \n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"beef jerky treats for wales

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has labelled the behaviour of Lord Melchett as \u0026ldquodisgraceful and called for immediate action.\n\nThe furore centres around a five year-old girl whose father wants her to attend a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan. However, because she lives in the country outside Castlewellan she would need to have school minibus transport provided for her.\n\nAccording to Mrs Smyth, she has been told by the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the child will have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe child\u0026rsquos father wants her to go to a controlled school and he is entitled to have her do so, Mrs Smyth said. \u0026ldquoI am thoroughly disgusted and I think that the Department of Education must be totally inefficient  they don\u0026rsquot answer within a month.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash There just seems to be no stopping the Downpatrick supergroup Rosetta Stone, who recently completed another dynamic tour of Japan and will be setting off on a trip to Thailand later this year.\n\nThe five members of the group \u0026mdash Damien, Terry and Colin McKee, Andy LeGear and Ian Mitchell \u0026mdash are just back from their second conquering trip to Japan where their latest hit, Sheila, is currently number one.\n\nIn the last year the band have been playing constantly across the globe and have built up a huge following in many countries, including Germany and Canada. But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working. When he arrived back at the vehicle an ignition key and a boot key had ben taken.\n\nPolice in Strangford have since been informed that a children\u0026rsquos sponsored walk was passing through the area at the time and they have appealed to parents to ask the children who took part  they know anything about the theft.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash A burning interest in art has led Newcastle couple Margaret and Gerry Grant into an unusual project \u0026mdash the opening of a new art gallery in their own home.\n\nWith over 200 paintings and sculptures of their own they have opened the gallery in an extension to their Bryansford Road house.\n\nBut it isn\u0026rsquot only for the fun of it. The Grants will be buying and selling works and promoting exhibitions. Already they have lined up an autumn show with exhibits from a Spanish painter and an Italian sculptor.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are aiming at the professional rather than the amateur, Mrs Grant said. \u0026ldquoOur main aim is to share our interest in art, but we do see the commercial and promotional sides to it.\n\n\u0026ldquoReally there is a wide range of work on show. My husband and I have been interested in art for a long time.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash A phantom clothes line thief has struck again \u0026mdash this time in Dundrum. The thief, who has been confining his acts to the Newcastle and Dundrum area, struck during the night at a house on the Dromara Road.\n\nA considerable number of children\u0026rsquos clothes were taken from the line, making it a profitable night for the thief.\n\nPolice in Dundrum and Newcastle are anxious to catch the thief, who must have a considerable wardrobe stocked up by now. Anyone with information or who sees anyone acting suspiciously around houses at night should contact them immediately.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash Plans for a new primary school in Killinchy have brought a \u0026rsquono go\u0026rsquo sign from local residents. In a petition to the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the residents of Ardview Park have expressed serious concern about the plans.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos not the building of the school they object to, but rather the fact that access to the site will be off Ardview Park. They say they are concerned about traffic which will be using the road, both during the construction of the school and when it is opened.\n\nTheir petition was recently shown to members of the Board\u0026rsquos Finance Committee. Afterwards it was agreed to set up a special sub-committee to visit the school and report back on the plans.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash A Ballygowan housewe will be one of eight ladies who will be taking part in the national finals of the Cook of the Realm contest.

The top prize is valued at more than \u0026pound4,000.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Ardglass boxer Ray Ross has been offered a wonderful chance to make an impact on the British lightweight scene.\n\nEvery since he lost a close decision to Charlie Nash for the Irish title two years ago, the 28 year-old slugger has shown indferent form. But now the Ardglass golf course greenskeeper has a chance to make the top before he runs out of fight time and interest.\n\nRoss has been matched with the experienced Jonnie Elliott, of Bournemouth, over eight rounds at Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast on October 11 and a win would hoist Ross up the lightweight ladder and on to bigger punch for paydays.\n\nRay is part of a big British title fight night involving Antrim southpaw Jim Montague against Clinton McKenzie for the vacant light welterweight title.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Kilclief in full flow as ‘Fin are bottled up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA RESILIENT Kilclief outfit produced a rousing second half display to shatter Aughlisnafin\u0026rsquos championship dreams at St Colman\u0026rsquos Park, Drumaness, on Saturday.\n\nDespite going into the break only 0-6 to 0-4 down, Kilclief were staring down the barrel of an ignoble defeat after losing the influential Louis McMullan and James McGrath to early black cards.\n\nTo make matters even worse, they also lost the talismanic Ciaran Sloan to a hamstring injury and almost down to the bare bones, they looked vulnerable and there for the taking.\n\nHowever, led brilliantly by Aiden McCann and Eoin King they took the game to Aughlisnafin with a swagger and sparkle that Willie Megoran\u0026rsquos side were unable to contain.\n\nAughlisnafin were impressively out of the traps first.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.\n\nA Force 8 gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some 90 minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasn\u0026rsquot.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at 6pm, ing home one hour later.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\n\nSome of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekend\u0026rsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellan\u0026rsquos Lower Square for generations.\n\nSlieve Croob councillor Ro\u0026iacutes\u0026iacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the town\u0026rsquos permanent Christmas tree.\n\n\u0026ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8745087.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

during an extraordinary naval escapade is to go on public display for the first time after his son hunted across the world to reclaim it.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n

Incident, during which UK forces came under attack by Chinese communists in the midst of that country’s intense civil war – an encounter which threatened to erupt into a full-scale battle between the two powers. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe international incident saw the vessel HMS Amethyst fired upon and virtually sunk, and then held captive, before going on to launch a brazen escape.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nSamuel Bannister was among those to live through it, and was decorated for his service.\n\nNow his son Andy says this medal is to go on display in HMS

Andy had that medal and two others valued on an edition of the Antiques Roadshow, broadcast on September 23. \n\nHere he reveals in detail his family’s role in the 1949 escapade, and the quest to find the medal.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nFROM ‘ACTOR’ TO WAR HERO:\n\nWhen he was a child growing up in east Belfast, Andy never knew his father Samuel to talk about what he went through in China.\n\nHe recalls how, aged about eight years old, the war movie ‘Yangtze Incident’ came on the TV.\n\n“People would say: Your dad’s film is on”, said Andy, who is now 51 and living in Lisburn.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I assumed my dad had been an actor.\n\n“It wasn’t until later in le I realised he had been involved in this, and it was part of his le.”\n\nSamuel – whose own father fought in WWI and WII, dying at Dunkirk – had been a stoker in the engine room of the HMS Amethyst.\n\nAs it was sailing along the River Yangtze on April 20, 1949, on its way to guard a British embassy building, it was hit by Communist artillery fire.\n\nIt took heavy casualties – many of them fatal – and Samuel was struck in the chest with shrapnel while working below deck.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen the call came to evacuate the ship, Samuel made it overboard and then ashore along with an English sailor friend, Keith ‘Boy’ Martin.\n\nSamuel was taken to a primitive village hospital alongside his friend, and was operated on without anaesthetic. He was then 21.\n\n“In the film it actually shows the actor who plays him [Ian Bannen] biting on a rag,” said Andy.\n\n“It’s actually quite a big part of the film, because my dad and ‘Boy’ Martin became political pawns for the Chinese.\n\n“They tried to get them to sign statements saying the Royal Navy had opened fire first – but they wouldn’t do it.\n\n“He’s a young fella, coming from Belfast. The next thing you’re being held captive by Chinese communists. It must’ve been very traumatic.”\n\nThe pair were eventually ed to the ship – only to find it had been essentially impounded with the surviving crew still onboard.\n\nAbout three months after the initial incident, Amethyst – by then able to float once again - tried to escape its captivity.\n\nUnder cover of darkness it set out down the Yangtse – but was spotted, and had to run a gauntlet of shells as artillery guns on the banks opened fire.\n\nAfter over 100 miles the ship made it to the open sea and freedom - with King George himself offering “hearty congratulations on their daring exploit”.\n\n\nHARD TIMES LED TO MEDAL SALE:\n\nSamuel later went on to fight in the Korean War too.\n\nUpon ing to civilian le in Northern Ireland he worked at engine-maker Rolls Royce in Dundonald. He died in 1996 aged 69 of bowel cancer.\n\nSamuel had been awarded medals both for the Yangtse Incident and Korean campaign, but at some point in his le had been forced to sell them to raise funds to look after his we and four children.\n\nAndy said “it had always been my boyhood dream to try and get these medals back”.\n\nHowever, the person who had bought them was not known.\n\n“Everybody I asked about it, dferent collectors, said: You’ve no chance of getting them,” said Andy.\n\n“But when the internet first arrived, it became a lot easier to search.\n\n“And after years of searching the net I finally came across Dixons, an auctioneer in London, which had sold the medals.”\n\nIt turns out they had changed hands a number of times.\n\n“I was able to make about 100 phonecalls - a guy, who knew a guy, who knew a collector - and I got word they had tracked them to a collector in Asia.”\n\nThere were three medals in all - the Yangtze medal, plus a UK Korean War medal and a UN Korean War medal.\n\nThe collector - knowing a family member was seeking them – demanded £10,000.\n\nAndy paid up, plus another £500 for the intermediary who found them.\n\nWhen he appeared on the Antiques Roadshow on Sunday, their estimated value was put at £6,000 to £9,000.\n\nAndy said he had been “held to ransom” over the price, but has no regrets.\n\n“HMS Caroline are going to have a Yangtze Incident display next year. They will display the medals at that,” he said.\n\n“I’m delighted. That’s the reason I contacted the Antiques Roadshow – just to keep the story alive.”\n\nTHREE GENERATIONS CONNECTED:\n\nDuring the course of Andy’s research, he uncovered another Ulsterman who shared the ship with his father.\n\nHe came across a man called Raymond McCullough whose believed his own Belfast father  was on the Amethyst too.\n\nThey met on an online forum, and swapped stories.\n\nAndy was able to find pictures of the Raymond Senior and Samuel together, confirming they had indeed both served on the ship.\n\nBut what was even more surprising was a picture Andy came across in a scrap book it showed two women standing together at the docks, waiting for their sons to come off the Amethyst.\n\nIt turned out the ladies were Andy and Raymond’s grandmothers.\n\n“When I rang Raymond and told him, he had goosebumps all over his arms,” said Andy.\n\n“Our grandmothers had met, then our fathers – and now us.”\n\nRaymond Senior has since died, but his medals too have recently come to light.\n\nThese are likewise now set to go on display in HMS Caroline.\n\nAndy believes that there were as many as seven men from dferent parts of the island of Ireland on the Amethyst at the time of the incident.\n\nIdeally, what he would really like is “a permanent memorial to Amethyst – to all the guys who came from here who were involved in the Yangtze Incident. I think that’d be fantastic.”\n\nHe asked anyone whose relative was on the ship , to get in touch with him at sammysmedals@gmail\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n

for 15 years has admitted that his party broke the law in appointing party members to lucrative special adviser posts.\n\n                \nIn a bluntly vivid picture of Stormont which was a long way from the glossy spin which the DUP and Sinn Féin put on their administration at the time, Timothy Johnston, who is now the DUP’s chief executive, set that unlawful activity in the context of a culture whereby he said both parties routinely broke the rules in Stormont.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDuring a strikingly assured appearance before the RHI Inquiry – the first time the DUP’s key backroom figure has been interviewed in public – he also alleged that Sinn Féin broke at least the spirit of the law which barred them from appointing members with serious criminal convictions as Spads.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Johnston, who before becoming a Spad was the DUP’s chief spin doctor, also did a signicant U-turn in his evidence.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn written evidence to the inquiry, Mr Johnston had said “I had no sense that there was an understood or recognised hierarchy of advisers”.\n\nHowever, after evidence from multiple witnesses – including DUP colleagues – that there was a de facto hierarchy with Mr Johnston either in a very senior position or “at the top of the tree”, he accepted that he was more powerful than many of his colleagues.\n\nHowever, the 40-year-old insisted that he was not as powerful as his portrayal in the media would suggest.\n\nMr Johnston’s evidence brought to an end a bruising week for the DUP at the RHI Inquiry where many of its senior figures have revealed far more about how the party really operates than they would have wanted the public to know.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDocumentation which the inquiry ordered senior DUP figures to hand over reveals internal feuding, suspicion and distrust.\n\nMr Johnston will  to give further evidence later in October and the inquiry will hear from at least one other senior DUP figure, Simon Hamilton.\n\nThe inquiry has heard evidence that many times when DUP ministers appointed Spads they signed false letters in which they claimed that they had examined a “pool of candidates” and chosen their Spad because they were “by far the best”.\n\nIn fact, they rarely appear to have looked at more than one candidate and on many occasions were simply allocated their Spad by the party leadership.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThat is in breach of the Civil Service  Act  2013, which stipulates that all Spad appointments “shall be subject to the terms of the code”, a document which set out a series of processes which must involve the minister.\n\nHowever, despite admissions from senior DUP figures – including leader Arlene Foster – that the party’s actions were contrary that law, there is unlikely to be any sanction as there are now no Spads in post whose appointments can be legally challenged.\n\nMr Johnston yesterday faced detailed questioning about the issue.\n\nHe said he believed that the false letters signed by DUP ministers had likely been a “tick-box exercise”.\n\nHe said he never recalled seeing such a letter for other Spads. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said: “I presume you have seen one or two now?”\n\nMr Johnston said: “Well I’m aware from what has been read at the inquiry...” \n\nSir Patrick said: “Mr Johnston, you are and have been a Spad to the first minister for a number of years...I’m assuming from that that you understand the importance of the matters into which this inquiry is enquiring.\n\n“Now, I ask you again. I assume that you will have seen copies of these letters now?”\n\nMr Johnston said that he had not.\n\nSir Patrick later asked him: “Why was it necessary to ignore the act and the code? Was it because there was a great drive to centralise power in this party?”\n\nMr Johnston said: “I think, chairman, there certainly was an element of centralisation, yes.”\n\nThen, in an apparent allusion to Sinn Féin and other parties, he said: “I think there was a sense of trying to mirror what was a very centralised operation for a number of the parties.”\n\nHe said the work Spads were required to do was “so dficult” that it meant there was a need for the inidual to be drawn from the party and within the party there was a very limited pool of suitable people.\n\nSir Patrick said there was no real argument about the idea that Spads are a necessary and very useful part of democratic government but he queried “how does it come about that an ordinary person in the street - the person in Northern Ireland - whose governed by this arrangement, looking to see how a Spad is chosen, finds an act in 2013 which provides a clear and detailed mandatory code as to how Spads are chosen.\n\n“That person, faced with the reality of your party - and it may well be other parties - would have no understanding of why you didn’t comply with the code, of why you didn’t amend the act.\n\n“You’ve got two processes here – you’ve got an official, democratically-elected Assembly that passes an act and a mandatory code. But in reality you have a very centralised power structure which allocates Spads to ministers, which involves the first minister, which involves – as you’ve told us now – advice or guidance or information from the first minister’s Spads.\n\n“Neither the first minister nor any other Spad is referred to in the code or has a role in the code. So you have two utterly orced structures – one of which is adhered to, the other of which is the official one that anybody will see  they look it up...that is not adhered to. That cannot be a satisfactory situation from a democratic point of view.”\n\nMr Johnston said: “I accept from a transparency point of view, from a democratic point of view...”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Not just transparency, but you have a provision that sets out what you should be doing to democratically reflect the will of the Northern Ireland people - and you’re not doing that quite the reverse.”\n\nMr Johnston said: “No, I accept that, I think, as time went on, things become very comfortable in the sense of how our party and other parties appointed these positions...”\n\nSir Patrick interjected: “I’m not saying other parties – that may well be – but we’re concerned, as you know, with a particular sequence of events.”\n\nMr Johnston said he did not think very much time was spent after an election in studying how Spads would be appointed – and said that that included by the Civil Service, who had a role in ensuring the rules were followed.\n\nHe added: “I just simply make the point that by 2016 the political reality of what was happening was as I have described to you, counsel, and I have to take it as exactly as you say...[we] didn’t get focused on the mandatory nature of the code, and I think where we ended up was a process that probably worked for the output of the system but didn’t comply with the letter and the spirit of what had been passed [into law].”\n\nMr Johnston said it was his view that “we would be better...either sticking to what the law is,  the law works – and  the law doesn’t work, then you look at something else and be honest about it and say ‘[Stormont] could learn some lessons from other legislatures...up to a point, because ultimately in the nature of the mandatory coalition and in the nature of the parties that make up that mandatory coalition and maybe where they’ve come from and where they’re at now even in terms of their development I think it may not always be possible to be as pure as what is done in other places.”\n\nSir Patrick said that the “real problem here” is that “you’re ignoring what the Assembly has passed you’re building a very powerful centralised structure – and it is not in the least surprising, I think you’ll understand, that Spads involved in that structure will look to the central power holders, rather than to the minister, which is completely contrary to the code.”\n\nMr Johnston said: “I accept that”, and went on to say that “there were many things passed by the Assembly which didn’t always sit easy with the wider Executive and maybe sometimes were even ignored”.\n            \n    \n    try

the RHI Inquiry that there had been no understood hierarchy of DUP Spads.\n\n                \nMr Johnston had said in his first witness statement over a year ago: “I had no sense that there was an understood or recognised hierarchy of advisers”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThat evidence was challenged by many witnesses to the inquiry.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen asked yesterday  he acknowledged that a hierarchy of the type described by ious witnesses existed, Mr Johnston said: “Yes. If I can put a bit of context to it, I think there’s a distinction between the legal here and the political.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I think in the legal sense from 2007 right through the period we were all appointed we were all seen as Spads to a particular minister - there wasn’t any particular ranking in terms of a formal structure where, you know, Mr Johnston and Mr [Richard] Bullick were seen as the captains and another seen as inferior. But I absolutely acknowledge that on the political side of things, I suppose, I am at broad common cause with all that has been said [by other witnesses] - maybe slightly dferent emphasis on some of it.”\n\nCounsel for the inquiry Donal Lunny did not press Mr Johnston on the reason for the change in his evidence. \n\nMr Johnston said that because he and Mr Bullick had been there since 2007 “by virtue of having been a special adviser to the first minister...I absolutely do recognise the fact that I have probably been perceived – I think it has been a little overstated,  you don’t mind me saying, in some of the media commentary about the importance of my inidual role in the sense that I served three first ministers at their pleasure”.\n\nMr Johnston said that at ious points he had expected to leave to do “other things” and that he “did not insert myself as a long-standing adviser” but was there because others had confidence in him.\n\n                            \n

circumvented a high profile law which meant that those with serious criminal convictions could not act as Stormont special advisers \u0026#8211 and top civil servants knew of the situation, Timothy Johnston has said.\n\n                \nIn evidence to the public inquiry into the RHI scandal, the DUP chief executive spoke in illuminating detail about his decade at the heart of power in Stormont Castle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFreely admitting that neither the DUP nor Sinn Féin wanted transparency around how they operated, Mr Johnston said: “We didn’t always want the public to see the elements of the sausage machine because it wasn’t always pretty.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInquiry chairman Sir Patrick said drily: “It’s not.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMr Johnston outlined how Sinn Féin “effectively had people acting as special advisers but not in the proper  of a special adviser role”.\n\nThat happened after the passage of Jim Allister’s Spad bill into law.\n\nMr Allister’s legislation – tabled in response to public anger at the appointment of Mary McArdle, convicted of the murder of Mary Travers as she left Mass with her family – barred those with serious criminal convictions from operating as Spads.\n\nHowever, the inquiry has uncovered documentary evidence that Sinn Féin appears to have side-stepped that by putting some of those with criminal convictions in a role which oversaw the special advisers.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nYesterday Mr Johnston expanded on the material which the inquiry had compelled Sinn Féin, the civil service and others to release.\n\nHe said that the situation was “known to senior civil servants”.\n\nSir Patrick asked why no one had raised the fact that Sinn Féin’s Spads were “being supervised by someone who can’t be a Spad because of the provisions of the act”.\n\nMr Johnston said: “I certainly recall raising it with the head of the civil service and I know others did.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, in a glimpse of Mr Johnston as an arch-pragmatist within the DUP, he said that “realpolitik” meant that “you weigh up in your mind ‘am I going to get a productive outcome by this type of approach, and by dealing with the people where the power lay, or am I better making a theological point about it’, and the likelihood was that it wasn’t going to change...most of what we did for many, many years was just pure, raw negotiation between two parties who were in the government but the line between what was a party negotiation and what was a government negotiation - I’m not sure that it was ever anything than blurred.”\n\nHe said that Executive business was resolved between the DUP and Sinn Féin “often to the exclusion of other parties who were also in the Executive”.\n\nMr Johnston said he could appreciate how  the man in the street was to come to Stormont “they’d probably head back out the door very quickly in great despair, as many of us who were in the system did many times”.\n\nHe said that he “was not saying that the end justied the means” but that often the process led to good outcomes for the public “and you weighed that with a greater weight in the balance than maybe the ugliness of how you got there”.\n\nSir Patrick said the inquiry understood the context of a mandatory coalition, but that there was a need to look at how it could be that politicians and civil servants exchanged letters which they knew not to be true.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try
