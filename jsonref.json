They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor. Bill Evans and his wife got up at 4am to watch the ceremony of a woman he now knows as a relatives\u0027My grandfather\u0027s nickname was Happy because he was a joyful person and wherever he traveled he made people happy. He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link.

The landings began the Allied invasion of Europe that beat the Germans and ended Adolf Hitler\u0027s regime. Pictured are 48th Royal Marines at Juno Beach where thousands of British and Canadian troops landed, only suffering 340 dead and 574 wounded before they began a push south the next day, beating off a determined German counter attack and joining up with Gold Beach to form a continuous front          A massive armada of ships drop off troops, tanks, vehicles, and equipment on Utah beach, one of five beaches invaded by the Allies. Landing parties took it on June 6, 1944, with just 197 casualties as resistance was light. This photo was taken after the beach was taken and shows reinforcements arriving. The bulk of the fighting for those involved took place in the weeks later as they pushed deeper into France. The original black and white photographs were painstakingly colourised, each snap taking between four and five hours to bring to colour          On the other side of the channel, soldiers load artillery equipment, vehicles, and troops aboard landing ships fitted to carry tanks in Brixham, England, on June 1, 1944, in preparation for the invasion. They later sailed over to Normandy with the fleet dodging Germany aircraft and dropped everything off on the beaches for the massive invasion          American soldiers calmly walk on to a beach in Normandy, either because it was already taken or it was one of the areas where the secret invasion caught the Germany unawares and there was no resistance. Codenamed Operation Neptune, the landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history          A landing craft form the USS Samuel Chase lands troops of US Army First Division on Omaha, the most famous and easily the bloodiest landing of the Normandy invasion where up to 4,700 of the 43,000 Allied troops were cut down by the defending Germans as they rushed ashore with heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous          U.S. troops are towed into Utah beach, with a squad of medical trucks in the background making their approach. The troops don\u0027t appear concerned, indicating the beach was already captured by this time. Allied infantry and armoured isions began landing on the coast of France at 6.30am. The target 50-mile stretch of the Normandy coast was ided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword          Glider crews on landing craft head back after landing ahead of the invasion force, ready to be sent in again farther behind enemy lines to attack positions from behind along with airborne parachute troops          The U.S. Coast Guard manned USS LST-21 unloads British Army tanks and trucks onto a Rhino barge during the early hours of the invasion on Gold Beach, a relatively easy landing where only 30 were killed          British Airborne Pathfinders at Harwell check their watches on night of June 5, hours before they would be dropped behind enemy lines before and during the time when their infantry comrades would storm the beaches miles north of them. They wanted to be sure they all had the same time to coordinate jumps. The airborne assault involved 24,000 American, British and Canadian troops jumping shortly after midnight          Men of the British 22nd Independent Parachute Company in the 6th Airborne Division being briefed for the invasion on June 4 or 5. The invasion was originally scheduled for June 5 but postponed for a day by bad weather. These men landed behind enemy lines under cover of darkness and needed briefings to know their role as they would be separated          British troops land on Sword Beach, the easternmost of the beaches chosen for the invasion. It was a relatively easy landing with a few hundred casualties but the going got tougher after the beach as they were attacked from heavily-defended German position and a counter-attack by a tank ision on the way to Caen          British troops dig in after taking Sword beach and prepare to advance to the strategic city of Caen. One soldier appears to be operating a radio that uses a hand crank for power. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled, using specialised tanks          German  Tiger I tank form the Panzer VI ision camouflaged in the undergrowth in Villers-Bocage, a town well inland from the landings. These hidden positions proved decisive in ambushing advancing British troops seeking to take the town and forcing them to retreat after many vehicles were destroyed          U.S. Army 4th Infantry Division troops collapse exhausted after taking Utah beach before the even harder work of pushing south into France begins, with the port city of Cherbourg their objective. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha          Reinforcements not involved in the initial landings arrive to strengthen captured Allied positions and push farther into France, among a force of more than 1.4 million troops. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until June 12, however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months           Lesley George Robinson, 98, the last survivor of the RAF veterans who landed at Omaha Beach, lays a wreath as fellow Normandy veterans attend a wreath laying ceremony at the Tactical Air Force Memorial besides Omaha Beach at Vierville-sur-Mer in Normandy on June 4, 2018          The handful of veterans still alive who were involved in the invasion reunited to pay respects to fallen comrades 74 years on. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead          Mr Robinson speaks at the wreath laying ceremony alongside representatives from the U.S., France, Britain, Canada, and other nations involved in the landings          The old men were still able to make a few jokes at the somber occasion as they put down their canes and sat for the ceremony           Mr Robinson shakes hands with standard-bearers representing France.

The Oscar-winning actress was one of many famous faces the Prince encountered at the event including acting royalty Cary Grant and 1970s style icon Farrah Fawcett          One of the photos shows The Queen during a royal visit to then-Communist Yugoslavia in the 1972. It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit along with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour six years later when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the visit a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          Candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen.

Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses.

Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat.

He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link.

Through Colville, Elizabeth requested he photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies in 1951. The success of this photograph launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work          Another photo shows a bearded Prince Charles, aged in his 20s, on horseback looking strikingly similar to his son Prince Harry. The fascinating images were taken by Royal photographer John Scott who was given unprecedented access to the Royals from the 1950s to the 1980s          Prince Philip cooling off after a Polo match.

He attended a lunch held at the 20th Century Fox studio in Hollywood, California, where he met film royalty such as Cary Grant, Charlton Heston and Lauren Bacall, along with the cast of M*A*S*H - most of whom were still in costume. According to a Mash fan site, he watched an episode of the series being filmed along with an episode of Charlie\u0027s Angels          The Prince of Wales is also pictured in the archive meeting other actresses and actors in Hollywood during a trip in 1977, three years before he first started courting Diana. His visit made headlines across the country and saw hundreds of fans turn out to catch a glimpse of the Royal on US soil          Prince Charles (centre with his back turned) is pictured meeting Hollywood actress Sophia Loren (third right in black dress) at a Hollywood party in 1977. The Oscar-winning actress was one of many famous faces the Prince encountered at the event including acting royalty Cary Grant and 1970s style icon Farrah Fawcett          One of the photos shows The Queen during a royal visit to then-Communist Yugoslavia in the 1972. It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit along with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour six years later when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the visit a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          Candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen. In the UK and indeed many other parts of the world, the fascination with the British Royals is unwavering and here we have an archive that documents four decades of their lives\u0027          A smiling Queen at Balmoral in the early 1950\u0027s. Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses.

Share them with our picture editor carly.earl@theIn 1972, Alan Adler owned a grocery shop that wasn’t doing very well. An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland. It’s been our life for 50 years.” Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth?

Al Baker replied this was not the case at Qatar, before adding: “Of course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.” His comments met with loud groans of disapproval from many journalists in the room.Later, in an interview with Bloomberg TV, he said more than a third of Qatar Airways staff were female, including pilots and senior vice-presidents. He added there was no gender inequality at the Gulf carrier, which has a close business partnership with British Airways. Qatar is also the largest single shareholder in BA’s parent company, IAG.Asked whether he would welcome a female executive as chief executive, Al Baker, who has run Qatar Airways since 1997, said: “It will be my pleasure to have a female CEO candidate I could then develop to become CEO after me.”Qatar Airways has long had an abysmal reputation for its treatment of its predominantly female cabin crew, at one time firing them for being pregnant. The airline is believed to have eased some restrictions on the movement of its crew during non-working hours, which have included curfews, living in monitored accommodation and contractual bans on marriage without express company permission. Al Baker’s elevation to Iata chair comes seven years after he launched a ferocious attack on the organisation’s leadership at the annual meeting, and four years after he hosted a sumptuous AGM in Qatar, surprising airline executives with a guest appearance by Kylie Minogue after the evening meal.When the Iata board posed for a group photo last week, there was one woman among 26 airline chiefs – Christine Ourmières-Widener, the chief executive of UK regional carrier Flybe.Some rivals have taken action to promote more women to senior positions. Two-fifths of Qantas Airways’ senior management is female, including the heads of the international and frequent-flier loyalty businesses, according to the airline’s chief executive, Alan Joyce.Joyce said: “It’s the right business thing to do and it’s the right moral thing to do.”SkyTeam appointed Delta executive Kristin Colvile as chief executive of the airline alliance this week.Heathrow moved swiftly to distance itself from its board member’s comments.

Almost 6,000 shops closed in 2017 – the highest since the economy was emerging from the deep recession caused by the financial crisis of 2008-09 – and well-known brands including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Mothercare and House of Fraser are planning further closures this year.“Retail sales in May saw their highest growth since January 2014 as better weather and the bank holiday effect led shoppers to buy from garden furniture and summer fashion ranges recovering some of the ground lost in April,” Dickinson said. “Food sales also stood out, with the best single month’s performance since July 2013.”Dickinson said: “Despite this more positive set of sales results, the retail environment remains extremely challenging, with trend growth still very low by historical standards.”Paul Martin, KPMG’s UK head of retail, said: “Two bank holiday weekends, a royal wedding and of course sunnier spells will have been the main drivers behind the apparent rebound, with both online and high street sales thankfully up overall.”While the construction industry continued to stage a modest recovery in May after bad weather earlier in 2018, reduced demand from struggling retailers was one reason cited in the latest IHS MarkitCIPS purchasing managers survey for the fourth decline in new orders in five months.The reading on the IHS MarkitCIPS construction purchasing managers’ index remained steady at 52.5 points in May, against economists’ forecasts for a slight decline in activity from the previous month. Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, cautioned that a renewed drop in new work “hinted that the recovery could prove short-lived”.Spending on experiences such as music festivals and sporting events would remain strong over the coming months, the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a5f475e166f98a3338c9840ef4633a7538fe91/0_163_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016c6afd4f78d680166a3f358d8ed83a","title":"chris grayling railways transport","story":"We are sorry to announce that Chris Grayling has not been cancelled. This service will continue running for some time yet, regardless of disruption to your journey, although the government does apologise for any inconvenience caused.That was roughly the substance of the transport secretary’s statement to parliament on the mushrooming rail crisis, which if nothing else helped to explain the Whitehall mutterings that any minister following Grayling into a department can expect to spend a fair while sorting out the mess. The Ministry of Justice is still grappling with the legacy of his three years there, including legal aid cuts that have recently brought barristers out on strike. Anyone using the Northern or Govia Thameslink rail lines, meanwhile, will know just how well his current brief is going. The Commons heard this week of children in tears at stations because cancellations meant they couldn’t get to school (remember, this is exam season) and adults fearing for their jobs because they can’t physically get to work, or get back in time to collect the kids from nursery.Yet somehow Grayling lurches on, now towards an issue that has defeated wilier transport secretaries than him for over a decade: expanding Heathrow. Never forget that he is both a Brexiteer, one of those whose declining political stock perked up instantly after the EU referendum, and Theresa May’s old campaign manager when she ran for the leadership. The politics of Brexit suggest he’s unsackable at least until May has struggled through the EU withdrawal bill process (and associated threats to her tenure) even as the laws of electoral physics suggest he should go. And so he serves as a handy reminder of everything that’s hamstringing this government: too many people in high office for the wrong reasons, a perceived tin ear for northern England and a not unrelated fatal inability to deliver on the central promise of May’s premiership. She said she’d stand for the forgotten places and people, those overlooked by fancy London elites.Two years on and people in Burnley and Bolton and Blackpool can’t get to work, journeys from Hull across the Pennines are apparently taking longer than before the new “improved” timetable, and government gives the unfortunate impression of having launched itself into ineffectual action only when the furious commuters of Hertfordshire and Kent started emailing their Conservative MPs. Grayling’s resignation alone will not solve the wider problems that exposes.For most people, most of the time, politics forms at best an irritating background hum in life. But there’s nothing like hours of stewing on an overcrowded platform, panicking about what the boss will say if you’re late again, to remind people of its existence. That much was evident all the way down the line from south London to Brighton and the south coast back in 2016 where a long-running dispute between drivers and management on the Southern line exposed a hidden economic precariousness.People priced out of London property over the past decade had coped by moving further and further out into the shires, banking on still being able to reach the big city fairly easily for work. But during the stoppages they were stranded, and even those not directly affected began to realise just much they relied on often unreliable trains. Rail was an issue at the 2017 election in marginal seats such as Amber Rudd’s Hastings and Rye, and a similar feeling that government can’t even be trusted with the basics that make everyday life possible will now be growing in the commuter belt around Manchester and Liverpool too.This fiasco doesn’t, in theory, make a particularly strong case for renationalising the railways Network Rail is an arm’s length public sector body but it’s hardly emerged covered in glory, accused as it is for failing to deliver all necessary infrastructure upgrades before new timetables came in last month. But in practice the chaos is absolutely feeding Labour’s argument that the railways should be under direct political control, as voters hear Grayling wailing – much as he did during the Southern dispute – that there isn’t really much he personally can do to sort this out, and naturally enough wonder what’s the point of him then. Sweeping up after this particular mess, in short, will require one hell of a dustpan and brush."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78f81e58c60ff76c9ae330aa125255525a324cb/0_0_2268_1360/master/2268.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a51ad8e9f58760d0bf409c27373c24f","title":"simon cowell giving up his phone is the ultimate show of affluence","story":"Smartphones used to be a status symbol. Now they are a necessity for all but the most privileged peopleDigital detoxes are all the rage these days, but did you know that unplugging from your smartphone suddenly can have severe, occasionally nauseating, side-effects? Within minutes of deciding to disconnect from the modern world to live a purer, more analogue life, some people have reported overwhelming feelings of smug superiority. Many of them appear to transform into modern messiahs, eager to preach the virtues of a smartphone-free life to anyone who will listen.All of that is great for Cowell. But far from being an astonishing confession, I would call his statements astonishingly condescending. Most people don’t have the luxury of abstaining from their smartphones. Many people rely on them to be able to take part in the gig economy. Ever heard an Uber driver talk about giving up their phone? Or a Deliveroo rider? No, because without their phones they would not be able to do their jobs.Just a few years ago, smartphones were a status symbol today they are the status quo. In our always-on world, it is choosing not to use your phone that is the ultimate show of affluence you could call this sans phone lifestyle luxury luddism. After all, the easiest way to make a living in the modern economy without a smartphone is to pay an army of assistants with phones to do things for you. I am sure Cowell did not arrange his interview with the Mail on Sunday by carrier pigeon.As smartphones have become ingrained in our lives, tech executives have claimed more concern about the ways in which they have hooked people to their wares. On Monday, Apple unveiled tools to help combat tech addiction at its Worldwide Developers Conference. These include Screen Time, which will let iOS users set daily time limits for apps. But while apps like these may be well meaning, they do little to solve the bigger issue – that, to opt out of the on-demand economy the tech titans helped create, you need to be immensely privileged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8d5ce6acc157e29cfa438af9da789a83c9c3070/500_937_7323_4393/master/7323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a801e9d5c5a26cee150f9c1d689964f9","title":"grammar schools bbc documentary divisive","story":"BBC2’s new series surely puts a further dent in Theresa May’s plans to expand selective educationI suspect I am not the only person who felt beamed into some alien universe watching the first episode of Grammar Schools: Who Will Get In?, BBC2’s mini-series focusing on the transfer to secondary school in the selective borough of Bexley.Are there really parts of erse, metropolitan London in 2018 in which primary-age children are put through the 11-plus test? Who could not be haunted by the silent tears of Jaenita’s mother, who works at Poundland and has spent hundreds of pounds a month for years on test tuition, only to see her plucky, articulate daughter fear herself “a failure in life”?Parts two and three of the series will concentrate on the secondary school years, particularly the run-up to GCSEs, with Erith secondary modern struggling with a minority of disruptive students and severe teacher shortages in science, while Townley grammar has the pick of highly qualified staff.It’s riveting drama. But what most strikes me is the subtle way that broadcasters have changed their approach to this isive subject. A 2006 BBC documentary about Joe Prentis, a Birmingham boy going through the 11-plus nightmare, was much less critical about the process, happy to describe families “seeking refuge” in a grammar school at a time of “failing standards”.In 2012, I was part of a group that made a complaint to the BBC about its documentary Grammar Schools: A Secret History, a rosily nostalgic view of postwar selection that saluted the grammar schools of old. We didn’t succeed with our complaint but we gave the BBC a run for its taxpayers’ money in terms of the politics of misrepresentation.So why does this series feel a bit different in tone and content? It’s partly that television has extended its reach in the intervening years, with popular programmes such as Educating Essex and Educating Yorkshire, which have brought so many brilliant heads, teachers and young people into sympathetic view. There’s more than a hint of “Educating Bexley” about the new series. More generally, as a society, we’ve developed a keener understanding of the emotional component of learning – so there’s much less of the stiff BBC upper lip about 11-plus failure and more of a sense of the damaging effect of the test throughout secondary education – and not just on those who have failed.But the shift is partly down to politics. Theresa May’s rash decision in 2016 to put selection back on the agenda has angered and worried parents and teachers and united the educational world against her plans. A string of academic studies have undermined the old myths of the grammar lobby, still repeated here by Townley grammar’s headteacher, who says his job is “talent spotting” and seems to believe that selection is not a problem for neighbouring schools, and that clever teenagers can only achieve if segregated from most of their peers.In taking a broader, and powerfully human, view of the impact of selection, Grammar Schools: Who Will Get In? will surely put a further dent in government plans to expand grammar schools. Only in the final episode – when too much time is given over to the self justifications of Townley’s smooth-talking head – does it feel as if the programme makers lose their nerve. By then, I suspect, it is too late. Most viewers will already have made up their mind about this rotten system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c829830416e75ba155a003e98e533b1251a18009/491_186_3279_1968/master/3279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6174efee3a929c122ce57c174626d89","title":"rachel de souza vomit school controversy ofsted","story":"The newspapers couldn’t believe their luck. Last autumn, Barry Smith, headteacher of the new Great Yarmouth Charter Academy, issued policies on behaviour to parents and children. The predecessor school, he wrote, was riddled with indiscipline, bullying and truancy. He would not allow such things. Mobile phones, if seen or heard, would be confiscated for weeks. Pupils must “only ever look at your teacher or where your teacher has directed you to look”. Smith specified “unacceptable” boys’ haircuts including “variations on the style often known as ‘Meet me at McDonald’s’”, a tousled mop with short sides.Most remarkably, he told children not to feign illness to avoid work. “If you feel sick we will give you a bucket. If you vomit – no problem! … that’s probably all your body wanted.” After press headlines and angry parents’ protests, Smith modified his “behaviour guide”, parts of which were “tongue in cheek”, with the sick buckets being just “a colourful turn of phrase”.For Dame Rachel de Souza, founder and chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, the chain that runs the academy, the storm was just a routine day’s work. For a small (14 schools) chain, founded in 2013, the trust attracts disproportionate publicity. Some of it is positive. Though several schools required improvement or were in special measures before they joined, the Department for Education puts Inspiration second only to a chain that includes two grammar schools in a league table of multi-academy trusts’ Progress 8 scores. A study by the Education Policy Institute rates its key stage 4 results ahead of every other secondary provider in England, including local authorities. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, was so impressed with De Souza, a steelworker’s daughter from Scunthorpe, that he said he would like to clone her “23,000 times”.De Souza points out that it’s normal for schools to be shown draft Ofsted reports and for inspectors to make second visits after representations. Ministers, in any case, have no power to influence school inspections. So why does she attract so much controversy? “Probably because I think change is necessary and do things wholeheartedly,” she ventures. But several hostile stories, I observe, are based on leaked emails, which suggests she makes enemies among her colleagues. “There were a number of difficult relationships. Perhaps some people’s noses were put out of joint.”De Souza talks at 100mph sentences begin but never finish, as she interrupts herself with new thoughts and anecdotes. “I’m jumping all over the place,” she says.She taught at comprehensives in Oxford, east London and Luton before, at 36, landing her first academy headship, also in Luton. The school, replacing two local authority schools deemed to be “underperforming”, was so difficult that she told her senior team it would probably continue to fail and, at the end of the year, “we could all walk away and get on with our lives”. But for that one year, they should give it everything.“We went totally over the top on every little thing. We would tell them to do their revision and then have a banana. Revise, eat a banana, revise, eat a banana. Year 11 had never had a qualified maths teacher. So I found one and put them all in the hall with him and a stereo mic for two hours each night.” She ordered new uniforms, sent teachers to get children out of bed in the mornings, and introduced assemblies with classical music. Exam results soared.She describes the trust as “a family” with “a feeling of community”, exemplified by an annual “great day” in early September “where we get all the staff together”. Inspiration Trust, like several other academy chains, has a central team of “brilliant subject specialists” hammering out rigorous curriculum content. If a local authority were doing it, it would be described as dictatorial, particularly since there is a heavy emphasis on “core knowledge”, the latest curriculum fashion, which De Souza embraced after visiting ED Hirsch, its guru, in the US. But de Souza insists that the team works closely with teachers and that “we see ourselves as a scholarly community generating new knowledge”.Born in 1968, she had a “wonderful, colourful, interesting childhood”. Her father was Irish, her mother, half-Austrian, half-Hungarian. A Ukrainian step-grandfather encouraged her to learn the language at a Saturday school. At her Catholic school, she was a “very good” student up to 14 but became “quite sociable and not that interested in studying” until the second year at sixth form college. Her religious studies teacher had a degree from London University’s tiny Heythrop College, and De Souza decided to follow him. She met her future husband, now in the probation service, on her first day. “I thought: yes, that’s it.”With a degree in theology and philosophy, “I was advised to shake off my northern help-the-world thing and go and make some money.” She became a trainee accountant. “I thought it was the end of life.” After two weeks, she left to take a teaching certificate at King ’s College, London.Her career – five jobs in the past 15 years – suggests a certain restlessness. There were rumours in 2016 that she would succeed Michael Wilshaw as chief inspector. She laughs and denies that she applied.So what about the “vomit school”? More laughter. “What Barry’s done there is unbelievable,” she tells me. “It’s one of the best examples of sorting out behaviour I’ve ever seen. The guy is super-talented.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee5871057d629ff337881477367ac0f9a66ec857/0_0_6510_3906/master/6510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63315d35f9be745a2d47e0852e3ec5e8","title":"man begins six month swim through great pacific garbage patch","story":"Ben Lecomte hopes to make it from Japan to San Francisco in 180 days while raising awareness of plastic pollutionA French anti-plastic campaigner has begun a six-month journey to swim through the giant floating rubbish mass known as the Great Pacific garbage patch.Ben Lecomte, who has previously swum across the Atlantic Ocean in 1998, left the shores of Choshi in Japan on Tuesday morning, heading east.The 50-year-old plans to swim from Japan to San Francisco in 180 days, covering 8,000km. His journey will take him through 1,600km of the garbage patch, in an attempt to raise awareness about plastic pollution. The Great Pacific garbage patch, according to the latest March estimate, is twice the size of France and contains nearly 80,000 tonnes of plastic. Also known as the Pacific trash vortex, the patch is caused by the North Pacific gyre – a circle of currents that keep plastic, waste and other pollution trapped. According to scientists, the patch has been growing “exponentially” in recent years. The March estimate found it was 16 times larger than previously expected. Lecomte and his support team intend to sample the water they swim through every day of the journey, and gauge the level of plastic and microplastic pollution. The expedition’s first mate, Tyral Dalitz, told the ABC the team wanted to dispel a myth about the garbage patch. Rather than being made up of large pieces of plastic, most of the pollution is made up of invisible pieces of microplastic that sit in the water like a “plastic smog”, he said. “In reality the truth is much worse – the ocean is now filled with microplastics ... Rather than calling it an island of trash, it is more like plastic smog throughout the ocean.”The team will also be catching fish along the journey to track how plastic pollution accumulates within the food chain. To complete the journey Lecomte plans to swim for eight hours, or 50km, each day. He will use ocean currents to push him along and will wear a shark repellant bracelet. He told the ABC that the psychological factor was the hardest part. “It’s mind over matter … Sometimes that’s very difficult to do, when you are dry and sleepy and in pain, to jump in the water and to stay in that water for eight hours when it’s cold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeb7525c146fba902ce159ae4655c6d648500890/992_146_1561_936/master/1561.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbc45024c78fe90333354a096ecdb008","title":"andrej kramaric croatia hero principles dinamo zagreb zdravko mamic world cup","story":"Forward left Dinamo Zagreb rather than agreeing to Zdravko Mamic’s demands and is respected by fans of all clubs in CroatiaThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Andrej Kramaric has gone against the grain and, against sizeable odds, come out on top. The Hoffenheim forward has risked his career in sticking to his principles and now stands to shine for a Croatia side whose attack has often struggled for fluency.A recent court anecdote casts light on the forces Kramaric has had to battle. It also explains why Croatia have lost so much support at home, with players scorned rather than celebrated going into the World Cup.It centres on Zdravko Mamic, the most powerful man in domestic football. Mamic is on trial for, among other things, massive-scale embezzlement of Dinamo Zagreb’s funds. While at the club, he took big chunks of transfer money paid to Dinamo. That is not being disputed by Mamic’s lawyers. But the prosecution is trying to prove some of those clauses, including in the cases of Luka Modric and Dejan Lovren, were added and backdated only after the players had been sold. Modric and Lovren asserted that during the investigation but changed their testimonies in court as witnesses for the prosecution, saying the investigators had confused them. Modric has been charged with perjury and Lovren is being investigated for it. This has turned large sections of the public against the players.Among the papers Mamic submitted to court as “evidence of his innocence”, something was discovered: a document investigators claim was a list of instructions for Lovren on how to answer specific questions asked by the prosecution. Apparently he had followed those almost to the letter.Kramaric says he refused to follow in the more experienced players’ footsteps and sign such a contract. It nearly destroyed his career but he does not discuss it. “There is no need everyone knows what was happening and the stories you hear are true,” he said last year. “I came out of it with a smile on my face and made a success for myself. But of course it left a bitter taste. Dinamo was my dream ever since I was a kid.”The Zagreb-born youngster joined the club at six and scored 452 goals, by his count, for their youth teams. He was the best attacking talent their academy produced in decades and Mamic repeatedly approached Kramaric’s family, promising money and various perks if he came under his wing. The family declined and things were made difficult for Kramaric.Although he made a promising start for the first team, he would be benched at the first sign of a drop in form. He would be sent on loans to Lokomotiva, Dinamo’s farm club, and even after he did very well there Dinamo coaches tended to favour other players. Meanwhile the club declined inquiries from foreign clubs – hoping to break him into signing a contract with Mamic.But Kramaric did not buckle. In 2013 he went public with complaints about a lack of playing time, his father insinuating it related to their refusal to go with Mamic. He was transfer-listed and Rijeka signed him.There, Kramaric revived his career. He scored 27 goals in his first season and 28 the next. This attracted Leicester City, who made him their record signing in January 2015. He was 23, far beyond the age at which most Croatian talents make their big moves.Kramaric did not succeed in England. After Leicester had won their relegation battle, he barely featured and was loaned to Hoffenheim in winter 2016, missing the Foxes’ title win. “The other lads took their chances and I had to take the hard road,” he said. “Again.”Again he flourished, this time under Julian Nagelsmann, especially after signing permanently. In 2016-17 he won the player of the year award from Hoffenheim fans at the end of the most recent season, he made Kicker magazine’s Bundesliga team of the season.His international career has been only slightly less arduous. Since his debut in 2014 he has not fully established himself in competition with Mario Mandzukic and Nikola Kalinic but has been able to unlock the team’s largely dormant attacking potential. He became a hero with both goals in the 2-0 win in Ukraine that took Croatia to the World Cup play-offs.But, far beyond that, Kramaric has become a symbol of a refusal to go with the flow and support the powers that have alienated so many fans. He is different, on and off the pitch – respected by fans, regardless of the club they support and whether they can muster any enthusiasm for Croatia. It is perhaps Kramaric’s greatest achievement.Aleksandar Holiga writes for Telesport.Follow him on Twitter here. Click here for our Croatia team guide.

Voted “Best in the World” at the 1994 World Cup a leader, good on his line. If he was playing today, he’d be in the top three in the world.Eric Gerets is my right-back. The first Belgian to win the European Cup. A top player, with great determination and a real leader. Laurent Verbiest would be my first centre-back. He was known as ‘Lorenzo the Magnificent’, a talented libero, 20 or 30 years ahead of his time. He died tragically at 27 in a car crash. Alongside him, I’ve gone for Vincent Kompany. An example to everyone. Vincent’s come back from many injuries and that shows his mental strength. A first-class person and a legend at Manchester City he was a candidate to captain my team. On the left, it has to be Jean Thissen. He won two European Cup Winners’ Cups with Anderlecht good in the air, a terrific attitude and a great left foot.At No 6, I’d have Wilfried Van Moer. He could tackle, create and score goals. He suffered a horrific broken leg against Italy in 1972 but was recalled to the international team in his 30s and was instrumental in taking Belgium to the 1980 European Championship final. At No 10 I’d have Enzo Scifo. He was blessed with an excellent football brain, had fantastic passing ability and was strong and two-footed. One of the greatest. Jan Ceulemans and Eden Hazard complete my midfield.Ceulemans is my captain. A real team player, he had a phenomenal career, playing in five major tournaments from 1980 to 1990. Shy off the pitch, he nonetheless played with a “never say die” attitude. Ceulemans could have joined any of Europe’s big clubs but chose to stay in Belgium. On the left side of midfield, Hazard can do anything, even on an off-day he can make the difference in a game. He’s a fantastic guy, always smiling. Together with Scifo, one of Belgium’s top talents in the last 30 years. My first striker is the “White Pelé”, Paul Van Himst. Elegant on and off the pitch and unbelievably talented. One of the top five Belgians ever. Alongside him, I’d have Romelu Lukaku. I was thinking about Erwin Vandenbergh, but my vote went to Lukaku. He’s had an incredible career and he’s still only 24. Scores for fun and he’s been playing first-team football week-in, week-out, since he was 16. He always works his socks off to improve. Without Lukaku, I don’t think José Mourinho would still be the manager at Manchester United.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff68bc5cef4df3598b9910c4c1bc9139d4fa7d6/0_419_3777_2266/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed0b914142bda24a5db5fa371f0e67c","title":"a beginners guide to the world cup 2018 when does the world cup start","story":"From when does the World Cup start to who’s likely to win football’s greatest prize – the 2018 tournament explainedThe Fifa World Cup is an international football tournament contested by 32 nations every four years.

Fifa has 211 national association affiliates spread across six different confederations around the globe.Did any traditionally “big” countries not make it?England were the only “home nation” to qualify, while Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all failed with varying degrees of predictability. The USA, the Netherlands, South American champions Chile, Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon and the four-times World Cup winners Italy are among the most high profile nations to miss out on qualification for Russia 2018. For many international powerhouses, qualifying is invariably little more than a formality. For others it is an incredible achievement.Iceland will contest their first World Cup finals this summer and with a population of just 335,000 are the smallest country to qualify in the history of the competition.How will a winner be decided from those who did make the cut?The 32 countries have already been drawn into eight groups of four teams which will be decided on a round robin basis. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages, which is when things start to get really tense.What happens if any of these knockout matches end in a draw?If the sides are level after 90 minutes, they play an additional 30 minutes of extra time.And if they’re still level?The outcome is decided by a penalty shoot-out. There have been 26 in World Cup finals history and both Brazil (1994) and Italy (2006) have actually won finals by this very stressful method.Who is expected to win this year’s tournament?It’s a tough one to call. Germany are the holders and are expected to be in the shake-up again, while Brazil, France, Spain and Argentina are other former winners who many expect to do well.Have England ever won the World Cup?Once, in 1966 and they’re still dining out on it over 50 years later.Tell me more ...As tournament hosts, they beat Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium to win the Jules Rimet Trophy.The what now?The Jules Rimet Trophy. It was originally called Victory but later renamed in honour of the Fifa president who dreamt up the World Cup. Brazil got to keep it after winning it for the third time in 1970, but it was stolen 13 years later and has never been returned.So what do the winners get now?Acclaim, medals, hero status in their homeland and a hefty financial bonus from their national Football Association. They also get presented with the Fifa World Cup trophy, which is just shy of 37 centimetres in height and weighs 6.1 kilograms. Made of 18 carat gold with a malachite base, it depicts two human figures holding up the earth. It is arguably the most iconic trophy in all of sport.Such a popular event must generate a lot of cash. Who gets it all?Anything else I should know?This year’s tournament will be the first World Cup in which Video Assistant Referees (VAR) will be used to help referees avoid making potentially match-deciding mistakes when it comes to such important issues as awarding goals, penalties or doling out red cards. It will also referees avoid cases of mistaken identity, as has been known to happen from time to time.Sounds like a good idea ...It certainly does in theory, but many are predicting disaster once it’s put into practice. VAR has been tested in a number of tournaments around the world, often with hilarious consequences and a number of referees will arrive in Russia with no prior experience of using it. While Fifa are confident it will be a success, many doom-mongers are predicting that VAR could become the main, unwelcome talking point of Russia 2018.If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning Uruguay as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Argentina in their qualifying group.”If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I not say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning England as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Scotland in their qualifying group.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821ca56d9279a90f33c97d5b4905a3c98d5fb7ae/1007_1987_946_567/master/946.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=177400fddc6d29db3f63ebb28f7f0cd0","title":"female garment workers gap hm south asia","story":"Clothing companies to investigate allegations that fast fashion deadlines create climate of harassment and violence in Asian factoriesPressure to meet fast fashion deadlines is leading to women working in Asian factories supplying Gap and H\u0026ampM being sexually and physically abused, according to unions and rights groups.More than 540 workers at factories that supply the two retailers have described incidents of threats and abuse, according to two separate reports published last week by Global Labour Justice on gender-based violence in Gap and H\u0026ampM’s garment supply chains.The reports claim that these allegations, recorded between January and May this year in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, are a direct result of pressure for quick turnarounds and low overheads.Publication of the reports comes as negotiations are being held this week at the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to tackle workplace harassment. Tola Moeun, director of Central Cambodia, an NGO involved in the research, said abuse was a daily reality for female garment workers driven to meet unrealistic targets in H\u0026ampM and Gap’s supply chains. “Most of these cases are not reported due to fear of retaliation in the workplace.”Gap and H\u0026ampM both told the  they would investigate the allegations and that they welcomed initiatives to tackle violence, including an ILO convention.Jennifer Rosenbaum, US director of Global Labour Justice, said: “We must understand gender-based violence as an outcome of the global supply chain structure. H\u0026ampM and Gap’s fast fashion supply chain model creates unreasonable production targets and underbid contracts, resulting in women working unpaid overtime and working very fast under extreme pressure. “Unions and many governments agree an ILO convention on gender-based violence is essential, although there is still opposition from some employers.”H\u0026ampM lists 235 Indian garment factories among its suppliers, the report says. In one dispute last month in a Bangalore factory over wages and working conditions, a female tailor said to researchers that she was grabbed by the hair and punched, then told: “You whore, your caste people should be kept where the slippers are kept.”One worker in another H\u0026ampM supplier factory told researchers she was beaten as punishment for not meeting production quotas. At an H\u0026ampM supplier factory in Sri Lanka, one woman complained: “When girls scold machine operators for touching them or grabbing them, they take revenge. Sometimes they give them machines that don’t function properly. Then they don’t come and repair it for a long time. After that, supervisors scold us for not meeting the target.”In a factory supplying Gap in Indonesia, a woman talked about daily being called stupid, mocked for not working faster and threatened with contract termination.“They also throw materials. They kick our chairs. They don’t touch us, so they don’t leave a mark that could be used as evidence with the police,” she said.Debbie Coulter, of the Ethical Trading Initiative, of which both Gap and H\u0026ampM are members, said: “These allegations are deeply concerning. Gender-based violence is unacceptable under any circumstances, and brands need to make sure that women working in their supply chain are protected.“We expect H\u0026ampM and Gap to investigate these allegations, and to work with supplier factories so that any women affected have swift access to remedy. “ETI will be in regular contact with these members and will offer support where appropriate to ensure a swift resolution for all workers affected.”In an email, H\u0026ampM told the : “All forms of abuse or harassment are against everything that H\u0026ampM group stands for. Violence against women is one of the most prevalent human rights violations. Gender-based violence makes women all around the world suffer daily and undermines their health, dignity and security. This is why we welcome any initiative strengthening the human rights of women at work, such as the international convention against gender-based violence in the workplace being discussed within the ILO.“We will go through every section of the report and follow-up on factory level with our local teams based in each production country.”Gap said it was “deeply concerned” about the allegations and was now conducting due diligence to investigate and address these issues.“We are committed to making sure that the people who make our clothes work in safe conditions and are treated with respect. We’ve consolidated our supplier base to focus on partners that share our values and goals, and an increasing number of factories we source from are audited by ILO’s Better Work programme. “Our Code of Vendor Conduct, which closely aligns with our environmental and human rights policies, prohibits any form of discrimination. We conduct assessments of our branded apparel suppliers on a regular basis to ensure compliance, and when we encounter any discriminatory or retaliatory practices in our supply chain, we require that our suppliers promptly remediate the situation.“Gap Inc agrees that gender-based workplace violence is a significant issue and an appropriate subject for ILO action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ba1b4478a645c24368206d88226fe6bb9aeb/0_2341_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cd64528d9fda56945345fb9997e0f49","title":"nigel slater kohlrabi with tomatoes recipe","story":"A vegetarian recipe that can serve as a main course or side dishTrim a large kohlrabi, removing any leaves, then slice very thinly.

Try not to let the slices colour past the palest gold.Transfer the kohlrabi to a warm serving plate then put 150g of small tomatoes in the hot pan and let them cook for 5 to 7 minutes until soft. Crush them with the back of a spoon as they cook, so their juice forms a loose dressing in the pan.While the tomatoes are cooking, remove the leaves from a bunch of basil – you will need 10g of leaves – then put them into a blender with 5 tbsp of olive oil and process to a bright green, thickish dressing. Check the seasoning – it may need a grind of salt.Spoon the tomatoes and their juices over the slices of kohlrabi, then pour the dressing over and serve immediately. Enough for 2 as a main course, 4 as a side dish.The basil oil and the juices from the tomatoes combine on the plate to form a loose dressing. You need some chewy, open-textured bread, such as sourdough, with which to mop them up. I tend to slice the kohlrabi thinly so it cooks quickly, browning it very lightly, as it tends to become a little bitter if overcooked.The tomato and basil dressing will work with other vegetables, especially thin slices of cauliflower, fried or grilled until lightly crisp, or butternut squash, finely sliced and fried.

The BBC took over the building in the 1930s and refurbished it to serve as studios, making it one of the broadcaster’s oldest buildings. However, the distinctive and unusual building is in a residential area and contains asbestos, increasing the cost of refurbishment.“I understand how much our musical heritage at Maida Vale means to us, to artists and to audiences,” the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said in a note to staff. “We haven’t taken this decision lightly. But we’re determined to ensure that live music remains at the heart of the BBC and moving to this new development gives us the opportunity to do just that.”Maida Vale was the site of Bing Crosby’s last recording session and has hosted tens of thousands live music events for BBC radio stations, ranging from John Peel sessions to Radio 1’s Live Lounge recordings. It was also the home of the experimental BBC Radiophonic Workshop, where Delia Derbyshire recorded the Doctor Who theme tune.The BBC hopes to relocate most of Maida Vale’s functions to a new complex in the Stratford Waterfront development in the Olympic Park by 2023. The site will contain recording and rehearsal studios, providing a purpose-built base for the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the BBC Singers, as well as being used regularly by the BBC Concert Orchestra. The broadcaster has pledged to run music sessions in east London schools as well as making digital music resources available to schools everywhere. The BBC will also partner with local education groups on other music projects.James Purnell, the BBC’s director of radio and education, said: “This proposed new building will act as a magnet for music development in east London and will allow us to share our music facilities and expertise with local, erse communities as well as being a much better place for our brilliant music staff to work from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad91540d4d7cdfb521640624e1130f1f59066005/1940_303_1073_644/master/1073.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=defde30cb4d764eb26dddf80e8393110","title":"junk food ad ban could cost tv industry 200m says channel 4","story":"Broadcaster argues proposed pre-watershed ban, backed by Jamie Oliver, is anachronisticChannel 4 bosses have said Jamie Oliver is wrong to campaign for a ban on airing junk food adverts before 9pm, arguing that it is anachronistic because children rarely watch live television.The celebrity chef, who is one of Channel 4’s biggest stars, recently launched a campaign backed by Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon for a ban on TV advertising for food high in salt, fat or sugar before the watershed, arguing that such products are a cause of childhood obesity.However, Channel 4 said any such ban could have a substantial impact on its revenue and prevent it from funding programmes about healthy living.Alex Mahon, the Channel 4 chief executive, said that if such ads were restricted on mainstream television, junk food advertisers would instead spend their money with the likes of Facebook and “target young people even more specifically”.“None of us want childhood obesity in the UK,” she said. “We’re just saying on this particularly point we need a slightly more complex consultation.”Jonathan Allan, the channel’s chief commercial officer, said a ban could take £200m out of the commercial television industry.“It’s a serious financial risk for broadcasters,” he said. “We feel the 9pm watershed is probably not proportionate because it would stop advertising around shows that don’t appeal to kids at all. It is potentially anachronistic when children are watching on-demand at any time of the day.”The news may disappoint Oliver, who made Jamie’s School Dinners for the channel in 2005, when he helped focus media attention on children’s diets by launching a war on Turkey twizzlers.“Jamie is obviously free to have his agenda,” said Allan. “We fund and commission loads of great shows about health and if we’ve got less money we can afford to put less shows like that out.”Channel 4 launched its annual report on Tuesday, the first under its new leadership team of Mahon and director of programmes Ian Katz, a former Newsnight boss and deputy editor of the . They have pledged to focus on attracting a younger audience with investments into E4 and online programming.The commercial broadcaster, which is ultimately publicly owned, said revenues fell from £995m to £960m in 2017, amid a weak advertising market. It is looking to move a substantial part of its operation outside London as part of a deal with the government to spend more money on programmes produced away from the capital.Channel 4 announced a deal with Vice to bring hundreds of hours of programming to its All 4 catchup service by the end of the year.

Since winning top social artist at 2017’s Billboard music awards, they have been muscling into America’s – and indeed the west’s – consciousness with their genre-hopping music and intricate visual narratives.Overall, the slick, highly trained K-pop groups have slowly but surely gained traction in the west over the years. In 2012, the US-based Korean pop culture convention, KCON, drew an audience of 10,000. Last year, that figure was 149,000, but the US and UK music industries have remained oblivious to the phenomenon, or unconvinced that a record sung in Korean could ever find an English-speaking audience large enough to compete with their homegrown artists.That theory is now shattered by BTS’s success, and the spotlight is now on South Korean pop, a fast-paced, riveting and fertile industry but one with its own rules and lexicon that isn’t always simple to navigate. This is your essential guide to who’s who and what’s what in K-Pop.Record labels, such as Universal and Sony, exist in Korea, but the entertainment agency is king and key names include JYP, YG, SM, Cube, Pledis, Starship and FNC. They audition and train hundreds of teenagers before placing a select few into new “idol” groups. Agencies also do everything in-house: management, PR, A\u0026ampR, production and concertsevents. Founded in 2005 by Bang Sihyuk, a former JYP songwriter, he debuted BTS in 2013, who turned Big Hit into the most profitable agency in South Korea, with a market value estimated at $1.85bn (£1.38bn). BTS – rappers RM, Suga and J-hope, and vocalists Jimin, Jungkook, Jin and V – are rewriting the rules of K-pop, with their new single Fake Love taking the highest ever position (No 10) by a Korean group on the US Billboard Hot 100.A new release. Groups make multiple comebacks (usually several EPs) each year to maintain and grow their fanbases. The album and single drop simultaneously and though there are exceptions, it’s one single per comeback. C is also for choreography, a vital K-pop ingredient, and idol groups practise endlessly to execute flawless, complex routines.If hip-hop has beef, then K-Pop has drama, and a lot of it. Idols embroiled in a scandal (anything from a display of bad manners to being outed as dating) is a regular occurrence, but for consistent drama, look to the fandoms. Fandom rivalry stretches back to K-Pop’s first generation in the 90s where physical fights took place, while these days, there are small but noisy pockets of EXO EXO-l fans and BTS’s Army who are infamous for their online spats. Fandoms fighting internally is also commonplace.There’s little to rival the experimentation of K-pop. From mashing together sounds, whether it be pop, rock, hip-hop, reggae, EDM, Latin or jazz, to the idols’ hair, makeup and styling (BDSM harnesses and mullets, anyone?), there’s always something to hook your eyes and ears. Fans, also known as stans, generally dedicate themselves to one group only. The relationship between fandom and group runs deep both ways, so you’ll often see idols cry or do a floor bow at concerts as they thank fans for their support.K-Pop is a fluid beast that cherrypicks influences from a multitude of genres, which are then altered or combined to suit a group’s concept. Popular high concepts for groups include hip-hop, school days, cute, girl crush, sexy and retro.K-Pop is just one part of the hallyu (Korean wave), a term that’s been used since 1999 to encompass all of Korea’s cultural exports, including television dramas and films.K-pop stars are known as idols, and often start training in an agency from a young age having been scouted or auditioned. Unlike western celebrities, idols are expected to behave impeccably on stage and off, which includes no dating. They can be penniless for years as their agency recoups the cost of training and debuting, but there are hugely lucrative opportunities from advertising deals and sponsorships. Older groups (10+ years active), such as Bigbang, SHINee, Girls’ Generation, Shinwha and Sechs Kies, remain popular, while the most talked-about current groups include Twice, Wanna One, EXO and BTS.Agencies continue to heavily court this cash-rich market, re-recording songs or releasing original material for specifically for Japanese audiences.K-pop in its modern form began in 1992 with Seo Taiji and Boys (one of whom was Yang Hyun-suk, who went on to form YG Entertainment) – they rattled the public with their sociopolitical lyrics and musicality that was indebted to new jack swing and the Beastie Boys. K-pop is often broken down into generations, although the time brackets for each are hotly contested, making it debatable whether we’re in the third or fourth generation of idols. Some of the most widely covered cases are idols trying to extricate themselves from iron-clad contracts, with some cases dragging on for years. Meanwhile, Korean law allows for people to be sued for defamatory comments even if they are true, so agencies often threaten anti-fans who post negative comments online with legal action. A good MV (music video) is just as important as a good song in K-pop and making a standard video doesn’t leave much change from $100,000. MVs deemed expensive cost more than $200,000, while there’s even a couple that ran to US$1m. Some of the best producers are Lumpens, VM Project Architecture, Zanybros, Digipedi, Tigercave and Studio Naive.Agencies frequently sign producers and songwriters such as Bumzu (Pledis), Teddy Park (YG) or Kenzie (SM) to work exclusively on their acts, but there are plenty of independent Korean creatives and a significant international presence on K-pop records, such as Brits LDN Noise, Swedes Caesar \u0026amp Loui and Andreas Öberg, and Americans such as Kevin Randolph, Davey Nate, and the LA-based collective Devine-Channel. Some of the best known Koreans include Shinsadong Tiger, Primary, Slow Rabbit, Pdogg, Brave Brothers, Sweetune and Black Eyed Pilseung. All new groups are known as rookies, and the consensus is that you remain a rookie for around two years. The term monster rookie is used for groups (usually from bigger agencies) who find significant early success, such as NCT, Gfriend and Blackpink. When smaller agencies debut an act, they are frequently referred to as “nugu groups” nugu is Korean for “who”, but also used to describe someone as a nobody.Sasaengs are the obsessed fans who have been known to break into idols’ houses, put recording devices in hotel rooms, pay off staff at phone or flight companies for an star’s number or book seats next to their bias (favourite member) and crash private events, such as weddings. The legendary idol-training system is a gruelling schedule of, primarily, vocal and dance lessons. A pre-dawn start and witching-hour finish is routine. Three years is an average training period, but this can be as long as eight years. R\u0026ampB singer G.Soul holds the record for the longest training period, an endurance-testing 15 years. A broadcasting app and website that idol groups use to communicate in real time with fans, as well as load prerecorded shows. V Live records every broadcast, so that they or the fans can add subtitles afterwards, helping international fans stay connected.That many K-pop self-proclaimed “world tours” tend to exclude half the world is a long-running fan joke. The consistent focus has been on Asia and North America but, in recent years, K-pop’s ever-growing popularity has seen more tours play Australia, Europe and South America, where there’s been huge surges of interest.Like everywhere else, racism is a significant issue in Korea, and prejudice is often rife in the entertainment industry. Blackface is still used on mainstream comedy skit shows appropriation of black culture, including gestures, language and hair, can be seen regularly in K-pop (and groups including Block B, Big Bang, EXO, GOT7 and 4Minute have all encountered international criticism for doing so) while darker skin is also seen as a negative trait, with companies, fans and media whitewashing idol images (making them appear lighter skinned than they are in reality).Agencies and Korean broadcast companies make heavy use of YouTube, but the platform is a goldmine of fan-made content: compilation videos, playlists, subtitled content (lyrics, idol reality and variety shows), vlogsreactions, fancams from concerts and appearances and ripped Korea-only shows. Without these, K-pop’s global expansion would have been far slower.Being a little crazy helps. Appearing on Korea’s popular variety shows is a great way of raising an idol’s profile as well as that of their group, but these are tough gigs that require quick wit, charm and a willingness to get involved in anything-goes situations. Idols with “4D” (eccentric or sassy) personalities do especially well, like BTS’s V, Exid’s Hani, GOT7’s Jackson, and Super Junior’s Hee-chul. Knowing Brothers, Running Man, Weekly Idol and Netflix’s new original Busted are just some of the shows to watch.

The delay of the document, which was intended to put the UK on the front foot in negotiations but is said to still be “riddled with red ink”, underlines the deep ides that continue to exist in cabinet over customs plans and the Irish border. May’s spokesman was unable to say whether the white paper, expected to include detail on areas including financial services, security and dispute settlement, would be ready by the Brussels summit. “I’ve not put a timeframe on it, other than we will bring it forward as soon as possible,” he said.No 10 said the June summit was simply a “staging post” towards Brexit while other government sources suggested that the EU would primarily be seeking progress on the so-called backstop option.Edwin Morgan, head of media relations at the Institute of Directors, which was represented at the talks, added: “Businesses need clarity about the government’s objectives to help them to plan. Everything is still subject to negotiation with the EU, but we don’t yet know what the UK will pushing for in key areas like customs. “Our members want to know whether the government’s forthcoming white paper will make clear their intentions on VAT, customs and regulatory alignment – to understand in what areas ministers foresee continued harmonisation with EU rules, and where they want freedom to erge.”It has been reported that the UK may seek to stay inside the EU’s VAT area after Brexit, which would require the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, one of May’s red lines.The business leaders were also said to have warned the prime minister that maintaining frictionless trade with the EU after Brexit was probably more important than the imposition of any tariffs.After the meeting, a No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister provided an update on the negotiations … setting out plans to provide greater detail of the future relationship in a white paper due to be published shortly. “The business representatives expressed their support for this approach, which will build on information provided through the prime minister’s various speeches.“Brexit secretary David Davis, chancellor Philip Hammond, business secretary Greg Clark and trade secretary Liam Fox were also at the meeting. Meanwhile the prime minister will attempt to overturn all 15 of the House of Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill in one sitting when it returns tothe Commons next week.May will aim to get her flagship Brexit legislation through in just 12 hours next Tuesday with MPs warned they will be voting into the early hours.Conservative MPs have been told by their chief whip to be on site “at all times” for the votes, with party managers fearing they could face several defeats.The prime minister is reliant on the Democratic Unionist party to push through her Brexit agenda, but could struggle to overturn key amendments including on themeaningful vote and the customs union, although the wording of thiswould not necessitate a shift in policy.The Labour whips’ office criticised the move in a comment on Twitter, saying that holding all of the votes on one day was “an absolute disgrace” and “must be out of sheer panic”.It added that the Commons “has had nothing to do for months in terms of substantive business and to try to ram through in one day shows the contempt that the government have for the role of parliament”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1652a780c71afad9e03bc5be7f1f7f8ce157a820/0_0_3258_1955/master/3258.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07678f8ce8a5ec8a1ae5e0b32fa6f2e7","title":"brexit weekly briefing pressure just keeps piling on theresa may","story":"Three weeks until EU summit and no workable solutions on Irish border and customs unionWelcome to the ’s weekly Brexit briefing.

Nothing suggests the government will be able to do so.The Brexit secretary, David Davis, sort of had a bash, reportedly mooting an entirely unworkable post-Brexit customs fudge whereby Northern Ireland would have both EU and UK status plus a 10-mile “buffer zone” between it and the Republic to avoid border checks, but No 10 was quick to knock it down.Officially, the cabinet is still “refining” two potential customs solutions: the so-called customs partnership, under which the UK would collect import duties on behalf of the EU, and its more technology-focused “max-fac” alternative – both of which the EU has already rejected as unworkable. A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Sadly, Brussels is also deeply suspicious of Theresa May’s “backstop” plan to leave the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU until the Irish border issue is solved. So conversations over dinner in Brussels on 28 June are set to be lively, and unproductive. Increasingly, it looks like crunch time will be October’s EU summit.Meanwhile, top European industrialists warned the prime minister that time was fast running out if she wanted to ensure post-Brexit trade was as frictionless as in a customs union. The influential Open Europe thinktank said the UK should accept continued EU regulations in goods in return for single market access:Further raising the pressure on the beleaguered May, ex-cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Damian Green told her she must ignore extremist minorities on Brexit and listen instead to moderate voices in her party arguing for a “pragmatic approach” and “sensible” deal.Still, if you believe the government and Brexiters (and why wouldn’t you?) at least we won’t risk Armageddon if we leave without a deal. A leaked Whitehall report predicting the port of Dover would collapse and food, fuel and medicine run out within days was dismissed as “false”, “hysterical” and “fear on speed”.Faced with that leaked Whitehall report on the cataclysmic consequences of a no-deal Brexit, the  says it is high time for realism - on both sides:The costs of Brexit will largely be borne by the British but some will fall on the EU27 as well. It is in no one’s interests to have Britain decline into a sullen and impoverished island locked for decades into a bitter and interminable argument with itself over who was to blame for its condition, like a orced man drinking alone in a bedsit. Who would want that for a neighbour? The first requirement is realism, on both sides. Britain’s stances towards Brexit at the moment are based on self-delusion. But at the same time, the EU cannot expect that a future British government will see the error of its ways and come back begging for forgiveness and a fresh start. The worse the consequences of Brexit become, the more the leavers will blame them on unreasonable foreigners. Nor will this kind of nationalist rage against Brussels be confined to the UK.In the Independent, Andrew Grice argues that Donald Trump’s tariff war has strengthened the case for a customs union with the EU: The Brexiteers will argue that it would be easier for the UK to reach agreement with the US than to wait for a EU-US deal with 28 varying EU interests to accommodate. Eurosceptics insist that allowing the EU to continue to negotiate the UK’s trade agreements after Brexit would be even worse than EU membership, since we would have no influence over them. But Brussels has promised Britain consultation on future trade deals the EU would negotiate on the UK’s behalf if it stayed in a customs union. That looks increasingly like the right course. The Foreign Office’s mantra is to “hug the US close”. Trump’s actions prove that it’s time to rewrite it, and accept that to “hug the EU close” after Brexit is now in the national interest.Germany’s Brexit czar is not optimistic for the June summit, and reckons October is going to be an almighty scramble:"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn backs calls for inquiry into islamophobia in conservative party politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenAs we switch from customs to Chris Grayling, here is a tweet from Peter Ricketts, the former head of the Foreign Office, neatly linking the two topics.This is what Jon Thompson, the HMRC chief executive and permanent secretary, told the committee earlier (see 11.18am) when asked what the cost to business would be of a no deal Brexit. He said stressed that this was not the government’s preferred option. But he went on:Thompson says HMRC has worked with internet service providers to stop people receiving fake HMRC phishing emails. He says it estimates that it has prevented 500m of these emails being sent out.HMRC never sends out emails inviting people to click links, he says.They were due to cover economic crime, but Nicky Morgan says they will address that on another occasion.He asks about the revelation that HMRC made a reference to Lycamobile making a donation to the Conservative party when HMRC wrote to the French authorities refusing to raid Lycamobile’s London office on their behalf.Thompson says HMRC has reviewed all requests for help from other tax authorities. There around 260 a year. That review showed there were no other references to political donors.He says the person who included that reference made a mistake. But in other respects the reply to the French authorities was excellent, he says.He says the reply stressed HMRC’s need to comply with the law.Nicky Morgan says she was surprised to read a recent Times article saying HMRC is employing 2,000 fewer people than at the time of the EU referendum.Thompson says there was an assumption that digitisation would reduce the need for staff.He says he has described that assumption as over-aggressive.Thompson says HMRC has continued to ask for permission to have discussion with other tax authorities about systems after Brexit.But at the moment all negotiations are with the EU, he says.Q: You says, under the new customs partnership plan, there would be no checks. Presumably you mean no customs checks - not all checks. There could be checks for sanitary reason, couldn’t there?Harra confirms that. He says HMRC has been focusing on checks for the purposes of tariffs and VAT.Q: The Sunday Times at the weekend said a no deal Brexit could result in “armageddon”. How do you provide reassurance in the light of that?Karen Wheeler, director general of the cross-government border delivery group at HMRC, says that story referred to a report she has not seen. It is not something she recognises, she says.Her group is trying to minimise risks.Thompson says, if such a report exists, he has not seen it.Q: You said HMRC would be able to have a functioning border by January 2021, even though new arrangements might not be fully optional. And you said one of three things would have to give: security, revenue or trade. So would that really be a functioning border.Thompson says he did tell the committee two weeks ago that there would be a border, but that it would be sub-optimal.Q: We can’t compromise on security or trade, so we will have to compromise on revenue. How much might that cost?Thompson says that question is too hypothetical to answer. But ministers would have to make a choice, he says.Harra says customs procedures always have to balance out these three objectives. Thompson says HMRC is only one department of several looking at customs options.He says HMRC is not the primary author of government papers on the two options being considered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a73a961f4d855ff2079232afffe59b448703294/47_67_2470_1482/master/2470.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b8d81c0f854731fd001cf596b855983","title":"how ed smith has performed so far england cricket","story":"England’s new national selector has made a positive start with a modest reboot but being ruthless when requiredVictory, and clarity Ed Smith’s first Test in charge left him badly needing a win in the second match. He helped secure it by keeping faith with 10 of his first XI while showing a necessary ruthlessness by dropping Mark Stoneman (just as he had with James Vince). “Mark,” Smith said, “has experienced a disappointing start to the season and had a difficult Test match at Lord’s.” He struck the right balance between bluntness and empathy, and avoided the trap that lies in wait for anyone employed by the England and Wales Cricket Board: blathering jargon.A modest reboot Without making many unforced changes Smith has given the Test team a different tinge. When Jack Leach was injured Smith sprang a surprise by summoning another Somerset spinner, Dom Bess. Boyishly eager and undaunted, he has been a Bess of fresh air. Even his bowling, anodyne at Lord’s, blossomed at Headingley. It is hard to imagine him giving Virat Kohli nightmares in August but he can start googling the sights of Sri Lanka. Smith’s bravest choice has been Jos Buttler, airlifted straight from the Indian Premier League. It looked like backfiring when Buttler nicked off for 14 at Lord’s but then he made a classy 67, often standing outside his crease, a ploy that several team‑mates aped at Headingley. Buttler added a memorable unbeaten 80, scoring fast, then slowly and finally at IPL speed. If Stuart Broad’s batting had not fallen apart, Buttler would have collected a first Test hundred.By promoting Sam Curran when Ben Stokes was injured Smith repeated his trick with Bess – injecting youthful energy and cheerful multitasking. One could see England’s mood change: Joe Root, who got in a fretful muddle at Lord’s with his field placings, was all smiles.The right amount of intellect Smith is the most educated selection supremo of the past half-century. While his predecessors left school for the county circuit or National Service he went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to get a first in history. On Tuesday night, back in Cambridge, he is giving a lecture entitled “Why sport belongs to the humanities as much as to the sciences”. Smith’s brainpower has sometimes been resented in the dressing room, where a lot of learning is a dangerous thing. So it has been refreshing – even to a friend of his – to see him play it down this summer. At his first press conference he said there were no great principles at work, just the desire to win. This was probably two-thirds true. There are themes: he likes cricketers with flair, with “unique qualities” (as he said of Buttler) andor a strong temperament, hence his admiration for Alastair Cook and preference for Keaton Jennings. So far Smith has played the former journalist – pragmatic, armed with the facts – rather than the intellectual. At 40 he may be wise enough not to be too clever. A certain presence A few former cricketers, hovering on the outfield before the start, look uncomfortable in their civvies – either forced into a suit and tie, if working for Sky, or going too far the other way, as in Michael Vaughan’s T-shirt under a blazer, or Geoff Boycott’s lifelong attachment to the short-sleeved shirt. Smith is a sharp dresser who may have been the first Times leader writer with a sideline in menswear features. He wears a suit for fun. And when the cameras find him sitting on a balcony, he is in grey-rimmed sunglasses which allow him to be inscrutable while exuding a certain presence. This is not something ever got from Alec Bedser.Fine-tune the batting Dawid Malan was the only Pom to leave Australia with an enhanced reputation apart from the commentator Alison Mitchell. But he is less impressive in England, where his reluctance to go forward makes him vulnerable to the moving ball. In seven home Tests he averages only 21. The jury is out on Stoneman’s replacement as opener, Jennings, who was purposeful at Headingley but fell for 29 to a routine nibble. And the two keepers, Buttler and Jonny Bairstow, may be the wrong way round: the one with the gloves is two places higher, thus getting a shorter rest and less chance to make runs.Find a fast bowler After being outgunned in Australia England turned back to Mark Wood. That continued at Lord’s even though the alternative, Chris Woakes, has a far better record in England. Wood is rapid but, while struggling with injury, has mislaid the ability to bother top batsmen. So it proved at Lord’s, though it did not help that Root had him bowling Bodyline. Smith reacted by recalling Woakes, who showed some glaring rust before taking four wickets. The challenge remains: find a bowler fast enough to trouble good players on flat tracks, not to mention a top-class spinner. But Smith has made his mark. As a player he swam in his first Test before sinking in the next two as a selector he has already reversed that. This time he should last more than half a summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27c9aa138ae9c739ef8799f12719b585d31e9fd1/321_312_4570_2742/master/4570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85839952a10be6bdd53dea7d25eded9d","title":"talking horses itv4 to experiment with friday evening horse racing","story":"Newcastle’s fixture will provide sports-hungry viewers with something to watch on the first dark day of the World CupITV Racing is hoping to benefit from sports-hungry viewers next month when the first blank day of the World Cup comes around on Friday 29 June. ITV4 is to screen that evening’s racing from Newcastle, when the track stages a useful card on the eve of the Northumberland Plate, and ITV staff hope for another success to follow its coverage of Brigadier Gerard night at Sandown last month.From a racing fan’s perspective, it’s interesting and encouraging to see a broadcaster trying something new with the sport, rather than relying purely on the tried and tested regime of Saturday afternoons. (Full disclosure: I did a very little bit of work for ITV Racing last year.)The hope, I gather, is that this new evening’s coverage will get a mention or two on ITV the previous night, when that channel is screening England’s last group game against Belgium. “ITV4 are thrilled with the racing and the coverage it’s given them,” Paul Cooper, ITV’s deputy racing editor told me. “They very kindly supported us when we wanted to do Sandown. That went well, so we wanted to try a Friday night and this Newcastle card was the strongest one on a Friday evening in the near future. Newcastle’s card that night includes a Group Three race for fillies which was won by Covert Love on her way to landing the Irish Oaks a couple of years ago. The big betting race is the Gosforth Park Cup, a class two sprint handicap won last year by Line Of Reason. Cooper made a point of thanking Newcastle for being prepared to bring forward their race-times on Plate day, Saturday 30 June, so the racing can be screened on the main ITV channel before kick-off for the first World Cup knockout game that afternoon. This year’s Plate will be run at 2.05pm, 85 minutes earlier than last year. If it turns out that ITV also has the rights to that first knockout game, then the racing can hope for a good audience as the warm-up act. As it happens, today’s nap is also at Newcastle. You can get 3-1 about Weather Front (7.15), who goes well here and won over this course and distance in March, having been pipped on his previous visit. He ran respectably on turf last time, when the mile and a half might have been a bit far, and can be winning again back on the Tapeta. He comes from the bang-in-form Karen McLintock yard that has had five winners since the start of May from 17 runners.The rest of today’s action is over jumps. As Fergal O’Brien has noted on Twitter, three jumps cards in one day is better than we managed for most of the winter...At Bangor, there appears plenty of interest in Twojayslad (4.00), down to 9-2 from an opening 7-1. From the excellent Ian Williams yard, which has been winning under both codes lately, this one has come down 10lb for just four runs over the past year and now gets all the aids, a first-time tongue tie and the return of cheekpieces which were also on for the best of his runs in the past 18 months.

When Elizabeth Newman had the idea to stage the old Cliff Richard movie, with its theme of buses and travel, it seemed like a good-natured way of telling her audiences the Octagon is closed for refurbishment and on the road. Maybe she could even stage it on a bus.How fortuitous, then, that the bright and airy Bolton Interchange, bringing rail and bus stations together, had not long opened and was ripe for theatrical intervention. Fortuitous, too, that local operator Vision buses would be keen to lend her half-a-dozen vehicles. And why wouldn’t they? It’s a great, public-spirited idea.Add to this the opening-night weather making us feel as if we are on a real summer holiday (even if the line about the English rain is turned on its head) and you get the sense of a show that was meant to be. Yes, it’s daft, yes, it’s throwaway, but when the actors grab coffee cups from the Greggs across the concourse or – spectacularly – do a song-and-dance routine on the steps of the town hall, where we’ve stopped to rescue a real-life Mini, you can’t imagine a happier place to be.The good fortune continued when Newman realised the Octagon wouldn’t quite have to shut up shop. After sending us on a quick ride around the block, she and co-director Ben Occhipinti would be able to stage the bulk of Summer Holiday in the regular auditorium. By the time we get there, spirits are high and actors and audiences are as one (the Cliff singalong on the top deck has seen to that). The cast turn out to be talented actor-musicians, marking time with Shadows-style instrumentals as each bus-load arrives and rattling through early-60s rock’n’roll-lite with breezy good cheer.Inclusive, friendly, unpretentious, it’s a production of tremendous generosity. In truth, Newman has made her own luck, getting everyone from council officials to local businesses on side and willing it to work. The stage adaptation by Michael Gyngell and Mark Haddigan, first seen in Blackpool in 1996, streamlines the plot, adds a few gags and works in a couple more Cliff hits. It’s the story of a gang of mechanics who renovate a double-decker and drive it to Europe, picking up a stranded musical trio and a stowaway as they go. Holiday romance ensues. This version takes steps away from the movie’s questionable sexual politics (Cliff and his workmates all but dragging the women on board) by casting Robert Jackson as one of the previously all-female singing group. Now when their car breaks down, there’s no lady-driver cliches and when everyone falls in love, the romance is not exclusively heterosexual. Best of all, nobody comments on it.As for the central love story, Michael Peavoy has the kind of tall, dark and handsome looks as Don – plus hints of a troubled background – that justifies Eleanor Brown’s attraction to him as Barbara. For her part, she makes light work of the boy-in-disguise conceit and proves herself an independently minded woman even as she’s dancing with abandon. There are musicals with more consistent soundtracks, but their half-speed rendition of The Young Ones is gorgeous.All this plus Amanda Stoodley’s playful set design of primary coloured national flags and passing scenery makes it the feelgood hit of the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea48ff6dbc5e83bbcb7ddc4855c198c78bdd1042/0_268_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9ec07148dfe6cf2846c3069c8b473ae","title":"paul manafort tampering with witnesses say mueller investigators","story":"Prosecutors working on Trump-Russia inquiry claim former campaign manager violated bail terms Federal investigators have accused Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, of tampering with potential witnesses while on bail ahead of his federal bank fraud and tax case.Prosecutors asked that the judge overseeing his case “revoke or revise” the order releasing him ahead of trial.In a court filing on Monday, prosecutors working for the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, said Manafort and an associate “repeatedly” attempted to contact witnesses using his phone and an encrypted messaging application. They allege it happened shortly after a grand jury returned a new indictment against him, violating the terms of his house arrest. Mueller has indicted Manafort in federal courts in Washington and Virginia. He was released to home confinement after his arraignment in October. Manafort faces felony charges in the two cases over allegations he concealed tens of millions of dollars from the Internal Revenue Service that he had earned advising pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine. He is also accused of conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent when he lobbied for the pro-Russia Ukrainian government. The events took place before Trump ran for president.Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.FBI agent Brock Domin wrote in court documents that Manafort “contacted and attempted to contact” two unnamed witnesses, “in an effort to influence their testimony and to otherwise conceal evidence”. He added: “The investigation into this matter is ongoing.” The witnesses, according to the court filings, worked with Manafort in organizing the Hapsburg Group, described by the counsel’s office as “a group of former senior European politicians to take positions favorable to Ukraine, including by lobbying in the United States”.One of the potential witnesses told the government that he believed Manafort’s outreach was an effort to “suborn perjury”, a criminal offense to induce a witness to lie under oath. Manafort attempted to contact one of the witnesses in February after a federal grand jury in Washington returned a “superseding indictment”, which accused him of having “secretly retained” a group of European officials to lobby for positions favorable to Ukraine in the US. According to the court filing, Manafort called and messaged one of the witnesses on 24 February, the day after his longtime associate and a former Trump campaign official entered guilty pleas to conspiracy and lying to the FBI. During one call the witness told the government that Manafort identified himself and said he wanted to give “a heads-up about Hapsburg”. The witness said he hung up because he was “concerned” about the call, according to the affidavit. Manafort continued to try to contact him with an encrypted messaging application. Through the app, Manafort sent a link to Business Insider story titled “Former European leaders struggle to explain themselves after Mueller claims Paul Manafort paid them to lobby for Ukraine”. Then he wrote: “We should talk. I have made clear that they worked in Europe.”The filing says: “The government confirmed that these messages were sent by Manafort, upon review of Manafort’s iCloud account pursuant to a court-authorized search.”Trump has repeatedly denied collusion with Russia and on Monday called Mueller’s investigation a “phony Russian witch hunt”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6aee6007204e922c26231b38ce5bfe7f9d0a709/0_115_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6611c12be8218bf6300648d1328e9280","title":"brazil truckers roads president temer economy","story":"Brazilians were spooked by the 10-day protests – and the mistrust of the country’s political class has led to increasing polarisationA nationwide trucking strike over fuel prices in Brazil finally came to an end last week after 10 days of chaos in which roads were blockaded, South America’s biggest economy suffocated, and the CEO of Brazil’s state-controlled oil company was forced to resign.Supplies are back in the shops, and trucks back on the roads. And yet, things are far from normal.Brazilians were spooked by the ease with which the truckers brought the country to its knees, and by their calls for “military intervention” – a euphemism for a military coup.“This strike showed that the country has extreme fragilities,” wrote economic commentator Miriam Leitão in her blog for O Globo newspaper.But instead of looking for ways to prevent it happening again, Brazilians are digging into entrenched positions.There has been little debate over why the country is so dependent on road transport. Instead, Brazilians argue over when and how state-controlled oil company Petrobras should set fuel prices – the cause of the strike – and whether it should make money for its shareholders or swallow losses for the benefit of the nation.Brazilians can’t even agree on what the dictatorship was. Many “interventionists” mistakenly believe there was no corruption under the military.And others point out that hundreds of regime opponents were executed and thousands more viciously tortured under the repressive regime that ran the country for two decades until 1985.The cash-strapped conservative government of Michel Temer found the money by cutting investment elsewhere, including for health and education – a move likely to increase social tension in a country where poverty is on the rise.“We have watched a flirtation with collective suicide,” wrote rightwing commentator Reinaldo Azevedo, who compared Brazilians heading to the polls in October’s congressional and presidential elections to lemmings heading for a clifftop.Leftist commentators are equally alarmed. “It is a dangerous moment,” said Laura Carvalho, a professor of economy at the University of São Paulo. “This is related to the economic crisis, the political crisis, the corruption scandals.”The 2016 impeachment of Workers’ party president Dilma Rousseff – who was removed for breaking budget rules amid widespread anger over an enormous corruption scheme – was seen by some as a justified action against a corrupt government.And since then, Temer and his ministers have been embroiled in even more spectacular scandals.“This foments this idea that a military regime could in a way alter, transform this system,” Carvalho said. “It is a response of total disbelief.”The only politician likely to benefit from all of this is Jair Bolsonaro, an extreme rightwing lawmaker who has praised the military regime but has not faced serious graft allegations – and who flip-flopped on his support for the strike.That Petrobras is central to Brazil’s latest nightmare is no surprise.The corruption scandal that eventually felled Rousseff began with allegations that her political allies had received kickbacks from inflated contracts the company signed with contractors.The allegations quickly spread to engulf the country’s political class, but also hit Petrobras, which was unable to complete two new refineries that would have allowed Brazil to produce more gasoline and diesel.Rousseff’s administration forced Petrobras to sell gasoline and diesel below international prices to keep inflation down, costing it billions of dollars in revenue. Under Temer, the company swung in the opposite direction and started raising prices daily as the international cost of oil soared.On Friday, the company’s CEO, Pedro Parente, resigned, in a move that was celebrated by labour unions but lamented by financial markets. Petrobras shares tanked.Industry experts said the company should have showed more “sensitivity” in its price rises.But sensitivity has been drowned out in an atmosphere of increasing polarisation.Left and right hurl insults at each other over social media like rival supporters at a soccer game. Meanwhile, economists are slashing their growth forecasts for an economy only just limping out of recession.“The strike and calls for military intervention are a wake-up call,” said Ilona Szabó, co-founder of Agora! (Now!), a new centrist group propagating “evidence-based public policies”. Szabo argued that too many people are looking for simplistic solutions to complex problems.“Brazilians are crying for change but it’s not yet clear that they are prepared to put the public interest in front of private gain. Instead of rolling up their sleeves and building a common project they are clamouring for a saviour, a strongman, who can deliver the country from ruin,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bd33b75b5b044a77fd2a0c97662b954597e0edf/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249b63eb414c2787da9bdca2e44bc227","title":"ontario election doug ford andrea horwath","story":"Canada’s largest province is clamoring for change – and two parties with opposing visions are neck-and-neckDays before residents in Canada’s largest province head to the polls, Kathleen Wynne, Ontario’s current leader, conceded that she had little chance of holding on to her job.“I don’t know who voters will choose that’s up to them,” the premier said during a recent campaign stop in Toronto. “But I’m pretty sure it won’t be me.”At the outset of the campaign it seemed Ontario’s Conservatives – led by Doug Ford, the brother of late Toronto mayor Rob Ford – would easily capitalise on this sentiment to secure a majority. But recent weeks have seen the left-of-centre New Democratic party (NDP) surge in popularity, offering a progressive alternative to Ford, whose leadership has elicited comparisons to Donald Trump.Polls suggest the two parties – both of whom are pitching radical change – are now neck-and-neck, pitting the rightwing populist politics that have swept much of the world against promises to increase government spending and raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy. “People believe we can do much better than what we’re doing and I think that’s what’s creating a sense of energy around our campaign,” the provincial party leader Andrea Horwath told the  in an interview. “They’re actually hopeful that we can do things differently.”Her party is promising to drastically expand universal healthcare to include dental care and pharmacare, tackle childcare costs that rank among the highest in the OECD and offer free university and college tuition for students in need. “Families are telling me they’re terrified of what lies ahead,” said Horwath, citing stories of crippling student debt and the explosion of part time, casual and contract work. “As the economy continues to be challenging one – and one in flux – governments need to step up to the plate and make sure people have the basics like prescription drugs or dental care.” In contrast, Ford has railed against taxes and big government. Along with lowering taxes, his party promises to reduce the price of gasoline, boost spending on healthcare and transit and repeal carbon pricing. Voters are frustrated, he told supporters as he touted a platform that would deliver “real change” earlier this week. “Everybody’s stuck their hand in their pocket.” The wide ideological gulf between Horwath and Ford – a businessman who peppers interviews and speeches with boasts and falsehoods and takes aim at the elites – has transformed the character of the election, said Frank Graves of EKOS Research Associates. “This was sort of an acid test of whether or not the ordered rightwing populism that had produced Brexit and Trump and others was going to occur in Canada,” he said.But in recent weeks, the Conservatives’ commanding lead has eroded as Ford refused to detail how his promises would be funded – instead referring vaguely to finding “efficiencies” across the government – and calculations that suggest his tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest in the province.The result is the kind of election that might have transpired south of the border if Bernie Sanders had been able to take on Trump for the American presidency a battle between the isive wedge politics that have rattled countries around the world and an approach rooted in a more open society and a redistribution of wealth. “It seems, in this case, Canada is opting for the more open approach,” said Graves, pointing to recent polling done by his firm that put the NDP slightly ahead of the Conservatives.The coming days will likely be crucial. All of the major parties have stumbled as they race towards the finish line Horwath has been forced on the offensive after it emerged that one candidate had described wearing poppies on Remembrance Day as a “ritual of war glorification” and another – Gurratan Singh, the brother of federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh – had wielded a “Fuck the Police” placard at a 2006 rally.The Conservatives have been accused of trying to sell bogus party memberships and using paid actors, while Ford has fended off questions about candidates who disparaged Muslims online and used stolen data to advance the party’s cause.On Monday it was revealed that the widow and children of Rob Ford had filed a lawsuit in a Toronto court, accusing Doug of being a “negligent” business manager whose decisions had steadily chipped away at the multi-million dollar company the Ford brothers inherited from their father, Deco Labels. The C$16.5m lawsuit alleges that Doug has deprived his late brother’s family of millions of dollars, according to the Toronto Star. Ford has denied all of the allegations, which have not been proven in court.The many parallels between Trump and Ford mean the tumultuous politics playing out south of the border could also play a role in determining the election outcome, said Geneviève Tellier of the University of Ottawa.“Doug Ford is not Trump, but he’s borrowing some ideas, such as not speaking to the media, for instance, or not considering expert reports,” she said. “We have seen what is going on in the US and I don’t think that many Ontarians want to see this kind of politics happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0040cbca7fa6965aac9a1b4e5f34dfd58594e2e3/235_187_1653_992/master/1653.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=307807d35fd47a34086696e38315eb83","title":"saudi arabia issues first drivers licences to women","story":"Kingdom prepares to lift ban on female drivers but crackdown on activists continuesSaudi Arabia has issued its first driving licences to 10 women, as the kingdom prepares to lift the world’s only ban on female drivers in three weeks’ time.However, some people who campaigned for the right to drive remain under arrest.  A government statement said the 10 women given licences already held driving licences from other countries, including the US, UK, Lebanon and Canada. They took a brief driving exam and eye test before being issued with the licences at the traffic department in the capital, Riyadh.  Other women across the country have been preparing for the right to drive on 24 June by taking driving courses on female-only college campuses. Some are even training to become drivers for ride-hailing companies such as Uber.  Saudi women had long complained of having to hire costly male drivers, use taxis or rely on male relatives to get to work or run errands.  Several activists who campaigned for the right to drive remain under arrest, facing possible trial. Saudi Arabia’s prosecutor said on Sunday that 17 people had been detained in recent weeks on suspicion of trying to undermine security and stability, a case activists said targeted prominent women’s rights campaigners. The prosecutor’s statement said eight people have been temporarily released, while five men and four women remained under arrest. Among the women held since 15 May are Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Nafjan, sources told the Associated Press.  The three are among the most outspoken and well-known women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia. They have not only risked arrest by pushing for years for the right to drive, but have also called for an end to ship laws that give male relatives the final say over a woman marrying or traveling abroad.  Their activism was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom. They face a range of charges including communicating with people and organisations hostile to the kingdom and providing financial and moral support to hostile elements abroad. State-linked media have referred to the group as “foreign embassy agents” and branded them traitors.  Three other veteran women’s rights activists, who had taken part in the first protest in 1990 against the kingdom’s ban on women driving, were also briefly detained.  Nearly 50 women took part in that first driving protest 28 years ago. The women were arrested, lost their jobs and had their passports confiscated for a year.  Others were detained over the years during various efforts by women’s rights activists to drive. While Saudi law has never explicitly banned women from driving, women were not issued with driving licences. Often, police would detain a female driver until a male relative could pick her up and sign a pledge on her behalf that she would not drive again.  Ultra-conservatives viewed women driving as immoral and warned they would be subject to sexual harassment if they drove. Four years ago the country’s top cleric, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz Al Sheikh, said barring women from driving “was in the best interest of society” because it protected them from having to deal with an accident.  The kingdom faces steep economic challenges and has a burgeoning young population that has access to the world through the internet and sees women in neighbouring Muslim countries driving freely.  In an attempt to boost the economy and ease international criticism, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been promoting changes, such as the decision to allow women to drive, while risking a backlash from clerics and others who adhere to the ultraconservative Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.  The prince has also attempted to appeal to young Saudis by opening the country to more entertainment, allowing music concerts and bringing the first commercial movie theatre to Saudi Arabia this year.  However, rights groups say the arrest of activists by the crown prince’s security forces are an attempt to silence dissent as women prepare to drive for the first time, and may be a way to freeze any calls for greater reforms. Liz Throssell, a spokeswoman for the UN high commissioner for human rights, has described the crackdown as “perplexing”.  “If, as it appears, their detention is related solely to their work as human rights defenders and activists on women’s issues, they should be released immediately,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2c1bf8bc510f7a89767644609c6c5abf716111/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c255d3a7c592e951c4ff98e384a218","title":"guatemalas fuego volcano erupts in pictures","story":"At least 25 people have been killed and nearly 300 injured in the most violent eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano in more than 40 years, officials said.

He has no retirement fund in place and would use the Lifetime Isa to save for the long-term futureUnfortunately, the nature of being self-employed means there’s no regularity in how often I’m paid. Projects can be sporadic and uncertain. Invoices can be delayed, projects can drag on or I can just not win work for a while. If I don’t work, I don’t make money. It’s a scary and risky career but it’s very rewarding at times.I pay myself a set salary that helps me limit how much I spend each month, and keeps the money I shouldn’t spend in my business. I also put some of this salary into my savings. Anything extra I earn at the end of the year usually goes into my savings too. It’s definitely stressful though. I sometimes worry if I’ll carry on making enough money as each year passes, but if I can stay organised with my business and earnings, I can relax a lot more.As well as having an unreliable income, it’s also challenging having to calculate how much I’ll spend in expenses for my business and how much tax I’ll owe each year. There are days I wish I was employed again, so I could rely on a steady stream of income and know how much I can actually put into my savings each month. However, the upside of being freelance is that I can earn a higher amount each month than I normally would when working for a company, which makes the opportunity to save far greater.The main attraction of a Lifetime Isa for me is the prospect of having a retirement fund for when I’m older. Being self-employed, I don’t currently have a pension and it’s scary knowing I have nothing to fall back on. I’m hitting 30 this year and having a Lifetime Isa or a pension is a must for me now. I’m always one to want to find the best option possible and other Isas currently on the market don’t feel worthwhile any more.There’s nothing worse than constantly saving and never enjoying your money. My wife and I are hooked on travel and like to see as much of the world as possible. Aside from wanting to build a financial safety net for the future, our main saving goal is to have enough to enjoy ourselves along the way.Laura Lucas, 29, is a marketing assistant in Manchester and a lifestyle blogger in her spare time. She is considering a Lifetime Isa to save for her first houseI blog most evenings, which doesn’t provide much income, but I hope it’ll be my main job one day. Blogging is good in that I can save money that I might have otherwise spent on dinner out or a new outfit, because I’m lucky enough to get gifted these sorts of things. I feel like I’m currently working two jobs, one that I love but which doesn’t pay, and my main job that I rely on for income. My partner and I got engaged over Christmas, so we’re saving for a wedding in about two years’ time, as well as starting to think about buying our first home together. We’ll probably do the wedding on a budget with some special bits and bobs thrown in, but we’ll have to plan ahead to make sure we can afford the extravagant extras. I’d also love to have an engagement party in the next few months and it’s my partner’s 30th birthday this year, so even though we want to celebrate these occasions in style we might have to dial them down a little to save money. We both work really hard, so we don’t want to cut out anything like holidays or evening drinks with friends. I like to think I’m a good saver, and a Lifetime Isa would help us to save for our first house. It’s great to have something backed by the government to help young people save. It’s challenging these days but a Lifetime Isa encourages you to think long term about home ownership and retirement. I already have a couple of savings accounts that I sometimes dip into for Christmas and birthdays, holidays and more expensive purchases, but setting these accounts up can be stressful. It takes a lot of research and background work to fully understand what you’re getting when you sign up.At the moment, I’m not quite sure where I want to be money-wise. I’m grateful for my living situation and being able to live comfortably. However, there are many more things we’d love to do, like decorating our apartment and travelling more, but with our wedding and buying a house on the horizon, we’re trying to be a bit more sensible and only invest small amounts at a time in things we know we need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5aa7c8a80034b712f3fe779d128833acb137a7/0_516_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a0256549ad0f979f025f93b1e6c682","title":"how to buy your first house","story":"Many of us aim to own our own home. But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3961ff6bd45223a626b86d067c99a9fadb159cb3/0_137_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5faf953013180a1480cefeec5f7824d9","title":"eight financial apps to transform how you deal with money","story":"It’s time to upgrade your piggy bank.

But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Talks are scheduled between the British and EU sides every day this week.The Government wants to see significant progress at the technical talks this week in an effort to break the stalemate between the EU and UK over the future of the Border, and high-ranking sources confirmed that they expected to see proposals from the British this week.Dublin is pressing the British to provide more detailed alternative solutions and proposals on a legally-operable text on the default “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union should no other plan be agreed to maintain an invisible border. The timetable for the EU-UK talks in Brussels lists a session on Wednesday on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sources in Brussels say that it is expected to be a short meeting, dealing with a number of technical issues, although if the UK brings new proposals they will be discussed.Three more days of talks follow this week on the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this month.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit negotiator, has warned of a difficult summer of negotiations if no progress is made by this summit, pushing negotiations to the October deadline set to allow the UK and EU parliaments time to approve any final withdrawal deal by the UK’s departure next March. “Our position remains that significantly more progress is needed ahead of the June European Council, ” said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.“Michel Barnier has made this very clear, including during his recent visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland. At this stage in the process the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.”Concerns about the lack of progress in negotiations were voiced by Germany’s top Brexit diplomat Peter Ptassek, who played down expectations about agreement being reached by the council on June 28th-29th. Irish officials viewed Mr Ptassek’s remarks as another attempt to increase the pressure on the British to propose solutions in what is viewed as a make-or-break fortnight to prepare for the June summit as UK media reports suggest the British is preparing “Doomsday” contingency plans for no deal. An influential London think tank has said in a new report that British prime minister Theresa May should propose her own version of the backstop for the Border before the summit.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own,” says the Institute for Government report.“It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments and is politically acceptable.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519429.1528143934!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald seeks coalition deal with fg or ff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald said that she expected to talk to both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about forming a government.

She made a strong pitch to the so-called “squeezed middle”, stressing the priorities of public services and the cost of living, as she seeks to broaden Sinn Féin’s appeal from its working class base.She said that a programme for government drawn up by Sinn Féin and one of the big two parties would be a document that “will be ambitious, that will be different and that looks at the red line issues around the health system, people’s standard of living, people’s capacity to have just some disposable income at the end of the week or the end of the month”.Ms McDonald stressed the interests of “people who are at work but are still struggling, people who pay their taxes, do everything by the book and still constantly have their hand in the pocket for everything and who scratch their heads and wonder ‘what am I paying those taxes for?’“People who look at the system and say, it doesn’t work, or it doesn’t work for me, it’s not accountable.”The Sinn Féin leader is seeking to modify her party’s stance in advance of an election to try to keep it prominent in the final stages of a campaign when the attention of many voters turns to the formation of the next government.However, the Sinn Féin leader will have to convince either or both big parties to overcome their stated opposition to doing a deal with her. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has trenchantly ruled out any deal with Sinn Féin, while Fine Gael has also said it will not form an administration with the party. As recently as last weekend, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan categorically ruled out any coalition, citing the party’s economic policies and its association with the IRA, saying “a leopard doesn’t change its spots”.On Brexit, Ms McDonald backed the stated intention of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to demand substantial progress on the Irish border by the time of the June EU summit.“If we are still in a state of drift, the responsible and proportionate thing to do is to hit not the stop button, but the pause button,” she said.“We’ve said this publicly and privately to the Taoiseach. It would be dangerous to leave these things bleed into the summer and the autumn. We need to bring it to a head in June, not the autumn. The Taoiseach needs to do that now.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.  Video: Kathleen Harris Enda O\u0027Dowd \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA single rose is held aloft at Dublin Castle as the crowd gathered to celebrate the Yes vote. Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneMary Lou McDonald is on a bit of a roll.The Sinn Féin leader was centre stage for the final phase of the abortion referendum. She’s riding high in opinion polls. The New York Times gushed last week that she was “being whispered about as the possible first female prime minister of Ireland”. And today she is serving notice that she is ready and willing to enter government.It’s McDonald’s current mission to overcome that antipathy, or manoeuvre the old rivals into a position where they feel compelled to swallow it.She can fairly point to the recent history of Irish politics, which is a procession of people doing deals they said they never would. But while the post-election numbers may mean a coalition government involving Sinn Féin is an obvious option, the example of the present Government suggests that it won’t be the only one.The process of putting together a government after the next election will be convoluted, but it’s one that McDonald is determined to elbow her way into.McDonald is luxuriating in the approval of repeal supporters since her prominent role in the abortion referendum campaign. She was especially visible in the final weeks, appearing in two television debates and performing capably in both. She describes the campaign as “actual new politics . . . because it was politics beyond politicians”.There is a bit of unfinished business for Sinn Féin, though the Government’s proposed legislation goes well beyond Sinn Féin party policy, which McDonald will now seek to change to a pro-choice position that will accord with the forthcoming abortion Bill.Debate in the party, she says, “is under way at regional level and local level”.“We had some discussion around this. How do you fairly and democratically shape party positions on this issue?”The way Sinn Féin usually does that is that the leadership decides where it wants to get to and then consults extensively with the grassroots, who then approve the position. A special ardfheis in Belfast later this month is likely to endorse the leadership position. But clearly not everyone will agree.Two Sinn Féin TDs, Peadar Tóibín and Carol Nolan, campaigned strongly for a No vote in the referendum. It looks like she will have to throw them out.“I’ve allowed lots of latitude for conscience, McDonald says, “the absolute right for people to hold their view, to articulate their view, to have their view respected . . . Where the line is drawn is where it comes to making the law and forming public policy. And in those circumstances when a Sinn Féin representative walks into an elected chamber, there is a duty on that person whoever they are to vote in accordance with Sinn Féin policy.”But they were elected by the voters, not by Sinn Féin – and they were elected on a party policy that she now proposes to change, and then to punish them when they don’t conform to the new policy.“Everyone who runs for Sinn Féin has to be a Sinn Féin member in good standing. They’re fully au fait with how the party works. All of us know how policy is arrived at . . . That’s how we do our business.”And those who in conscience cannot abide by your new position – you will show them the door?“No, I won’t. The party rules will be applied.”McDonald herself has held a pro-choice position for a long time, she says. So what about when the party’s position was not pro-choice? Did she argue and vote for anti-abortion positions then?Transcripts of Dáil debates on abortion in recent years show McDonald apparently struggling with her responsibility to hold the party line. When Clare Daly proposed a constitutional amendment in 2014, McDonald made a somewhat strangulated speech: “I am advised,” McDonald said, “that Deputy Daly’s well-intentioned proposal goes beyond the democratic mandate afforded me by virtue of my party’s long-standing compromise position, clearly stated and well-known to the electorate. I am, therefore, unable to support this legislation.”She says now: “Let me tell you, I have found myself in positions and at times prior to being leader as an activist where the party’s position didn’t accord with my personal view.”The priority of party discipline and loyalty is something frequently cited by the party’s opponents as evidence of the cultural chasm that separates it from the political mainstream.And while it might make them easy coalition partners, the party has struggled with accommodating dissent. There has been an exodus of prominent members and councillors in recent years, amid allegations of a culture of bullying and intimidation. McDonald pledged to address the issue when she became leader.“Yes, it is an issue,” she says. “I don’t believe there is a culture of bullying. But I do know that we have a changed party, a much bigger party. The way we manage the party has been suited to a smaller party. That doesn’t work now.”She says that the party is “putting the finishing touches to a commission – a commission on ersity, equality and inclusion. It will facilitate conversation across the party about the party. That will be helpful.”Is it an admission of a widespread problem?“It’s an admission that it’s a human organisation . . . It’s wrong but it happens. Rivalry between people can become a thing locally. There were incidents. That’s not unique to Sinn Féin.“You can’t say that it’ll never happen in any organisation,” McDonald says. “The members took it to heart. People took the gravest offence at the suggestion of a culture of bullying.”The question for the outside world, though, is not whether Sinn Féin members have been offended – it’s about the nature of the culture within the party, and what that says about it, and how it would use power if it came to hold it. And the party clearly has questions to answer about it.If there isn’t a culture of bullying, there is certainly a culture of obedience to authority in the party, a prioritisation of the party’s interests, and many of those who fall foul of it have been ostracised. As it prepares – it says – for government, those are questions that are unlikely to go away.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"the lemass","story":"Stonewalling ended when Harold Wilson took power in 1964 and revealed location of bodyRoyal was eager to attend but prospect of official visits exercised former taoiseach"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519215.1528128871!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may must devise version of brexit backstop option says think tank","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prime minister Theresa May: she needs to table something on Brexit border that could work, meets commitments, and is politically acceptable. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesTheresa May should propose her own version of the Brexit backstop option for the Border ahead of this month’s EU summit in Brussels, according to an influential London think-tank.The Institute for Government’s report The Irish Border after Brexit says that while the UK has begun to propose future arrangements on issues like customs that could help avoid a hard border, they are not fully fleshed out and are unacceptable to the EU.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own. It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments, and is politically acceptable,” the report says.British officials have floated the possibility of a backstop that would apply to the whole of the UK, keeping it aligned with the EU on customs and regulations for goods. EU negotiators insist, however, that the proposed backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.“If it sticks to that line, the UK and the EU will need to explore the promised ‘innovative solutions’ either for the North – or the whole island of Ireland – that are both compatible with the joint report and do not upset the delicate unionist-nationalist balance of the Good FridayBelfast Agreement.“The UK could, for example, try reducing coverage to key sectors for cross-Border trade and try negotiating equivalence in specific areas – whereby the EU would accept that the UK was meeting the same outcomes but by different means. It could also propose that the backstop was overseen by whatever governance process is agreed for the Withdrawal Agreement rather than the EU institutions as now. The aim would be to remove the implication that Northern Ireland was separated from the rest of the UK and had become part of the EU’s customs territory and regulatory jurisdiction,” the report says.With EU officials warning that little progress has been made ahead of this month’s summit, government whips told Conservative MPs on Monday that the House of Commons would vote next week on amendments passed in the House of Lords to the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Top EU court rules same-sex spouses have same rights in countries that have not legalised gay marriage Lawyers for former Malaysian prime minister quit during corruption probe\u0026#39No win no fee\u0026#39 claims firms face hidden fees crackdown Love Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestantsFather of Irish Olympic champion Katie Taylor shot at boxing clubPutin denies trying to ide Europe ahead of visit to Austria where he is accused of funding far-RightGardeners\u0026#39 home remedies for beating slugs and snails to be scientifically tested for the first time by RHSTwenty-seven minutes and Grenfell Tower fire had taken hold: so why weren\u0026#39t residents told to get out?Michael McIntyre robbed by muggers on a moped during school runAlmost 50 court cases dropped in six weeks because of issues with disclosure, CPS revealsFootage shows how quickly the Grenfell Tower fire took hold Iran tells UN of plan to enrich uranium in response to US withdrawal from nuclear dealComment: With \u0026#39One Plastic Free Day\u0026#39 we can inspire people worldwide to fight for a sustainable futureSpecial prosecutor accuses Paul Manafort of tampering with witnesses in Trump Russia probeManhunt underway after woman and baby stabbed in west LondonNicholas Parsons misses first Just a Minute show in over 50 yearsHeathrow expansion to become official policy -

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyTop EU court rules same-sex spouses have same rights in countries that have not legalised gay marriage Lawyers for former Malaysian prime minister quit during corruption probe\u0026#39No win no fee\u0026#39 claims firms face hidden fees crackdown Love Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestantsFather of Irish Olympic champion Katie Taylor shot at boxing clubPutin denies trying to ide Europe ahead of visit to Austria where he is accused of funding far-RightGardeners\u0026#39 home remedies for beating slugs and snails to be scientifically tested for the first time by RHSTwenty-seven minutes and Grenfell Tower fire had taken hold: so why weren\u0026#39t residents told to get out?Michael McIntyre robbed by muggers on a moped during school runAlmost 50 court cases dropped in six weeks because of issues with disclosure, CPS revealsFootage shows how quickly the Grenfell Tower fire took hold Iran tells UN of plan to enrich uranium in response to US withdrawal from nuclear dealComment: With \u0026#39One Plastic Free Day\u0026#39 we can inspire people worldwide to fight for a sustainable futureSpecial prosecutor accuses Paul Manafort of tampering with witnesses in Trump Russia probeManhunt underway after woman and baby stabbed in west LondonNicholas Parsons misses first Just a Minute show in over 50 yearsHeathrow expansion to become official policy - but government faces battle in ParliamentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000021422856_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqlnoKbsnqupgsmdP1L78oDRvAwTeWo9LfMKkzKcKsUQo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"just minute host misses first show 50 years","story":"The 94-year-old broadcasting veteran was just enjoying a rare day off, the BBC\u0026#39s head of comedy saidNicholas Parsons missed Just A Minute for first time in more than 50 years as Gyles Brandreth stepped in for a ‘very unexpected’ episode. The presenter, 94, has been on the BBC Radio 4 programme since its inception in 1967 but was absent from last night\u0027s installment.Gyles Brandreth filled in for him, prompting an outpouring of worried messages from fans on social media.The BBC\u0027s head of radio comedy, Julia McKenzie, was quick to assure listeners that Parsons was just enjoying a rare day off.She tweeted: Just to reassure those listening to the very unexpected Just a Minute on @BBCRadio4 at the moment - the apocalypse is not upon us - @GylesB1 kindly stepped in to give Nicholas Parsons a couple of days off.NP is totally fine and is still the guvnor as per the last 50 years.After the show  Brandreth tweeted that Parsons had called him to inform him that he was “too good”.

The IATA expects airlines to report a collective net profit of $33.8bn in 2018, and said this would be a “a solid performance despite rising costs, primarily fuel and labor, but also the upturn in the interest rate cycle”. The US central bank raised interest rates in March, and the Bank of England is widely expected to hike rates in the coming months.In addition, oil prices have been climbing in recent weeks, and in May broke past the $80 per barrel mark for the first time in three and a half years after President Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal. The IATA said it expects the full-year average cost of Brent crude oil to be $70 per barrel, up 27.5 per cent from the average of $59.40 per barrel in 2017, while jet fuel prices are set to rise 25.9 per cent to $84 per barrel. The forecast net profit for this year has been revised down from a previous estimate of $38.4bn, and the IATA’s expected 2018 profit would also come in well below the record $38bn reported by airlines last year.The group also said operating profits, “though still high by past standards, have been trending slowly downwards since early 2016, as a result of accelerating costs”.Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO, said: “Solid profitability is holding up in 2018, despite rising costs. The industry’s financial foundations are strong with a nine-year run in the black that began in 2010. And the return on invested capital will exceed the cost of capital for a fourth consecutive year. “At long last, normal profits are becoming normal for airlines. This enables airlines to fund growth, expand employment, strengthen balance sheets and reward our investors.”Meanwhile, growing uncertainty about global affairs “could present risks to the industry’s outlook”, according to the IATA. The group said particular risks included the advancement of political forces pushing a protectionist agenda, uncertainty following the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and a lack of clarity on the impact of Brexit.“Aviation spreads prosperity and enriches the human spirit. That truth lays the foundation for a very important message. The world is better off when borders are open to people and to trade. And our hard work as an industry has primed aviation to be an even stronger catalyst for an ever more inclusive globalization,” said Mr de Juniac.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is why it\u0027s worth indulging in one of those exercises considering what else you could do with the money.\u0026nbspWithout further ado, £2.1bn is the amount Harrods’ well heeled shoppers spent throughout the course of the year to January 28 2017. It would buy you just over ten Gareth Bales, based on Real Madrid’s reported asking price for the Welsh wunderkind. It would pay for the reconstruction of London’s\u0026nbspBarts\u0026nbspHospital twice over. It would cover the £200m\u0026nbspestimated budget of Han Solo: A Star Wars Story ten times over. It would pay the annual salaries of nearly 92,000 newly qualified teachers or nurses or\u0026nbspmore than 27,000 newly appointed\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspconsultants.\u0026nbspIn corporate terms, it was the purchase price for WS Atkins, a British multinational engineering, project management and design outfit, when it was gobbled up by Canadian outfit\u0026nbspSNC-Lavalin\u0026nbsplast summer. At the time the company employed 18,000 people in 300 offices in 29 countries.\u0026nbspIn other words, £2.1bn is an absurd amount of money to pour down the toilet. And yet there has been with remarkably little debate about doing so via the RBS\u0026nbspsell off.\u0026nbspSensing that people might be\u0026nbspa little upset, the government dispatched only a junior minister, John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, to defend the action on the BBC’s Today programme. He told listeners that we “need to be realistic” and “look at market conditions”.\u0026nbspThe problem with that line? A realistic look at market conditions would tell you that now is a rotten time to be selling bank shares, what with the turmoil that Italy is causing in the Eurozone, not to mention the damage Mr Glen’s Government is doing to every man jack of us with its Brexit policy. \u0026nbspBut, but, but, say the defenders, it will take years for\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspshares to break through the\u0026nbsp500p\u0026nbspbarrier and at which point the state makes a profit. We need to get going now. Private investors don’t like state backed institutions.\u0026nbspThis will show them that there is no intention for RBS\u0026nbspto remain that wauy and\u0026nbspwill whet their appetites for more sales down the line.\u0026nbspI\u0027m not sure what that says about Saudi\u0026nbspAramco, the oil company backed by the state of Saudi Arabia. You may have noticed that the\u0026nbspworld’s financial centres, including London, have been falling\u0026nbspover each other in an attempt to land the flotation of that entity\u0026nbspbecause and his uncle wants a piece of the investment action.\u0026nbspThe fact is, it\u0026nbspdoesn’t matter if there is a government of some description on a shareholder register, and it\u0026nbspdoesn’t matter if there is a stock overhang. It\u0026nbspdoesn’t matter if the governance of company X is awful and there is a remuneration plan in place to give a dodgy CEO ten per cent of the equity for hitting some easily achievable target, or even no target at all, because if the City scents value, investors will steam in. If\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspshares look\u0026nbspcheap, institutional investors will\u0026nbspbuy regardless.\u0026nbspThis is not an argument for the bank\u0026nbspto remain in state hands. It is simply a suggestion that the Government is proceeding undue haste now it\u0026nbsphas paid its whopping US fine for its involvement in the mortgage backed securities market in the run up to the financial crisis.It is true, as banking analyst Ian Gordon has pointed out, that\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspshares are trading at close to a two year high, and have outperformed other UK bank shares in the year to date.\u0026nbspBut that’s what you would expect to see happening with a recovery play.If, as Mr Glen has stated,\u0026nbspRBS\u0026nbspis “a completely different institution to where it was 10 years ago” then\u0026nbspthe government should\u0026nbspsit\u0026nbspback and waiting for the market to wake up to that fact because, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell has stated, there is simply no economic justification for its\u0026nbspcurrent policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Spending grew 5.1 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, the biggest rise since April 2017, Barclaycard found.In-store spending rose 2.6 per cent as pubs and DIY shops both saw sales jump by almost a fifth over the bank holiday.\u0026nbspGarden centres had the most impressive sales rise, with takings up 50 per cent on this time last year. Supermarkets’ sales were up 10 per cent over the long weekend and 5.7 per cent for May as a whole.The good news will come as welcome respite for high street chains struggling against rising business rates, increases to the minimum wage and consumers who had been tightening their belts.\u0026nbspThe rebound in May saw non-essential spending growth reach a 14-month high of 4.6 per cent, with the warm weather boosting clothing sales by 5.8 per cent, according to the research.The numbers are in stark contrast to the negative impact of the Beast from the East, which dented sales for many retailers as shoppers stayed home to avoid the snow and ice.\u0026nbspNearly a quarter of Brits surveyed said they intend to spend more on experiences this summer. Of those, 35 per cent plan to visit live events such as festivals and a fifth said they are are more likely than usual to go to a pub to watch sport.Despite the strong numbers, UK shoppers have become more pessimistic with 57 per cent saying they are confident in their household finances, down from 62 per cent in April.Esme Harwood,\u0026nbspdirector at Barclaycard, said a degree of caution among UK shoppers remained but this didn’t stop people enjoying the sunshine.“This brought good news for the high street as Brits updated their wardrobes – with growth on clothes going up by the highest amount in two years – and took to pub gardens to enjoy the blue skies,” she said.“Looking ahead, it seems the experience economy will remain a top priority as consumers plan to treat themselves to major music and sporting events. In the next few months, we expect to see families carefully balancing their budgets to ensure they don’t miss out on their must-see and must-do experiences of the summer.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Even if it\u0027s old.The company\u0026nbspannounced iOS\u0026nbsp12, the new version of its operating software for iPhone and iPads. And while it did not include some of the dramatic features found in previous updates, it did include at least two profound changes.And as well as those, it introduced a raft of fun and meaningful new changes, designed to make the iPhone more fun. They include changes to animoji\u0026nbspand new features to improve the phone\u0027s augmented reality tools.But many of the features were intended to make people spend less time on their phone. The new software includes a variety of ways to do things more quickly, and new ways to remind you to get off your phone.Here\u0027s a full rundown of all the important changes introduced in iOS\u0026nbsp12, which will be released this year.Chief among the new features was something that wasn\u0027t really a feature at all. Instead, it was a promise from Apple to focus on the performance of the new software, ensuring that the phones running it do so quickly and without bugs.In particular, Apple will focus on ensuring that old phones are able to run the software as well as they can. Apple said that iOS\u0026nbsp12 improves the performance of the iPhone 6 – for example – dramatically, even when it is doing intensive processes.This has been a repeated complaint about new versions of iOS – and, anecdotally, one that gets louder every year. This should be the first time that your phone feels much faster after updating, as well as much more exciting.(Apple software boss Craig Federighi claimed that these speed boosts and performance improvements would be a worthy upgrade all by themself.)The other major upgrade was also focused on fixing problems rather than introducing new things. Apple\u0027s Screen Time feature is intended to make your phone a happier and healthier place to be – even if that means stopping you using it.Among other things, the phone will watch how you are using your apps and assemble that into graphs and charts with a whole array of probably shocking information: how often you use certain apps, and how often you pick up your phone. If you see something in there you don\u0027t like, you can set limits – so that your phone will kick you out of Instagram if you use it for more than an hour, for instance.It will concentrate on notifications, too. Apple will make it much easier to ignore them when they\u0027re not relevant to what you are doing, in an effort to stop them being quite so intrusive and distracting you from what you should really be getting on with.Apple is taking a swipe at ubiquitous share buttons created by Facebook and others to track your\u0026nbspbehavior\u0026nbsponline regardless of whether you click on them. The company says it\u0027s shutting down that tracking through its Safari browser in an update to Mac and\u0026nbspiOS\u0026nbspdevices, including\u0026nbspiPhones\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspiPads. Apple senior vice president Craig\u0026nbspFederighi\u0026nbspsaid such tracking would be blocked by default. Even if users click to share an item, they will get a prompt with an option to prevent subsequent tracking.\u0026nbspHe also said Apple would crack down on so-called fingerprinting, in which data companies identify specific devices by creating a unique fingerprint based on a device\u0027s particular configuration settings, installed fonts and plug-ins. Apple plans to instead send out generic data to such collectors, making a user\u0027s device look just like any other Apple device.\u0026nbspFederighi\u0026nbspsaid the changes will make it dramatically more difficult for data companies to identify you and track you.\u0026nbspLast year, Apple added intelligent tracking prevention that imposes time limits on tracking cookies and takes other measures to try to prevent advertising tech companies from following users around the web.\u0026nbspApple rolled out new support for augmented reality applications as it unveiled a new format for digital objects that appear to live in the real world.\u0026nbspThe update comes as Apple tries to extend AR experiences to a broader population, rather than just hard-core, tech-savvy users. The company started that effort last year when it built AR tools into most\u0026nbspiPhones\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspiPads by contrast, Google had limited that to niche Android phone models.Digital objects created with the new format, called\u0026nbspUSDZ, will work in Apple\u0027s Safari browser, Messages and Mail apps, meaning AR isn\u0027t limited to stand-alone apps that people choose to download separately. The format will also get support in Adobe\u0027s Creative Cloud suite of apps for professional photographers, videographers and designers. What remains to be seen is whether there is enough of a compelling reason for someone to use AR, even if it\u0027s built-in to everyday apps.\u0026nbspApple also unveiled an app called Measure that measures boxes and other objects in the real world by pointing the camera at them. Apple is also offering tools to give multiple users a different view of the same digital objects viewed from different angles.In iOS 12, the company\u0027s animated emoji which track a user\u0027s face, known as Animoji, have also been updated to include new animals, as well as the ability to detect when a tongue is being stuck out.A new version of the app, called Memoji, will now also enable users to create animated emoji of their own faces instead of using an animal face.Apple\u0027s video calling tools have barely changed at all since they were introduced in 2010.Now it will include a range of changes, chief among them the ability to speak to more than one person at once. In fact, you\u0027ll be able to speak to 32 people at once.All of that is done within a redesigned interface. When people speak, for instance, FaceTime spots it and ensures that the screen showing the person talking takes up more of the screen.And you can also use the animoji\u0026nbspdescribed above within a FaceTime call. That means you can stick the cartoon version of your face over the real one.Apple wants its digital assistant Siri to do more. Third-party apps will now be able to let users invoke Siri for commonly used tasks, much the way competing assistants from Google and Amazon long have. Before, Apple had limited third-party access to a handful of categories, such as messaging, while excluding competitors to Apple\u0027s Music service, for instance.\u0026nbspThe software update will also let people group similar tasks together into shortcuts that can be accessed by simple phrases like heading home. Saying the phrase can be set to open Apple Maps to find the best route home and launching a radio app.Apple will encourage users to share photos with their friends by suggesting such opportunities in a new for you tab. When a friend receives photos from an event, Apple will then suggest that the friend reciprocate with photos from the same event. It\u0027s similar to how Google already encourages sharing through its own Photos app for both iPhones and Android devices.\u0026nbspApple says all sharing will be done privately, using encryption already built into its Messages app.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Spending grew 5.1 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, the biggest rise since April 2017, Barclaycard found.In-store spending rose 2.6 per cent as pubs and DIY shops both saw sales jump by almost a fifth over the bank holiday.\u0026nbspGarden centres had the most impressive sales rise, with takings up 50 per cent on this time last year. Supermarkets’ sales were up 10 per cent over the long weekend and 5.7 per cent for May as a whole.The good news will come as welcome respite for high street chains struggling against rising business rates, increases to the minimum wage and consumers who had been tightening their belts.\u0026nbspThe rebound in May saw non-essential spending growth reach a 14-month high of 4.6 per cent, with the warm weather boosting clothing sales by 5.8 per cent, according to the research.The numbers are in stark contrast to the negative impact of the Beast from the East, which dented sales for many retailers as shoppers stayed home to avoid the snow and ice.\u0026nbspNearly a quarter of Brits surveyed said they intend to spend more on experiences this summer. Of those, 35 per cent plan to visit live events such as festivals and a fifth said they are are more likely than usual to go to a pub to watch sport.Despite the strong numbers, UK shoppers have become more pessimistic with 57 per cent saying they are confident in their household finances, down from 62 per cent in April.Esme Harwood,\u0026nbspdirector at Barclaycard, said a degree of caution among UK shoppers remained but this didn’t stop people enjoying the sunshine.“This brought good news for the high street as Brits updated their wardrobes – with growth on clothes going up by the highest amount in two years – and took to pub gardens to enjoy the blue skies,” she said.“Looking ahead, it seems the experience economy will remain a top priority as consumers plan to treat themselves to major music and sporting events. In the next few months, we expect to see families carefully balancing their budgets to ensure they don’t miss out on their must-see and must-do experiences of the summer.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Once, after a 12-hour shift I was exhausted and had to wait for the last woman to leave.I popped my head around the communal showers to find her shaving her legs. Five minutes later she was clipping her toenails and casually flicking them into the drain.Couples do get frisky in the pool and I regularly had to put an end to it. If the black-death stare didn’t work then Id loudly point out that there are children present. They usually stopped.It was in the family changing room were the real action went on though. Men and women can use them together - so they did.It was a familiar scene when I peered under the door. A pair of feet, a pair of knees and lots of toes twitching. I’d have to hammer on the door brazenly shouting, Are you nearly done!We’d all stand in reception knowing exactly which couple had been doing the deed. Their walk of shame was always priceless. It was usually teenagers who obviously didn’t have any privacy at home.Kids can be a bit of a nightmare when they over-swim. If theyre going to be sick they rarely wait to get to the changing rooms.I’ve had enough barf upchucked on my toes to last me a lifetime.They also go to the loo as and when the fancy takes them.

She looked like Borat in his fluro mankini.I couldnt let her go in the pool like that, so had to discreetly break it to her that it was on the wrong way round.Its a great job to do though.  I would recommend it to anyone even if it means having to sit in wet undies all day after having rescued a nipper from the shallow end.Zoe Apostolides, 27, lives in London. She worked as a lifeguard aged 16-20.Zoe says: I became a lifeguard at 16 and on Saturdays Id get to my local pool in South West London for 5am.My least favourite job was clearing out the sauna area, which involved scraping out the human fat that collected in the grates underneath.It was really thick, pale orange and smelled awful: like sweat and fry-ups.  Itd get under your fingernails and leave greasy marks on the red-and-yellow uniforms we wore.Afterwards wed collect the clumps and put them in human-waste bags before tossing them into a special bin.Another grim job was picking up dead cockroaches. Sometimes the pest controllers would put down poison but thered always be a few ready to dart out from under the changing rooms.We had a special net to fish out floating poo, but if someone bled in the water wed have to clear the pool and close it for the day.Louise Humphries, 53, lives in Leicester. She was a lifeguard aged 18-23Louise says: Hygiene goes out the window for most bathers when theyre in their swimsuits. I’ve been handed a child’s poo by a mum who announced, I don’t think this belongs to my child.Momentarily speechless, I spluttered, well, just leave it on the side then! When this happens the pool has to be cleaned.Hair clogging up the shower plugs was a classic daily thing us life guards had to yank out of drains.One place I worked at had a sauna and spa, and the men-only nights proved to be an education. One night I spotted a man head down in the hot tub.I panicked and raised the alarm, shouting, “he’s drowning!” I yanked him up and got the surprise of my life when another guy popped up from beneath him. Needless to say neither of them were drowning.So many kids get left on their own in the pool while their parents go and get changed. I’ve had to jump in and haul little ones out of the pool when the wave machines starts and they slip under.I’ve also had to discipline kids. Parents don’t like it, but for me it is safety first.You get used to people treating lifeguards badly - one dad tried to square up to me after I reprimanded his son.Then there was the diabetic who hadn’t eaten enough and passed out. Having to drag him up from the bottom of the pool was a memorable experience.Even today I would never use a public Jacuzzi. The type of swimming I prefer nowadays is strictly in the sea.I’ve got a teenage son and decades on still find myself shouting, “walk don’t run!”  The lifeguard attitude never leaves you. It’s a side of life so few people get to see and yet I would encourage my son to do it. Louise is the owner of Studio44Pilates.Hayley, 50, is a health care assistant from Hunmanby, Yorkshire. She worked as a lifeguard for one season as a teenager.Hayley says: Baywatch it very definitely wasn’t. While no day was ever the same - every morning started in the same fashion: fishing out the debris from the night before.The pool was open air, there were no fences or security cameras. So it was down to us to skim off the floating used condoms, bottles and other rubbish that had been chucked into the pool during the nocturnal hours.We’d draw short straws for who would dredge the bottom of the baths.When I lost out I’d find used tampons, verruca socks, plasters and other things that people somehow inexplicably lost while they were swimming.I lost count of the number of times I had to gently reprimand mums and dads for letting their toddlers wee in the plastic grating that went around the pool.They thought it was a drain, when it was really the filtration system for cleaning the water they swam in.And when parents let their kids wee in the pool you know exactly what they are doing during those thirty seconds they’re standing still.The person in charge of maintaining the chemical composition of the pool didn’t check it everyday either.The pool was undoubtedly half water, half urine at times.I also got used to seeing more willies and boobs in one summer than I’ve ever seen since.Girls in skimpy bikinis will never ever learn that if you dive in that string won’t hold the ‘girls’ in.Guys are just as bad and were forever pulling down each other’s swimming trunks.The pool had a glass panel at one side. I lost count of how many times a day swimmers would moon at stunned families innocently walking by.Working that summer season in a holiday camp pool put me off swimming in public baths for life. I only go now to private ones in posh health centres.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

In contrast, the creative sector has 15 supporting staff.It also said the department is packed with “career civil servants”, who lack the necessary skills or experience.And the maritime experts said a lack of resources and poor prioritisation had put UK’s ambition to become a global trading nation after Brexit under threat.Maritime UK chief Ben Murray concluded that Mr Fox’s department is in danger of throwing away the “tremendous opportunities” that Brexit offers Britain.He blasted: “Within the DIT, there is currently a chronic lack of direct industry experience. While the department has taken steps to take on a new crop of Trade Commissionaires in response to the increased workload, a huge percentage of these are career civil servants.“How can we possibly expect individuals who have spent their lives outside of industry to understand the real requirements of UK business wanting to sell overseas? How can they be relied upon to make day-to-day decisions on how to deploy scant HMG funds to UK companies?They may well be honest hardworking civil servants but in what way are they qualified to do this?

The BBC presenter angrily confronted the Prime Minister following the disaster last June - a clash that left Mrs May floundering and branded inhuman on social media. Speaking to Radio Times Magazine, the Newsnight host admitted: Friends told me it was the angriest they had ever seen me. The reason I went so hard that day was because - I think - I had heard and seen the anger first hand, she said. This was no longer an intellectual exercise. But Maitlis, who volunteered by sorting donations before broadcasting from the scene, said she still felt sympathy for Mrs May. The Prime Minister faced a huge public backlash last year for failing to immediately meet victims of the disaster that killed 72 people. In a second visit an angry crowd surrounded her car and screamed “coward” and “May must go”.  During the painful interview, Maitlis told the PM: You misread the public mood on this one. You misread the anger that people feel about this. They shouted coward after you this afternoon. In robotic fashion, May answered: What I have done since this incident took place is, first of all yesterday, ensure that public services had the support that they needed in order to be able to do the job they were doing in the immediate aftermath. Maitlis interjected: But that\u0027s three days on, Prime Minister, this is Friday evening. They needed those things in place on Wednesday. No one was in charge.   Looking back a year after the fire, Maitlis said: Let me say here, for the record, that actually I had enormous sympathy for Theresa May that day. She looked spent and exhausted a week after a failed election, a summer of terrorism and tragedy on this inconceivable scale. Maitlis said that the tragedy horrified and disturbed me for many nights to come. She added: Survivors were turning up, shell-shocked and looking for someone to tell them what to do, where to go. There were very few people in authority there. That day was powered by volunteers - amazing people who got their act together when no-one else seemed to have a clue what to do.

Richard Smith, the surgeon planning to carry out the first transplant in the UK, has set the two-year target and revealed that his medical team now plans to use living donors. He hopes the first transplants will take place before the end of this year thanks to a pioneering medical technique, but \u0026pound30,000 is needed for every patient. Three women hoping to realise their dreams of motherhood will undergo surgery within the next few months using wombs donated by a mother or sister, it was reported.  Doctors in the UK were granted approval to carry out Britain\u0027s first 10 womb transplants in 2015 using wombs from deceased donors whose hearts are still functioning. But Mr Smith, a consultant gynaecologist who leads researchers at the charity Womb Transplant UK, said his team will now use both live and deceased donors.  Mr Smith, of Queen Charlotte\u0027s and Chelsea Hospital in London, told the BBC that retrieving a womb from a live donor is now simpler and safer than it was just a few years ago.  The surgery time has been drastically reduced from 12 to four hours.  Mr Smith said the risks of clot formation, deep vein thrombosis and damage to pelvic organs have been greatly reduced. About 750 women have contacted his team to enquire about womb transplantation. Mr Smith\u0027s team has been in contact with about 50 potential recipients after a preliminary selection process, and the patients will be chosen within weeks. They include women with relatives willing to donate their wombs. Womb Transplant UK is hoping to complete 15 transplants - five with living, related donors - but so far only has enough funds to pay for three operations.

In her passionate response to the cosmetics giant\u0027s campaign, the cop admits that she is indeed \u0027paid to lie\u0027 - before listing several lies that she has told on the job. Recalling one heartbreaking instance where she spent eight hours of a 10-hour shift cradling a baby girl in her arms, she describes how she whispered an untruth to her. Her mother was in police custody for stabbing her father. Social Services were too stretched to attend, she writes in her powerful message, shared on Facebook . I used my own money to buy her milk and nappies. A member of the public remonstrated with me when they saw me buying these supplies, said I was \u0027wasting taxpayers\u0027 money doing my shopping when I should have been serving the public\u0027. I rocked that baby to sleep, her tear stained cheek on mine. To read the officer\u0027s response, scroll down  I whispered to her, I promised her she would be fine. She wasn’t. She is now a teenager my colleagues deal with her daily. She is not fine. I lied. Referring to another incident, the officer tells Lush - which has defended its campaign and denied being \u0027anti-police\u0027 - how she talked a suicidal man down from a balcony. She says she convinced him that he had everything to live for. He came down. I saved his life that night, she writes. I referred him to the appropriate agencies to support him through his crisis. He engaged with Mental Health Services for a while. He killed himself the following year. He left a suicide note saying he didn’t have anything to live for. I lied. She then goes on to describe her first \u0027sudden death\u0027 as a then-police constable. I was 23 and the male that passed away was 21, she says. I performed CPR whilst waiting for paramedics to attend. Any opportunities to save his life failed and he was pronounced dead. I checked his whole body for any suspicious activity and then I confirmed his death to his parents and his younger siblings. This is not an anti-state/anti-police campaign. We are aware that the police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed. We fully support them in having proper police numbers, correctly funded to fight crime, violence and to be there to serve the public at our times of need.  This campaign is not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day - it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.  Our campaign is to highlight this small and secretive subset of undercover policing that undermines and threatens the very idea of democracy. There is an age old understanding that our government and public institutions are there to protect and preserve the rights and safety of the public.  In the case of these secretive undercover units, their work went well beyond the boundaries of acceptable police tactics and is now the subject of an ongoing public inquiry, which was instigated by Theresa May during her time as Home Secretary when the scale and scope of the breaches of protocols started to become clear.  This public inquiry needs help from the public to keep it on track and ensure that this one opportunity for full honesty and disclosure is not lost or squandered. All citizens should be concerned when human rights are abandoned by those in power. The police themselves have admitted in their public apology to seven of the females deceived into long-term relationships with police spies, that these actions were a violation of the women’s human rights, an abuse of police power and caused significant trauma”. In a recent court case the police admitted the actions amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment breaching Article 3 of the European Declaration of Human Rights. Those victims are now asking that the public inquiry demands that the undercover units release a full list of the undercover names used by their operatives, release a list of which campaign groups were targeted, and also that they release the information and data entries they hold on individuals whose lives and homes were infiltrated during these operations. Without this full disclosure there is no way of knowing the full extent of what happened during the dark years of this renegade secret policing operation - and that full disclosure might not happen unless the public demand it.  It was the first dead body I had seen since my own Grandad had died. This happened 19 years ago. I can still smell the air freshener in that house. My sergeant asked me if I was okay. I was not okay. I lied. The woman, who has made her way up the ranks from constable to inspector over her 16-year career, also recalls a number of other instances where she lied while at work. Her message, addressed to Lush, was shared on the UK Cop Humour Facebook page . She tells the cosmetics firm: I have seen your front window display and the accusation that as a police officer I am \u0027Paid to Lie\u0027. I have given this considerable thought over the last 24 hours. I have looked over my 16-year career, from Constable to Inspector, and I must say that I agree with you wholly and passionately, because I am indeed \u0027Paid to Lie\u0027. She later adds: I lie to those I try to help, to my own colleagues and to my friends and family. I am not alone and I am sure that my colleagues reading this would agree they have done the same. Lush has said it is simply shining a light on intrusive, abusive, political policing amid an ongoing public inquiry into undercover officers\u0027 secretive activities.  However, the officer says: Whilst I can see there may have been good sentiment behind your latest campaign, it has been appallingly executed. Believe me nobody wants to see a corrupt practise or a corrupt officer held to account more than a decent hard-working officer. Unfortunately, your abhorrent window display depicts something far more sinister. The policewoman\u0027s response comes amid a huge backlash over posters that recently popped up in windows of Lush stores and appeared on the firm\u0027s website . Some have accused the company, based in Poole, Dorset, of being anti-police- while supporters of police have called for a boycott of the chain. However, Lush has defended the campaign and denied the allegations that it is anti-police. The campaign includes window displays featuring the slogan Paid to lie, along with police tape and a split image of a man wearing a police hat and a nose piercing. It uses the hashtag spycops on social media and is due to run through most of June.  The campaign, which has been reported to the Advertising Standards Authority, takes aim at undercover policing and in particular the activities of secretive Special Demonstration Squad of the Met Police, which infiltrated protest groups from the 1960s to the 1990s. The chain is supporting women who it says were tricked into sexual relationships with undercover officers, drawing attention to human rights abuses against them, and pressuring the government to make the inquiry more transparent. A police investigation - Operation Herne - was set up in October 2011 to look into allegations made against the SDS, including using dead children’s identities. Police were forced to apologise and pay out \u0026pound425,000 to a woman who had a child with Special Branch detective Bob Lambert, who was working undercover and spying on a protest group of which she was a member. The Undercover Policing Inquiry into undercover policing in Britain is now taking place, but is still in its early stages despite opening three years ago. In a press release, Mark Constantine OBE, Lush\u0027s co-founder and managing director, said: Confidence in the police will never be restored until this public inquiry does its job”.  West Midlands Police Crime Commissioner David Jamieson earlier slammed the campaign, calling it crass and saying it was written by an inexperienced PR consultant. He said: This is a crass and insensitive campaign. Police officers put their lives on the line day in day out. Lush have needlessly waded into a highly complex area. He added: This firm relies on the police to do their job tackling shoplifting and other crimes against businesses. This is a puerile and immature campaign, clearly written by an inexperienced PR consultant. I will certainly be considering where I buy Mrs Jamieson’s bath bombs from in future. Others may do the same. Che Donald, vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, was also among those to have blasted the campaign. He tweeted: This is very poorly thought out campaign @LushLtd \u0026amp damaging to the overwhelmingly large majority of police who have nothing to do with this undercover enquiry. I will now clear my house of any of your products and my family and friends will never use them again. #FlushLush.  Lynne Owens, director general of the National Crime Agency, added: Undercover policing is a highly specialised \u0026amp regulated tactic undertaken by brave officers to protect the public from the most serious offenders. I’d encourage @LushLtd to visit @NCA_UK to receive a contemporary briefing. The Advertising Standards Authority said on Twitter: We\u0027ve received complaints about the @LushLtd police campaign and are currently assessing the complaints. Lush are not under investigation at this stage. Lush explained on its website how it has partnered with the PSOOL and COPS groups to get their message spread further through the campaign. The groups have started an online petition asking new Home Secretary Sajid Javid to make major changes to the inquiry, set up in 2015 by then Home Secretary Theresa May, to improve transparency. They wrote: The public inquiry is in danger of collapsing due to secrecy and derailment. We urge you to listen to the victims and instruct a panel of experts to assist the Chair, extend the inquiry to Scotland, disclose the cover names of the officers, the names of the groups they spied on and release the personal files of victims. Lush stores are stocked with postcards that customers can sign and send to the Home Secretary to back the campaigners.  Releasing the information will allow more people to come forward with evidence at the inquiry, which only covers England and Wales, the campaigners argue. In a statement about its campaign, Lush said: This is not an anti-state/anti-police campaign. We are aware that the police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed. It added: This campaign is not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day - it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.

There is an age old understanding that our government and public institutions are there to protect and preserve the rights and safety of the public. I agree with you wholly: Policewoman\u0027s response The emotional message, purportedly written by a long-serving policewoman, was shared on the UK Cop Humour Facebook page yesterday morning. It reads: Dear Lush UK, I have seen your front window display and the accusation that as a police officer I am \u0027Paid to Lie\u0027. I have given this considerable thought over the last 24 hours. I have looked over my 16-year career, from Constable to Inspector, and I must say that I agree with you wholly and passionately, because I am indeed \u0027Paid to Lie\u0027. I Lied. I spent 8 hours of a 10-hour shift cradling a young baby in my arms. Her Mother was in Police Custody for stabbing her Father. Social Services were too stretched to attend. I used my own money to buy her milk and nappies. A member of the public remonstrated with me when they saw me buying these supplies, said I was \u0027Wasting Tax Payer’s money doing my shopping when I should have been serving the public\u0027 (sic). I rocked that baby to sleep, her tear stained cheek on mine. I whispered to her, I promised her she would be fine. She wasn’t. She is now a teenager my colleagues deal with her daily. She is not fine. I lied. I lied. I talked a suicidal male down from the balcony of his own flat. He was on the ‘wrong’ side and said he had nothing to live for. I spent an hour talking to him, convincing him that he had everything to live for. He came down. I saved his life that night. I referred him to the appropriate agencies to support him through his crisis. He engaged with Mental Health Services for a while. He killed himself the following year. He left a suicide note saying he didn’t have anything to live for. I lied.

Venitia Sorhaindo, who has a rare structural defect, said she suffers agonising daily pain that is so intense she can only sleep for around two hours a night.  The 32-year-old told Bristol Live she hears \u0027squishing noises in her head like she is drowning\u0027 and her own heartbeat is a constant banging.  The Bristol woman is now totally dependant on carers to carry her out of her wheelchair and bed and she eats liquid meals through a tube.  In a desperate bid to improve her condition, known as Chiari Malformation, she has launched a last-chance fundraising bid to raise \u0026pound72,000 for life-saving surgery in the US.   Venitia\u0027s life was very different five years ago. Despite being born with the condition, it was only after risky brain surgery that her life was turned upside down. Before the procedure she was able to walk and take her little 11-year-old girl, Akeelah, swimming. But in 2013, when doctors discovered the structural defects in the base of the skull and cerebellum, - the part of the brain that controls balance - and she was told without an operation she could have less than two months to live. Since the surgery, she says her life is now unbearable and she fears she cannot continue living with such intense pain every day. Her only hope is to travel to America - a world leader when it comes to treating Chiari Malformation - and undergo more opertions. However, for this she needs to raise a staggering \u0026pound72,000.

Despite this when the Daily Mirror received a dramatic telephone call at 10.15am on May 1, 1968 no-one could have predicted the tale which would emerge. A man said he wanted to talk about a friend and a serious crime. He was to solve a mystery which had baffled police who had been called to a countryside cottage where firefighters had found a body. The mystery caller said he would arrive at the office in about fifteen minutes. At 10.30am, the man arrived at the main door in London\u0027s Holborn and was shown to a third floor waiting room.  He was scruffily dressed and looked tired. In quiet, jerky sentences, he told about a crime that he said he knew had been committed. He said he had a friend who knew all about a murder and he was waiting at London Bridge railway station. At first, he would not give his name, but as details tumbled out he could not keep up his pretence. There is no friend, it is me, he confessed. He was 28-year-old Hungarian chef Imre Gathy, and he described how on the Saturday before he had left his wife and two young children, at home in Harrington Road, Brighton. He said he had rowed with his wife after losing his job and had set out to look for work.  As he walked out of the seaside town along the A23 towards Gatwick a car pulled up. Inside was a man who it later transpired was retired naval Lieutenant Commander Humphrey Gilbert Grace. Grace had had a religious conversion almost a decade before when his mother had died suddenly. While he was away at the funeral his younger son was blinded in one eye in an accident. Since then, he had developed a fondness for picking up down and outs and taking them back his family home while his wife was away.  On this weekend Mr Grace\u0027s wife and teenage daughter were on holiday in Greece and two sons at boarding school when he offered Gathy a lift. The 29-year-old got into the green 1965 Morris Mini-traveller and the pair drove off towards Gatwick. As they got near Gatwick, Gathy said he asked to be dropped off as he knew the manager of the airline canteen. But Grace said that he could call him from his nearby home, and so they drove to October House. Once inside Gathy said he had a wash and called his friend at Gatwick Airport at 4pm, but it was his day off. He had tea with Grace, and, according to Gathy, the retired naval officer started to talk about God and read from the Bible until about 11pm.  Grace then showed his guest to a bedroom, which was a back room with a single bed where he slept until the morning. The next morning, Gathy said that he wanted to contact his wife, but claims that Grace said that he should let her wait adding that the man should wear the trousers. Reports at the time said that Gathy claimed later that Grace came out directly talking about the subject of homosexuality, saying that the Bible spoke of \u0027Love thy neighbour\u0027 - he took it to mean that you could love another man like your wife. He claimed Grace\u0027s response was to put his hand on the top of his leg. Gathy said he struck Grace with the back of his fist and that the older man jumped up and started shouting and screaming. He said that he then came towards him and he fell out of the back of his chair. Gathy said he grabbed a doorstop and hit the commander over the head - killing him. He said he panicked, and thinking he would make the crime look like a robbery, stole some silverware and fled back to Brighton. He twice tried to set fire to the house where he had killed Mr Grace, but the fire did not take and smoke was spotted by neighbours who alerted fire fighters who found the body. Gathy said he decided to hand himself in, but instead of going to the police station called the Daily Mirror to confess.

This squeamish clip shows Neel Raithatha carrying out the procedure on a client who was suffering from a condition called Keratosis Obturan. The Wax Whisperer said: Keratosis Obturan is an accumulation of large plugs of dead skin in the ear canal. Under normal circumstances, the skin would come out of the ear canal naturally but there was a large pimple near the entrance of the canal which stopped this from happening. This pimple was most likely to have been a boil filled with blood and pus which had been caused by a bacterial infection.  Although not a dangerous health problem, the Wax Whisperer said this build up of dead skin, if left untreated, can lead to an erosion of the ear canal. Removing the pimple and the skin at his clinic in Leicester, he said that the procedure took around seven minutes when it should\u0027ve taken two.

For the residents of Kensington Palace , they do things a little differently.   These glamorous inhabitants include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (and family), Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as well as Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank .  Instead of just driving up to their front doors and rummaging in their bags for their keys like the rest of us, they have a much more sneaky and elaborate way of getting in.   When coming back to Kensington Palace, the Royal family shun the street entrance and are literally flown  into Hyde Park in the grounds of the palace.  A chauffeured car then waits for the royals and whisks them off to their home, while armed police officers stand guard on the lawn.

Convicted drug dealer Sam Walker, from Liverpool, mocked police on camera saying: Better luck trying to catch me when I go out of the country next time, Merseyside Police.” The criminal, who has clocked up more than 100 crimes, fled to Sierra Leone using private jets and a cargo ship. Despite his criminal past, Walker is considered a hero in the country\u0027s capital Freetown after paying for fresh water pipes and tanks to be fitted in the area. Walker claimed he faced being jailed in the UK for skipping court over breaking an alleged driving ban.  His video, shown to pals on Snapchat and Instagram, was titled: “How to get out of UK when you\u0027re wanted by police. Can’t use an airport coz they will nick you.” The footage shows Walker flying in a private plane to Belgium. He then takes another personal flight to Barcelona, Spain, before hitching a “little 14-hour boat trip” to Morocco. He is then driven across Africa for three days - across the Sahara, Mauritania and Senegal - to Guinea before taking another boat to Freetown.  Walker, whose grandfather was from Sierra Leone, claims he was forced to evade police because his court date clashed with the departure of a shipping container from the UK filled with charity donations. He now faces a longer prison stretch when he returns home - but in the meantime has enjoyed time with Sierra Leone’s vice-president, Mohammed Juldeh Jalloh. Speaking from the country, Walker insisted: “I was in a Catch-22. I had to fulfil my promise to the people in the slums, knowing full well that when am caught I will get the maximum sentence of four months in jail plus two months for missing my court date.  “But to me the people were more important. The court date could wait. Sometimes in life you have to do the wrong thing in the eyes of the law in order to do the right thing.” Walker has been in and out of prison since his teenage years and made front page headlines when he publicly threatened former Everton and England star Barkley. The sinister Twitter message, sparked in a row over an ex-girlfriend of the footballer, said: “Inbox me a number for you, ya little rat! “You know wot this is about so don’t play stupid or your footie career will come to an end!” He now claims to have spent thousands on installing fresh water pipes for the slums of Sierra Leone after seeing “men, women and children dying”.  Walker said: “I managed to convince them to start fitting a fresh water line for them and I paid for it there and then to make sure it was 100% being done. They have installed a 5,000 litre water tank in the slums so no woman or child has to ever drink dirty water again.” Yet Walker, who has been in and out of prison since a teenager, denies he is a changed person despite the charitable mission. He admitted: “I have not just woke up and changed overnight. I am still the same person and still do what I do. “But that does not mean I can’t help the people who need it and give them a voice. “I know when I come back to the UK I will be arrested at the airport and put straight in jail. “I can deal with that knowing that I have fulfilled my promise to the people in the slums by giving them a container full of toys, clothes and food and given them fresh clean water so no man, woman or child ever has to risk their lives by drinking dirty sewage water again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"your holiday destination safe government","story":"NewsIs your holiday destination safe?

But tourists have been warned to avoid certain areas unless it\u0027s essential, with the threat of terror attacks in several places in Europe and beyond. Where is safe to go and where should you avoid travelling to? What precautions should you take while travelling? Here we take a look at the UK Government’s travel advice for destinations across the globe. Turkey  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all travel to within 10 km of the border with Syria and to the city of Diyarbakir.  The FCO said: Fighting in Syria continues in areas close to the Turkish border and there remains a heightened risk of terrorism in the region. They warned that presidential and parliamentary elections will take place on 24 June 2018 which may result in rallies and demonstrations around the country. You should avoid large gatherings and follow the advice of the local authorities, the advice added. Added security measures may apply to flights from Turkey to the UK.  Egypt Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt, the FCO says. People have been told they should always be vigilant and follow advice of Egyptian authorities and travel companies. Threats to western nationals, institutions and businesses have been posted on websites and social media. The FCO has advised against travel - unless it\u0027s essential- to the Governorate of South Sinai with the exception of the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq. But people have been advised against all but essential travel by air to or from Sharm el Sheikh. Places to avoid also include the area west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions, excluding the coastal areas between the Nile Delta and Marsa Matruh.  Spain Barcelona and other areas in the region of Catalonia have seen large gatherings because of the political developments in the region. And the Government has warned more demonstrations could take place. They may occur with little or no warning and even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can escalate and turn confrontational, the FCO says. You should exercise caution if you’re in the vicinity. Demonstrations may also cause some disruption and delays to transport services. The FCO have also urged people to not take unnecessary risks, especially when under the influence of alcohol after several deaths as a result from people falling from balconies. They also warned people to be aware of the existence of street crime as thieves tend to target money and passports.  Greece Terrorist attacks in Greece can’t be ruled out, the FCO says. Brits have been told to apply for a free European Health Insurance Card and to carry their passport or photo ID showing British nationality at all times. Some medical costs are not covered by the European Health Insurance Card so people have been told to get comprehensive medical and travel insurance before going to Greece. The FCO says: Greek police won’t accept rowdy or indecent behaviour, especially where excessive drinking is involved. Greek courts impose heavy fines or prison sentences on people who behave indecently. Your travel insurance may not cover you after drinking.  France It is very likely that terrorists carry out attacks in France, according to the Goverment. The country has had ongoing threats by Islamist terrorist groups. The French government has advised the public to be vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. People should also be aware that a number of strikes are being planned on SNCF trains until June 28 and should check travel advice.  USA Terror attacks in the USA are very likely and could be indiscriminate, the Government has warned. People should be vigilant and check reports in the press. The US Department of Homeland Security is to start implementing separate enhanced security screening procedures for all commercial flights to the US.

Trump tonight issued a statement uninviting the Philadelphia Eagles from a White House visit due to the ongoing kneeling row. He claimed he was taking the decision because not all of the team were planning on attending and \u0027the fans deserve better\u0027. But Philly\u0027s mayor Jim Kenney wasn\u0027t going to take that lying down, and hit back with a strongly worded statement of his own.  He said: The Eagles call the birthplace of our democracy home, so it\u0027s no surprise that this team embodies everything that makes our country and our city great. Their athletic accomplishments on the field led to an historic victory this year. Fans all across the country rallied behind them because we like to root for the underdog and we feel joy when we see the underdogs finally win. I\u0027m proud of the Eagles\u0027 activism off the field. These are players who stand up for their causes they believe in and who contribute in meaningful ways to their community. They represent the diversity of our nation - a nation in which we are free to express our opinions. Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our President is not a true patriot but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend. City Hall is always open for a celebration.  Trump has repeatedly insisted players should stand during the national anthem at the start of football games, while a number of players in the last year have taken a knee in protest against police violence against Africans Americans. Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith previously said he wouldn\u0027t be going - and has hit out at Trump\u0027s statement tonight.  The Trump statement says: The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow. They disagree with their President because he insists they stand proudly for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honour of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country. The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony - one that will honour our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem. I will be there at 3pm with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus to celebrate America. Shortly after, Smith tweeted the following, accusing the president of being a liar.   The Eagles claimed the NFL\u0027s biggest prize in February, defeating last year\u0027s champions New England Patriots 41-33 in Minnesota. Days later it emerged a number of players would boycott the trip to the White House to meet President Trump, following their Super Bowl success. Many players in the NFL have been critical of President Trump\u0027s comments on race relations, with the president labelling the league weak and out of control back in October.

When the aspiring hair stylist first saw him, she says she was instantly attracted and intrigued by his musical talent. While the situation felt strange for the both of them at first, the couple learned to realize that it gave them things they never had in a relationship before. Despite harsh criticism from her friends and parents, Samantha knew it was rare for her to find a stable, kind and mature man who also shares her love for outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking.  Now that they’ve spent six months together, she says it is the best relationship she’s every had.  She said: “When I saw him playing the guitar, I knew I wanted to approach him at the end. It was love at first sight.  “He was very good looking and I loved hearing him play the guitar. “Once we started talking, I realized that he liked all the same outdoorsy things that I do an he even makes his own kayaks out of wood. “His age freaked me out a little bit in the beginning, especially when I found out that his kids are 35 and 40.  “My friends used to laugh at me and tell me that I was dating a grandpa. My mom was really uncomfortable with it at first, but now everyone is used to him. “It hurt my feelings a lot. In my opinion, he’s the best out of everyone I’ve dated, but I couldn’t show anyone that because they were all focusing on his age. “He is stable both financially and emotionally and he treats me well.” As someone who has been divorced three times, Maxie was drawn to how nice the cosmetology student is. However, he was a bit discouraged by her young age and did not think about her in a romantic way at first. Maxie, a school teacher, said: “She was so nice to me. I didn’t even think of her in a romantic sense at first. I just saw her as someone who was really kind.  “The age difference scared the hell out of me, but I couldn’t just throw away an opportunity to be with someone this great.” While she makes him happy, Maxie has avoided introducing Samantha to most of his friends because of the fear of judgement. He said: “She has not meshed with all of my friends yet. I’m hopeful that time will make that easier. “I don’t have this 100 percent figured out yet, but the lack of pressure from her certainly helps.” "},{"url":null,"title":"doctors remove foot long aubergine","story":"NewsDoctors remove foot-long AUBERGINE from man\u0027s intestines after he shoved it up his rectum for odd reasonThe egg-shaped, glossy aubergine remained in the man\u0027s body for two days before he finally sought medical attention\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByScott Feng09:59, 5 JUN 2018Updated10:05, 5 JUN 2018NewsA medic holds the aubergine after it was removed from the man\u0027s body (Image: AsiaWire / Kan Kan News)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Doctors have removed a foot-long aubergine that got stuck inside a man\u0027s intestines after he shoved the fruit up his rectum to help him go to the toilet.  The man was constipated and he was so desperate to cure his ailment he thought the egg-shaped, glossy food would do the trick, it was claimed. But his DIY treatment - which he thought would expand his colon - backfired. The 12-inch aubergine remained in the 50-year-old man\u0027s body for two days - as he suffered abdominal pain and vomiting - before he finally sought medical attention.  The man told doctors in China that he had been suffering from constipation and nausea for two days when he decided to insert the aubergine into his anus and up his rectum in a bid to expand his colon, according to reports. He had hoped the folk remedy would help ease his pain, but the smooth, long fruit was inserted far too deep and ended up inside his body. Scans showed it having travelled up his large intestine and lodged itself at an angle in his abdomen.  Incredibly, he suffered through two more days of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting before finally seeking help. Medics treating the man on May 30 retrieved the aubergine whole, saying that the fruit was so far up his body that it caused lung inflammation and a ruptured bowel. It is unclear, however, whether his constipation symptoms were relieved.  Cruel social media users on Weibo ridiculed the man over his unfortunate situation. One user wrote Now stick some potatoes and green peppers up there and you\u0027ll get \u0027di san xian\u0027, referring to the Chinese dish which translates as \u0027treasures of the earth\u0027.

In fact, it\u0027s quite the opposite. Former Star Trek star George Takei recently shared a video of the salad, which is in fact a cake with some unusual ingredients.  The salad creation by Otchcakes, who specialise in making life-like treats like this salad. Previous designs include cakes shaped like Starbucks coffees, raw mince and even a packet of romaine lettuce. If this tickles your fancy, then there is some bad news - it\u0027s VERY tricky to recreate. Talented baker Jennifer, from How To Cake That, attempted the cake, and had to use real lettuce leaves to mould fake ones using food colouring, vodka and wafer paper.

Maybe it\u0027s chewing with your mouth wide open, or being stingy , or supporting the wrong team. The list is long and the possibilities of what counts as unacceptable behaviour are endless. Just ask Haley Byrd, from Washington, USA who is now being urged to dump her boyfriend , Evan Wilt, by concerned members of the public. But what was his crime? Kicking a puppy? Walking out of a restaurant without paying the bill? Revealing he\u0027ll never love anyone as much as he loves his bogey collection? No, it all came down to how he ate a Kit Kat, which he did for the first time recently (which is odd in itself).   Haley shared a photo of Evan\u0027s attempt to eat a Kit Kat on Twitter and, while we don\u0027t want to judge too harshly, it is pretty bizarre. Not exactly the most neutral place in the world. Twitter soon erupted into calls for Haley to end her relationship.        In any case, Haley later updated everyone to announce: Internet — I appreciate your feedback. But Kit Kat crime aside, @EvanWilt_ is a keeper.

The 15ft wife space rock was seen hurtling through the skies, leaving a white-hot trail blazing in its wake. Just moments before the rock could have crash landed on Earth, potentially causing catastrophic damage and wiping out populations, two farmers in the South African wilderness captured the moment it exploded and burned out. Travelling at what NASA believe to be over 37 times the speed of sound, means the rock was just two seconds from hitting South Africa when it vaporised. Farmer Barend Swanepoel had been having coffee on his neighbour’s farm‚ between Ottosdal and Hartbeesfontein‚ and was driving home when he saw the “huge fireball” in the sky.  He said: The advantage I had was I saw it in colour and it was not like on the cameras. It was a fireball falling with this red tail behind and I thought that the grassland is going to burn. The trees next to the gravel road concealed Swanepoel’s view of the final plunge He checked his CCTV and said: One of the small cameras monitoring the barn with feed for his animals caught the footage that you saw on social media. It was incredible to see.  Michelle Starke said on Barend’s Facebook beneath the asteroid footage which sent social media buzzing: We saw two! They both looked the same, very fast, bright and massive.  The International Astronomical Union confirmed the rock entered the Earth’s atmosphere on June 2 and was named Asteroid 2018 LA and was estimated at between 10 to 16 feet wide.

The Volcan de Fuego erupted on Sunday , spilling tonnes of mud into the nearby village of San Miguel Los Lotes.  So far 69 people have been confirmed dead, with 300 injured, although it\u0027s feared as many as 2,000 people are still unaccounted for. As rescuers desperately search for survivors, an officer was seen rescuing a baby girl from a ditch in the city of Escuintla. Wearing a dust mask, the young official scales a ladder with the baby in his arms.  A colleague is heard saying: That is great, a little girl. Thank God. Local authorities were reportedly searching for bodies under the layers of ash and rubble in the area when they found the baby. It is the country\u0027s deadliest volcanic eruption since the Santa Maria disaster of 1902. The eruption prompted the evacuation of around 3,100 people from nearby areas. The La Aurora International Airport was closed, although it has since reopened after some routes were cancelled.  The eruption produced a near 10-mile-high ash column. Fast-moving clouds of hot gas and volcanic matter caused many of the casualties. Heavy rainfall during the eruption led to the formation of dangerous mudflows which buried several villages in volcanic material and cut off roads. Guatemala\u0027s national institute of volcanology has warned that further pyroclastic flows and lahars are possible.

Thomas Owen Hughes, 20, was found lying dead below the Eden Roc apartment block yesterday morning at around 11am. It is thought he leapt over a wall, thinking the hotel corridor continued on the other side. He was initially described by police on the island as Irish - but this morning they said he was British. Investigators also said they believed he fell to his death after mistaking the apartment block where he fell for his holiday hotel.  Mr Hughes is understood to have been staying at Magaluf’s Universal Hotel Florida, close to the Eden Roc block. Sources at the local Civil Guard, the force investigating Mr Hughes in conjunction with a local court, said today they believed the death was a tragic accident. One said: “Investigators suspect he may have mistaken the building he fell from with his hotel which is just a couple of doors away and jumped over a wall at the end of a corridor thinking the corridor continued the other side.  “The only thing the other side of the wall was a drop of around 65 feet. “Investigations are continuing but there is nothing at this stage to suggest his death was the result of a crime and suicide appears to have been ruled out.” The results of the autopsy - which was due to be carried out today in the island capital Palma - have not been revealed. Police have not said what time they think he died and whether he had been drinking in the run-up to the tragedy. He had only arrived in Majorca with friends the day before he was found dead.  Friends took to Facebook to express their shock at what had happened.

The surveillance footage, which was filmed in an Indian village 50 miles outside New Delhi, shows the man calmly leading away his boss\u0027s daughter from the shop where he worked. The man, known as Bholu, reportedly took the girl to the house he shared with his mother before raping and stabbing her. He then attempted to cover his tracks by allegedly hiding her body in a container before returning to the shop. According to police, Bholu later volunteered to help find the girl when her parents reported her missing.  Despite the alleged cover-up, suspicion later fell on Bholu when a neighbour reported seeing him walking home with the girl. According to reports, the search party then descended on Bholu\u0027s house and made the gruesome discovery. A medical examination later confirmed the child had been raped before being killed.  The unidentified girl\u0027s father told reporters Bholu, who had worked for the family for nine years, had played along with the search. He added that he wanted to see him hanged if convicted for the rape and killing of his daughter. Bholu, who is married, has been arrested for the crime and is being questioned by police.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b11714d7de2f-e1528187366116.jpg

fantastic, from the youngest being four to the oldest 77, we had a great time with a lovely group of people.Music a big part of life for Dundee music tutor\u0026#8220Each person was given the

in the following week for lessons.\u0026#8220But the most important thing for us was seeing the enjoyment and happiness people felt whilst taking their lessons,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Our team of tutors had a great weekend passing on some of their knowledge and after 22 hours of teaching for free they all agreed that they found it so rewarding that they would do it again!\u0026#8220So we have decided that we should host this type of event numerous times throughout the year.\u0026#8220In fact we noticed that lots of people missed out on the chance to get a free music lesson due to prior commitments and variety of different reasons so we want to offer everyone at any time the chance to book in a try a first lesson for free with any of our tutors.\u0026#8221He said the benefits

play an instrument.\u0026#8220Playing an instrument increases memory, enhances coordination, teaches discipline, perseverance and patience, builds confidence, sharpens your concentration, relieves stress and allows self-expression, it creates a sense of achievement as you develop your ability, and there are so many more benefits but most of all, it’s make you happy and everyone deserves to feel

We’ve got a great neighbourhood, everybody knows everybody.“It’s really annoying that they are not looking further into it.“Nobody has got back to me about it.“We just want to find out what happened to them.”Kathleen told the Tele she had contacted her MP, Stewart Hosie, who said he would contact the housing department.Mr Hosie, who represents Dundee East, said: “We have written to the council to inquire as to whether it was were aware if the items had been moved or taken as the work was carrying on.“We are waiting for an answer.”A spokesman for SSE said: “We employed a contractor to complete work on a number of properties on Balmoral Gardens.“However, we are not aware of a barbecue being moved and have not received a complaint of this nature to date.“If the customer is willing to provide their contact details or address we will be more than happy to look into the case for them.”Dundee City Council declined to comment when approached by the Evening .\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b11601f0db9d.jpg ","title":"dundee united invest 20000 so tannadice continues to be one of the best surfaces in the country","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are investing over £20,000 this summer to make sure they have the best playing surface in the Championship.Since manager Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November, he’s stressed the need for a pristine pitch to match the passing style he wants from the Tangerines.And while last season the surface was the envy of most of their second-tier rivals, the board have stumped up five figures to make sure it’s even better next term and beyond.They announced this week the existing turf has been lifted and a process known as vertical sand-banding started.While that’s a complicated, as well as expensive, process, the new and improved pitch will be ready when the first of the Betfred Cup group matches kick off there in as little as six weeks.The work being carried out will also improve drainage – something that has been a problem, particularly in the area near the tunnel at the Eddie Thompson Stand end of Tannadice.And, while most of the budget for the next 12 months is going on putting together a squad capable of winning promotion, chairman Mike Martin is viewing the pitch project as a sound investment.“We are investing in our on and off-field operations in a structured way with every aspect of our work designed to deliver improvement throughout the club,” he said.“In this case, we aim to make sure that Tannadice continues to be one of the best surfaces in the country for playing professional football.”Those Betfred Cup fixtures are expected to be confirmed next week with league fixtures out on June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united target aberdeen goalkeeper danny rogers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs their summer of signing continues, Dundee United could turn to Aberdeen goalkeeper Danny Rogers to help fill the gaps in their last line of defence.With Deniz Mehmet out long term and Harry Lewis back at Southampton, the Tangerines are on the hunt for two first-team goalies.And 24-year-old Rogers is one name on their list of possible additions.New York born and an American citizen, Rogers was capped nine times at U/21 level for the Republic of Ireland, for whom he qualifies through his Irish mother.He’s only played a handful of games for the Dons in six years at Pittodrie, but has over 100 top-team appearances under his belt during loan spells at Airdrie, Dumbarton and Falkirk.Most of those games came during a two-year spell with Falkirk between 2015 and 2017.He recently signed a two-year contract extension but could be available on loan again.Deniz, meanwhile, is now likely to have the operation to repair knee ligament damage next week.It was scheduled for early last week but the surgeon in England decided to delay it because the joint he damaged against Dunfermline in the play-offs last month remained swollen.He’s likely to be out until around the turn of the year.The Tangerines, meanwhile, have confirmed the signing of young Celtic defender Sam Wardrop and it’s understood Dunfermline’s Fraser Aird will be revealed as another member of the squad over the next few days.A deal for Wardrop was agreed with the Hoops last week and the 20-year-old joins on a two-year contract.The right-back has represented Scotland at U/15, U/16, U/17 and U/19 levels and captained Celtic’s Youth team to Scottish Cup victory in 2016.“Sam is an athletic and energetic defender who likes to get forward and attack the opposition.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

I’m excited, looking forward to it.”He also revealed he’d been persuaded to make the move north by new team-mate Roarie Deacon, with both players clients of OYS Sports Management along with Glen Kamara.Ralph added: “I’ve heard a lot of good things about the club.“I spoke to a few people as well, the likes of Roarie Deacon who said it’s a good place to come, play good football and the manager will improve me.“That’s pretty much everything I was looking for.“I am energetic, I like to attack.“I’m a left-back but I like to get forward as well.“I would say I’m decent in the air.“I like to try create when I can, I like getting assists.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Fraser-and-Roxanna-2.jpg ","title":"scotland fan into fourth decade of marriage with argentinean he fell in love with at 1978 world cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe 1978 World Cup ended in disappointment for Scotland, but for one fan it changed their life forever when he found love.Fraser MacKay was a successful small businessman in Edinburgh in the 1970s, running popular clothes shops, reports The Sunday Post.As a committed fan, the lure of being part of Ally’s Army was too great.“I had two or three mates I travelled with and we went to Thomas Cook to book up,” said Fraser, then 31, who is featured in a new BBC Scotland documentary being screened this week, Scotland ’78: A Love Story.“We all gathered in this café-bar Soracaban and I noticed this girl Roxanna.

A dismal 1-1 draw left Scotland clutching at straws just to stay in the tournament.And despite Archie Gemmill’s wonder goal against Holland, the 3-2 win wasn’t enough and the team were heading home.Fraser joined the rest of the demoralised fans returning, leaving on the same day Roxanna also went back to the family home.Back home in Scotland, Fraser couldn’t get Roxanna out of his mind.“I returned to Cordoba that December to spend some time with Roxanna and her family,” said Fraser, who is now retired.But it still took some time for the pair to know they were right for one another.“We fell out of touch for six years until she visited Europe with her sister and spent time with me.“She then went to Spain and a year later she came back for another visit.“It was then that we decided to get hitched having rediscovered our feelings for each other.”The lovestruck couple married in 1987, have been together ever since and have two sons, one 30, the other 29.Roxanna, 60, is a social carer.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent. The local government needs-based funding formula takes into account a number of factors such as rural and island communities, as well as road length and number of school pupils.\"A spokesman for the UK Treasury said: \"We\u0026rsquove helped make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved bodies in the world and they have a full range of tax powers to raise funds.\"Tuesday 5 Jun 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

But he didn’t know his way around Aberdeen so it was Jeff.”When Mr Taylor asked why the men changed drivers, Mr Clark replied: “Because he was unfamiliar with the area.”Mr Clark, of Aberdeen, told the court he had grown up in the same area in Aberdeen as Mr Stephen.Mr Clark said Keating and Summers came up to Aberdeen from Liverpool.The witness said the two Liverpudlians joined Binnie and another man, who cannot be named for legal reasons.Mr Clark said the four men started to plot Aitcher’s death at the home of his former partner.He said the men obtained a gun, a motorbike, tracksuits and mobile phones, which were all going to be used in the murder bid.Mr Clark said the plan involved using the motorbike to locate Aitcher.He said Keating would be riding as a pillion passenger and that he would shoot Aitcher before being driven away from the scene.He said: “They were going to find him and shoot him.”However, the court heard that the men’s plans were set back when the motorbike that was supposed to be used was stolen.Mr Clark also said the men told him and his former girlfriend about their plans to kill Aitcher.He added: “They told us. They weren’t exactly discreet about it.”Prosecutors claim the three men planned to murder Mr Stephen between May 1 2016 and November 24 2016 at a property in Aberdeen.Prosecutors allege they planned to murder Mr Stephen “in return for a payment of a sum of money”.It is claimed in “furtherance” of the “conspiracy”, the men acquired a Colt Model DA41 “six shot” revolver and three live .38 cartridges.They are also accused of firearms charges and a charge of possessing cannabis which are said to have taken place at different dates throughout 2016.Binnie is also accused of supplying cocaine and heroin.The Crown also claims on October 27 2016, Keating and Summers robbed a branch of Coral Bookmakers at Cornhill Shopping Arcade in Aberdeen.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

The earliest bike on display at Skipness dated from 1922 the latest was a saddle tank 1930s model.Nick Shelley from Nottingham, club secretary, explained: \u0026#8216The motorcycles were very characteristic and well made. Nearly all Sunbeams are painted black and originally had a gold leaf lining on the petrol tanks.\u0026#8216Sunbeams were described in early sales literature as \u0026#8216the most expensive\u0026#8217 bike you could buy, simply because it suggested superior quality.\u0026#8217The Scottish run is organised every two years by Chris Odling from Easdale, who said: \u0026#8216The weather just makes everything. Coming over the hills seeing Arran when we\u0026#8217ve just seen the Paps of Jura, taking your time on an old bike, is just wonderful.\u0026#8216The smokehouse opened for us today to give us soup and sandwiches when it is usually closed on a Saturday.

Was that a bird\u0026#8230or something else? Just what might we find beyond the paths?The reserve’s new art trail, though, dials up the magic a notch.Just by the entrance, Jane Walker’s straw deer of willow and scraps greet the viewer. Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me. I see it as secret and unexpected treasure \u0026#8211 underwater kelp forests and ocean meadows gracefully riding the ebb and flow of the tides.’The influences of nature brought into a new light makes for a mysterious experience that will stay with you far longer than the trail can last.The art trail at Taynish National Nature Reserve runs until Sunday September 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"wren kitchens open new store","story":"NewsWren Kitchens to open new store at Ayr retail parkThe firm will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:38, 30 MAY 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new tenant is to take up residence in Ayr’s out-of-town shopping park.

The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

visit of the president and first lady, Peter Mutharika and Gertrude Maseko \u0026ndash which was held in Edinburgh City Chambers.\nTeacher Shirley Bean, who is responsible for the group, said:

were officially welcomed by the deputy lord provost of Edinburgh, Councillor Joan Griffiths.\nThere were a number of speeches by different groups sharing their partnership experiences, including charities, agriculture, health and education groups.\nThe government was represented by MSP Fiona Hyslop, minister for foreign affairs and culture, and both she and President Mutharika took part in a question and answer session.\nBefore the end of the visit, two representatives from each school were invited to join the first lady and the President for a photograph.\nFreya Wilson and Joshua Inglis,

a child\u0027s life by sciving a lecture.\nAnthony Lenton and his classmates avoided an afternoon tutorial at Borders College to register with the Anthony Nolan Trust.\nAnd within a few months his genetic profile proved to be an identical match for a gravelly-ill toddler 150 miles away in Aberdeenshire.\nAnthony, who is now the co-manager of William Hill bookmaker\u0027s in Galashiels, told us: \"We all had a dull lecture to look forward to after lunch at the College when we saw a girl from the Anthony Nolan Trust looking for people to register.\n\"I had no knowledge of what the Anthony Noland Trust did but we decided to take our time filling in the forms so we didn\u0027t have to go to the lecture.\n\"Basically, sciving a lecture was the best decision I ever made.\"\nAt just 11 months old, Finn Mackin was diagnosed with a rare and dangerous form of leukaemia after a suspicious lump was found on one of his eyes.\nTumours developed and it was considered that chemotherapy was the Stonehaven toddler\u0027s only hope.\nBut several unsuccessful doses of treatment failed to cure him from cancer during a four-month stay at the Royal Aberdeen Children\u0026rsquos Hospital.\nAnd consultants decided the only remaining option of saving Finn\u0027s life was a high-risk stem cell transplant.\nDuring countrywide searches for donors, it was found that Anthony in Galashiels was the perfect match.\nThe youngster underwent a successful transplant at the end of 2015, followed by more than 50 blood transfusions, before eventually being declared cancer-free.\nFinn remains cancer-free and last week he was introduced to the sciving student who saved his life.\nAnthony added: \"It was really emotional meeting Finn.\n\"There is not allowed to be any contact for two years but then Anthony Noland passed on my number and Finn\u0027s mum made contact.\n\"It turned out I was a perfect match for Finn - a 12 out of 12, which could only be bettered if he had a twin.\n\"I have no idea how we are so genetically matched as I\u0027m originally from Cambridgeshire and Finn\u0027s family are all from around Aberdeen.\"\nStephen has now been invited to Finn\u0027s parents wedding next year.\nFinn\u0027s mum Siobhan said: \"Without Anthony, Finn wouldn\u0027t be here - as simple as that.\n\"We\u0026rsquoll be forever thankful.\"\nThe Anthony Noland Trust manages and recruits donors to a nationwide register to help match donors with cancer sufferers.\nThe charity also carries out research to help make bone marrow transplants more effective.\nAmy Bartlett from Anthony Nolan said: \"You could literally save somebody\u0027s life, as we\u0027ve seen happen with young Finn.\n\"I mean this story could have been so different, but for the generosity of a complete stranger.\"\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Bolton man accused of peeping Tom offence at caravan park showers","story":"A 44-year-old man has been charged under the Sexual Offences Act accused of watching

begin in the autumn, with the project on programme to open to learners by March 2020.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI would like to thank Scottish Borders Council for inviting

David Small, director of East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership, leaves at the end of June to take up a new appointment as director of Primary Care Transformation with NHS Lothian.  Mr Small began work in East Lothian in 2011 and undertook the setting up of East Lothian Health and Social Care Integration Shadow Board, which became the East Lothian Integration Joint Board (IJB) in July 2015.  He has also been instrumental in the delivering of the East Lothian Community Hospital in Haddington and has been involved in promoting faster access to primary care services with new systems introduced in Musselburg.  His new role will see Mr Small working with GPs, nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals to increase multi-disciplinary working as part of implementing the new GP contract and achieving better and quicker access to primary care for patients.  He said: \u0026ldquoI will miss East Lothian very much. Integrating health and social care is a big thing to take on board but I think our staff have responded incredibly well and made real changes to the way they work together and I appreciate their support.  \u0026lsquoWhoever takes up this post is taking on a very interesting and rewarding job.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.  Caroline Brown, acting depute headteacher at the Grammar, said that the relationship between the school and the VisitScotland five-star racecourse was proving fruitful for both pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.

Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been involved with the annual spectacle for a number of years and attended the second festival back in 1969.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are looking forward to it because it is 50 years.  \u0026ldquoI remember being at the second one and have lots of good memories and just had a lot of fun over the years.  \u0026ldquoIt is not easy pulling a programme together but, once the programme is set, you meet so many different people and it is really good.  \u0026ldquoWe have had some laughs along the way.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience.

Full of fun, mishaps and lively dance routines, the Roaring Twenties will be brought to life on stage over the next four evenings with a run of performances.  East Lothian group Encore was formed in 1993 after parents saw how much fun their children were having with local group Musical Youth and they wanted to join in. Musical Youth was set up in 1992 by Peter and Heather Antonelli to provide an outlet for the talent of local children. They are formerly from Prestonpans but now live in Gullane.  Playing the part of Millie is Alison Henry, from Prestonpans, who was in the first show with Musical Youth 25 years ago.

She won the school\u0026rsquos talent competition at the age of 10, performing Hallelujah.  Her teacher phoned her dad to say she thought Rebecca had a good voice and might benefit from lessons. This was duly done and she developed her skills with advice on breathing and holding notes from a coach.  She completed exams held by Trinity College London \u0026ndash the international exam board for the performing arts and English language.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The club are proud to be one of the best rated golf courses in the West of Scotland.

It\u0027s a joy to play and most of the time very quiet, allowing the visitor to relish the ups and downs of the fairways and the tussle with undulating greens. The arresting views across to the islands of Islay, Jura and Gigha provide a delightful backdrop on an idyllic summer\u0027s day with the firm Machrihanish turf underfoot, the majesty of the dunes and wheeling seabirds providing the musical sound track.  To provide a varied test for the competent golfer, the layout is not just a predictable nine out and nine back. The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee. Members can also enjoy complimentary use of the practise and putting areas.    The course ranks highly on a global scale. Golf Digest rated Machrihanish among the top 100 courses in the world in 2018, climbing 30 places to now rank 61st in the world. The club is also rated fourth best value for money within the UK.

The site\u0026rsquos Playful Garden, an entirely new feature which reflects the history of the castle in a family-friendly way, opened in April this year and is already proving extremely popular.  Thanks to the \u0026pound2.8 million project, visitor numbers over the last month have already more than doubled on the previous year.  More than 24,000 people have visited the castle since April 30, compared to just under 11,000 for same period in 2017/18.  The number of memberships for the site has also increased from 116 over the same period last year to 660 this year.  Simon Skinner, the trust\u0026rsquos chief executive, said the increase in footfall had \u0026ldquofar exceeded expectations.  The castle, located between Inverness and Aberdeen on the A96, was the ancient seat of the Clan Brodie from 1567 and was given to the care of the NTS in 1989.  Since then, the dilapidated building has gradually been brought back to life by the trust, with the latest upgrade proving to be the most successful yet.  Funding for the garden project was supported by a bequest from the family of wealthy Scottish lawyer and farmer George Anderson.  The new area features giant play equipment and landscaping for families to explore, as well as a quiet area for children with conditions such as autism.  It also features is a giant 6.5m rabbit sculpture.  Elsewhere, Newhailes House, near Musselburgh, has also seen a dramatic increase in visitors following \u0026pound2.4m of investment.

But Ash Pryce received an altogether different legacy - one which sparked a love of the supernatural and things that go bump in the night.  The magician will take to a Glasgow stage later this month with a show inspired by the tales of his Spiritualist grandfather Tom Lund, who introduced Ash to the occult when he was 11.  Spiritualism, which began as a movement in the 19th century, centres around a belief\u0026nbsp in the ability to communicate with the world of the spirits and receive messages from the afterlife.  And while Mr Pryce is not an active believer these days after his work on stage gave him a glimpse \u0027behind the curtain\u0027, his grandfather\u0027s tales of spooks, ghosts and missives from the world beyond have stayed with him to this day.    The illusionist\u0027s grandfather Tom Lund  Mr Pryce said: \"The show is very much a tribute to my grandfather. His room would be full of books on spirits, on ghosts, and we\u0026rsquod chat for hours about the\u0026nbsp other side. It was something that connected us.  \"When he died in 2014 I\u0026nbsp wanted to be able to pay tribute to him, and decided to draw on our\u0026nbsp mutual interest in Spiritualism.  \"I can honestly say that I wouldn\u0027t be a magician today if it wasn\u0027t for him.\"  Mr Pryce said that going to a spiritualist meeting with his grandfather at an early age made a huge impression on him, as the medium began to channel messages from a long-departed relative.  He said: \u0026ldquoI was in awe at what happened\u0026nbsp there.\u0026nbsp A table began bouncing around the room, the medium contacted my deceased great-grandmother\u0026hellip at least, that\u0026rsquos what it seemed.  \"My grandfather believed in it all and it gave me a life-long interest in the paranormal.\"  He later learned that the table was moved by people giving it tiny, reflexive nudges as they stood alongside - similar to the way a Ouija board works - while knocking sounds said to be spirits communicating were actually the sound of the mediums clicking their joints.  However, despite learning the tricks of the trade, he still remains fascinated in the supernatural.    Appearing at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Britannia Panopticon Music Hall - itself said to be haunted\u0026nbsp - the show will see the illusionist resurrect a 160-year-old illusion known as the Spirit Cabinet during a story-led performance based on his experiences with his grandfather.  The Spirit Cabinet was invented by American mediums the Davenport Brothers in the 1850s, and used a prop by mediums during their seances.  It sees a medium\u0026nbsp - in this case the actress Misha McCullagh - secured and bound inside a wooden or curtained box along with several small items, such as bells, writing tablets and occult symbols.  The medium would then challenge the spirits to \u0027cross the veil\u0027 into the material world and they would begin to move and interact with the items, writing messages for the audience to read or floating through the air.    Misha\u0026nbspMcCullagh, left, appears in the show  Mr Pryce,\u0026nbsp co-founder of the Edinburgh Horror Festival, said bringing the Spirit Cabinet to the stage was a fitting tribute to his grandfather\u0027s love of spiritualism.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been fascinated by the old-style seances, and when developing this show I wanted to recreate some of those elements.  |\"We have a unique take on the Victorian Spirit Cabinet which has been\u0026nbsp praised by magicians for its simplicity and effectiveness  \u0026ldquoIt was of course a very clever illusion, and one I had been keen for\u0026nbsp years to include  The show, titled Keep Calm and Scary On, also features mediumship readings, spirit writing, and several horror-themed demonstrations, all wrapped up in a very personal story of the magician and his grandfather.  It will be staged first at the Banshee Labyrinth in Edinburgh, part of the underground vaults that make up a large swath of the Old Town, before being brought to Glasgow on Saturday June 23rd.  Mr Pryce said: \u0026ldquoI think magic has the power to be very personal we\u0026rsquore seeing a lot of magic acts \u0026ndash especially on certain television talent shows \u0026ndash drawing on personal stories now, rather than just \u0026lsquopick a card, any card\u0026rsquo and those personal stories are what I think magic needs.

In a move to have\u0026nbspless sugar and more fruit and vegetables on school dinner menus, recommendations by experts to make school food and drink healthier are being consulted on by the Scottish Government.  Although strict rules already apply to the nutritional content of meals, drinks and snacks served in Scottish schools, following a review by health, nutrition and education experts, views are being sought on proposals to further reduce sugar and other measures to promote healthy choices and help tackle childhood obesity.  A list of proposals includes \"no\u0026nbsplonger permitting fruit juice and smoothies to be offered in primary and secondary schools\".    Another proposal involves\u0026nbspintroducing lower sugar limits, for foods such as breakfast cereal and yoghurts.  Ministers also want to reduce how often sweetened and baked goods are available in primary schools.  And they are also planning a new regulation for red meat which specifies, for the first time, how much of a child\u0026rsquos weekly intake should be high-quality produce and limits the amount of processed meat  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wants to cut child obesity by half by 2030.  Put sugar tax on smoothies, say doctors  Almost 30 percent of children in Scotland are at risk of being overweight, and 14 percent are at risk of being obese, according to government figures.  Scotland\u0027s Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \"More than 360,000 meals are dished up in Scottish schools every day, setting children and young people up for their lessons and -- through learning about healthy habits -- for life.  \"The proposals we are putting forward are based on the latest scientific and expert advice, as well as the views of local authorities, schools and catering staff.\"  In primary schools uptake of school lunches is the highest it has ever been due to the introduction of free school meals in Scotland in January 20.  Alison Johnstone, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo health spokesman said the recommenations\u0026nbspwon\u0026rsquot do anything to address pupils leaving at lunchtime to buy junk food.  She also said schools need better kitchen facilities so that fresh food can be prepared and cooked on site.  \u0026ldquoNew guidance on what is served in schools is welcome and providing three portions of fruit and vegetables at lunch time is a start, but when John Swinney began this review he said he wanted primary school children to have as many of their \u0027five a day\u0027 at school as they can,\" she said.  \u0026nbspIt\u0027s disappointing to see this is as far as efforts will go. It also won\u0026rsquot address the fact that in secondary schools most pupils leave at lunchtime, generally to buy junk food from nearby supermarkets, vans and takeaway shops.  \u0026ldquoLondon plans to ban new fast food outlets from opening near schools and we need equally strong action to tackle the obesogenic environment forced upon children and young people in Scotland. Nor is there anything in these proposals to improve facilities for preparing food in schools. Many schools lack kitchens and decent dining halls. We can hardly begin to change the food culture in our schools without investing in the production of healthy, fresh food, on site, and supporting catering staff properly.  \u0026ldquoExpanding the provision of free school meals simply must be a greater priority. It clearly increases uptake and is the best way to make school meals a foundation for healthy eating for all children.  \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Javid expresses  sympathy  to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland","story":"              THE prospects of a student nurse, originally from Africa, staying in Scotland to fulfil his dream of a career in the NHS appear to have risen after Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, said he was \u0026ldquovery sympathetic to his case.  Speaking at his first Commons question-time since taking over his new role, Mr Javid was questioned about the plight of 23-year-old Denzel Darku by the SNP\u0026rsquos Joanna Cherry.  The Edinburgh MP explained how the student nurse, who came to the UK from Ghana aged 14, was a tireless campaigner, who had carried the baton for Scotland in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.  Mr Darku previously served in the Scottish Youth Parliament and currently lives in Paisley. After having two appeals against deportation rejected, he is now battling to stay in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoHe dreams of a career in NHS Scotland but he faces deportation on a technicality through no fault of his own, declared Ms Cherry.  She referred to how the Scottish Government had written to the Secretary of State about Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case but had not yet had a reply and urged him to meet her to discuss it. \u0026ldquoHe only wants to stay in Scotland to serve the NHS, explained the backbencher.  Last week, Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case was raised at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions by Labour MSP Neil Bibby as another example of the UK Government\u0027s controversial \"hostile environment\" immigration policy. Nicola Sturgeon said the student nurse had been \"an absolute credit to Scotland\" and branded the threat of deportation hanging over him a \u0026ldquodisgrace.  The following day, The Herald understands, Ruth Davidson raised the case personally with the Home Secretary in a telephone call.  During Home Office Questions, Mr Javid said he was \u0026ldquopleased that Ms Cherry had raised the issue, noting how he had spoken about it to the Scottish Conservative leader, who, he said, was also \u0026ldquovery concerned.  He told MPs that there was an appeal going on in regards to Mr Darku\u0026rsquos case, so he could not say too much, but then added: \u0026ldquoI am very sympathetic about the situation.  A source close to Ms Davidson said she was \u0026ldquovery pleased by Mr Javid\u0026rsquos comments.  Later, Ms Cherry said the student nurse\u0026rsquos situation was another illustration of the impact of the Government\u0026rsquos immigration policies, which were \u0026ldquodamaging and callous and that Scotland wanted \u0026ldquonothing to do with them.  She went on: \u0026ldquoThis young man is studying hard so he can become a nurse and work in our NHS yet he faces deportation. All this at a time when Theresa May is resisting calls to see sense from even her own Cabinet colleagues and allow skilled migration of health care workers to the UK.  The SNP\u0026rsquos home affairs spokeswoman argued that the Conservative Government was failing the country\u0026rsquos economy and society and that it was \u0026ldquoappalling it had not even had the courtesy to reply to letters from the Scottish Government, which was \u0026ldquochampioning Denzel\u0026rsquos case.  Ms Cherry said a \u0026ldquoScotland-specific migration system would the nation to prioritise what its economy and society needed \u0026ldquorather than having to abide by Tory plans to cut net migration, which we now know will cost our economy \u0026pound10 billion a year  She added: \u0026ldquoAs we move closer to Brexit, we need the UK Government to do more than simply drop their net migration targets we need migration levels to be maintained, if not increased. In Scotland our demographic requirements mean immigration needs to be encouraged.  \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoWe need powers over migration to come to Scotland we want nothing to do with the Tories\u0026rsquo hostile environment regime.

It might not be Wembley but Broadwood Stadium is a mighty fine start. The accompanying photograph showed the six-piece band on the stage, their arms around each other.  It turns out that this was not only M\u0026agravenran\u0026rsquos first stadium show, it was the stadium\u0026rsquos first show, as well. For one night only, the Cumbernauld venue, home to Clyde FC for the last 28 years, was turned into an outdoor music gig. Broadwood: Live by the Loch, it was called. There were three acts: Dougie MacLean was the opener, followed by M\u0026agravenran and then, shortly after nine o\u0026rsquoclock, after an hour or so of steady rain, the headliners, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers. L\u0026agraven Chomais, a Gaelic rock/traditional band from the local Greenfaulds High School, also played a couple of sets.  By the end of the night - 11pm, or thereabouts - MacLean, M\u0026agravenran and the Pipers had done a mass version of MacLean\u0026rsquos anthem, Caledonia, and the 2,000 fans went home happy. Those who had patiently stood in front of the stage, rather than sitting in the covered stands, had got the worst of the rain, but didn\u0026rsquot seem to mind too much. And within moments the organisers, North Lanarkshire Leisure, were tweeting that the event would return next year, \u0026ldquoeven bigger and better.  Could this be the start of something for Cumbernauld? The aim is that Broadwood will now go on to host further high-profile concerts. It has been tried nearby: Falkirk FC\u0026rsquos stadium has seen concerts by Elton John, Status Quo and Tom Jones, amongst others, while Elton played Airdrie FC\u0026rsquos Excelsior Stadium a year ago this month. As an academic, Dr Stephen Bowman, wrote approvingly on Twitter: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to do down #Cumbernauld but full credit to everyone associated with #LivebytheLoch ... Exactly the sort of the kind of thing the town needs and deserves.  The stadium was effectively divided in two for the show, one half remaining cordoned off while the other half was given over to the staging, lighting and PA system, the standing fans and the food stalls. The leisure centre at one end of Broadwood had become a hospitality centre, with communal changing rooms being turned into dressing-rooms for the musicians.  \u0026ldquoThis all goes back to a Facebook message I got at the back end of January from Gerry McMahon at NL Leisure, said Gary Innes, accordionist with M\u0026agravenran, in a dressing-room strewn with clothes and musical instruments. \u0026ldquoHe said, look, we\u0026rsquove got the Gaelic school out here, and we want to put on a music event but we don\u0026rsquot know who to speak to or what to do, could you come out here for a meeting?  So Innes met them, and they told him that what they wanted to do was to stage a music festival. He drew on his contacts in the industry, assembled a bill, went back to NL Leisure and got it approved. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove got a great team and they have worked their socks off to get the stadium, he said. \u0026ldquoBut when you think about it, the show was signed off only in March, and the turnaround since then has been quite remarkable. A lot of hard work has gone into this.  \u0026ldquoNL Leisure asked if we could give them acts that could sell tickets, bring in the numbers. We knew Dougie was celebrating 40 years of Caledonia and, national treasure that he is, he was an easy fit. The Pipers have a worldwide appeal. Two of them lived in Cumbernauld for many years, so they feel this is kind of a homecoming gig. It\u0026rsquos also part of their 15-year celebration of the band.  \u0026ldquoThe nice thing that NL Leisure is really keen on is building on that local connection with the community and giving them something that they can look forward to and be part of, Innes adds. \u0026ldquoThey acknowledge that there\u0026rsquos not an awful lot here [in cultural terms]. In terms of a sports facility it\u0026rsquos brilliant but outwith that there\u0026rsquos not an awful lot for the community to do, so if they can add to that each year by putting on a musical event, then it\u0026rsquos great for the community and the stadium. \u0026ldquo  \u0026ldquoThis is a really heavily populated bit of the country, adds his colleague Ewen Henderson, \u0026ldquoand a lot of it are families, and young families, who are quite often cut out of a lot of the cultural spectrum in terms of being able to go to events. Innes added that NL Leisure was already looking forward to next year and trying to get a big headliner in, backed by a solid 10 months of pre-publicity.  Kevin MacDonald is one of the three bagpipers in the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, who fuse trad Scots music with such rock and pop hits as Queen\u0026rsquos We Will Rock You and Snow Patrol\u0026rsquos Chasing Cars (\u0026ldquobagrock, they call it), and who play 200 shows every year. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove known Gary for a number of years and he asked us if we could be on the second of June, he says. \u0026ldquoWe were meant to be in Germany today but the event was cancelled, so it has worked out great for us.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also quite nice in that both [piper] Willie [Armstrong] and I, the two founding members, both lived in Cumbernauld. I went to Greenfaulds High School and that\u0026rsquos where I met Willie. He still stays here.  \u0026ldquoThe biggest thing on a personal side that I\u0026rsquove noticed about Cumbernauld, because I came from a small community in Aberdeen before coming down here, is that, unfortunately, it suffers from a lack of different communities, because it\u0026rsquos seen as a commuter town between Edinburgh and Glasgow. Even when I was growing up here, if you wanted a night out you went to Glasgow or you went to Edinburgh. Unfortunately it has never built up a proper community-type spirit where people can come along. Clyde have been in the football stadium here some 24, 25 years ago and it\u0026rsquos great to see that NLL is now trying to bring events [like the concert] here.  Rain had been threatening for a couple of hours before the show. The atmosphere is muggy, and the crowd is still in the process of arriving, when L\u0026agraven Chomais open proceedings. Dougie MacLean, who has travelled with his wife Jenny from Perthshire to be here, plays songs old and new, and gets the audience going as he has been doing for years now. He teasingly alludes to, but doesn\u0026rsquot actually name, what is probably his best-known song. That, it seems, is for later.  M\u0026agravenran play an engaging, boisterous set and win a lot of new fans in the process. Gary Innes, who has put the bill together, and who won the Instrumentalist of the Year title at last December\u0026rsquos Scots Trad Music Awards, suffers a mishap, however, for the first time in his professional career: he raises his arms, and his accordion strap breaks. He has to disappear for a few minutes to borrow an accordion from L\u0026agraven Chomais.  The food and drink stalls have been doing solid business throughout the night, and finally it\u0026rsquos the turn of the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, complete with their energetic dancers, Rachel and Eilidh. Amazing Grace is one of their early songs but it\u0026rsquos the rock covers that really get the fans dancing, some of them managing to dance as they clutch umbrellas and pints of beer. And at some point during the set, Clare Adamson, the SNP MSP for Motherwell \u0026amp Wishaw, who is present, spots a \u0026ldquovery young lady in the act of flossing. \u0026ldquoRespect, she tweets.  Back in the M\u0026agravenran dressing-room, bottles of wine have been opened, and the general opinion is that the night has gone rather well. Kevin Rodgers, a Gaelic teacher at Greenfaulds had earlier spoken of his delight at how L\u0026agraven Chomais\u0026rsquos sets have gone. The teenagers - Craig Yule, Ava MacKinnon, Jessica Muir and Emily Robertson (a fifth, Eilidh Millar, was unable to make it) - were, he said, \u0026ldquoall as high as kites, absolutely. It\u0026rsquos been a brilliant experience, ever since they came here for a soundcheck at four o\u0026rsquoclock.  Outside again: darkness has fallen, and the kilted Pipers are bringing their set to a close. It\u0026rsquos been a good one: you can see why they\u0026rsquove played sell-out tours across the world, and why their fans include Ewan McGregor, Sir Paul McCartney, the Scottish rugby team, the Queen and Samuel L Jackson, to quote from the band\u0026rsquos website. And then, as a final act, all the musicians crowd onto the stage to sing Caledonia, the audience lustily singing along.  Graeme Morrison, operations and business development manager at NL Leisure, and one of the event organisers, said the concert had been delivered over a relatively short timescale, compared to the time it would normally take to organise and promoting an event of this size. \u0026ldquoWhile the day itself was very long, it was incredibly rewarding and exhilarating to see so many people enjoying the show. We\u0026rsquore already talking about next year. We feel we\u0026rsquore in a privileged position to be able to put something like this on for the community. Because everybody praised it so much, despite the bad weather, we owe the audience and the community this, to put it on again next year. We\u0026rsquore open to working in partnership with big promoters, but what we\u0026rsquove absolutely demonstrated with Saturday is we\u0026rsquore capable of putting on our own events.  \u0026ldquoThis is a legacy event for us, he added. \u0026ldquoI want people to be talking about Broadwood: Live by the Loch in twenty years\u0026rsquo time."},{"url":null,"title":"Ken Smith  39 s diary  Driven demented  In the soup  Took a pounding","story":"              Driven demented  A SOUTH side reader who returned from a shopping trip to Silverburn tells us: \"I didn\u0027t know who to feel more sorry for - myself for not being able to remember where I parked my car, or the driver slowly following me through the car park hoping to get my space.\"  In the soup  GOOD news!

But thanks to the work of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), many of the country\u0026rsquos key sites are being given a new lease of life.  NTS this week announced an ambitious five-year plan, detailing a \u0026pound60 million commitment to Scotland\u0026rsquos built and natural heritage.  The charity hopes the investment will not only attract more visitors to its sites, but also encourage more Scots to become members of the trust.  NTS chief executive Simon Skinner said: \u0026ldquoThis strategy outlines everything that the National Trust for Scotland stands for - protecting our heritage, sharing unique experiences with people and promoting Scotland, all through the collective endeavour of our supporters and staff.  He added that as part of the strategy, the key message to Scots is: \u0026ldquoWe need your help if we\u0026rsquore going to keep doing the things that you like and looking after the things that you love.  One of the biggest projects included in the plan is the conservation of Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos Hill House in Helensburgh.  The crumbling landmark was built as a \u0026ldquohome for the future in 1902 but the experimental building material has allowed water to soak into the building.  The trust is spending \u0026pound5m on the world-leading project, which will begin later this year.  \u0026ldquoThis is a pure conservation exercise, said Mr Skinner. \u0026ldquoThe cage will keep the rain out but allow the wind to blow through and hopefully dry the building out.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore essentially buying time until we can come up with a solution for the building.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time anything like this has been done anywhere in the world. Other countries are looking to Scotland to see if this works, so it\u0026rsquos very significant conservation project.  The cage will also include gangways allowing the public to view the building and the ongoing restoration work.  Elsewhere in Scotland, Glencoe is also set to benefit from \u0026pound1.1m of investment.  This will include an upgrade to access roads and the site\u0026rsquos visitor centre, which Mr Skinner describes as a \u0026ldquolost opportunity.  He said: \u0026ldquoMany people don\u0026rsquot realise that the landscape you see wouldn\u0026rsquot quite be the same if you didn\u0026rsquot have us looking after it.  \u0026ldquoWe maintain the access roads and look after the visitor centre and all that comes at a cost.  \u0026ldquoMany people simply pass by the visitor centre and that\u0026rsquos a lost opportunity to engage around one million people each year.  Just a little further along the road, another important site - the Glenfinnan Monument - is also in need of some attention.  The monument, at the head of Loch Shiel, pays tribute to Bonnie Prince Charlie and those who fought in the Jacobite Risings.  Built in 1815, the 18m-high building is now overshadowed by a more modern tourist attraction - the Glenfinnan viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter film franchise.  The site\u0026rsquos visitor centre will receive a \u0026pound250,000 upgrade in a bid, as Mr Skinner says, to \u0026ldquogive the Harry Potter fans a reason to turn around.  Inverewe Garden and Estate in Wester Ross will also receive a \u0026pound700,000 boost under the strategy.  It ha s already received \u0026pound2.5m for a new glasshouse to display rare and exotic plants, and to enable Inverewe House to be open to the public for the first time, and the next stage of investment will involve the creation of an access tower linking the gardens and viewpoint over Loch Ewe.  The House of Dun, in Montrose, will also receive a \u0026pound800,000 upgrade, while other sites to benefit also include the Burns Monument in Ayrshire and Alexander \u0026ldquoGreek Thomson\u0026rsquos unique interiors at Holmwood in Cathcart.  The number of visitors to NTS properties began a long decline in the 1990s and early 2000s.  In 2005/06 visitor numbers sat at 1.45m, but by 2014/15 had dropped by 24 per cent to 1.1m.  However, the situation has began to improve over the last three years, with the latest figures showing total visitors numbers sitting at 3.69m for 2017/18.  The trust hopes that its new strategy will allow it to further build on that and encourage more people to experience the best of Scotland\u0026rsquos built and natural heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic-themed wedding goes viral","story":"              A CELTIC-MAD bridegroom\u0026nbspmade sure that when he came to tie the knot, it would have a definite Hoops theme.

The company, led by artistic director Angus Farquhar, said it is also to abandon its plans to rescue the ruined modernist building St Peter\u0027s Seminary, in Cardross, throwing its future again into question.  The news comes six months after NVA lost out in the recent Regular Funding round by Creative Scotland, where it was not granted the core funding it desired.  In a statement, the board of NVA - which has for 25 years produced works of art often involving landscape, music and light - said it is to close.  Its works include the Hidden Gardens at the Tramway in Glasgow, The Secret Sign in Finnich Glen, a show in Central Hotel in 1999, Grand Central, and The Path in Glen Lyon in 2000.  It also staged The Storr: Unfolding Landscapes on the Isle of Skye in 2005 and Speed of Light, initially commissioned as part of the UK\u0026rsquos 2012 Cultural Olympiad.  The statement says: \"In September of last year the trustees of NVA made the difficult decision to withdraw from the capital project plans to rescue St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary in Cardross, due to increasing risks, both financial and physical.  \"NVA\u0026rsquos original plan for St Peter\u0026rsquos was universally acknowledged as bold, with creative ambition at its heart.  \"It was also recognised as a high risk venture for a small independent arts organisation.  \"NVA has spent many years working with great passion and determination, with the support of the owners of the site, the Archdiocese of Glasgow, to save this iconic building for future generations.  \"We collaborated with public and private stakeholders, the local communities and an amazing design team.  \"Important work was done to begin to preserve and restore the building and to demonstrate the immense creative, intellectual and community potential of the site.\"  However, it adds: \"Despite our best efforts we were unable to guarantee the viable future for the St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary that we had imagined and hoped for. In the end, we had no choice but to bring the capital project to an end.\"  NVA said it has tried to develop an \"alternative proposal\" for the site, but this has not proved possible and \"has reinforced the many financial and structural challenges facing the company.\"  The board said that NVA is now \"not able to continue\".  NVA\u0026rsquos final presentation will take place this summer in a co-production with Hopscotch Films working with the acclaimed Scottish artist Rachel Maclean.  Make Me Up, a commission from BBC Arts and 14-18 NOW, the UK\u0026rsquos official arts programme for the First World War centenary celebrations, will reflect on the shortcomings of a century of female enfranchisement."}]
