The event takes its name from the 1976 comedy movie The Gumball Rally and raises funds for youth projects.Cooper also reportedly chose the term ‘Gumball’ to describe the rally because iconic artist Andy Warhol used it to describe the way that the population chews up and eventually spits out pop culture like gum.The inaugural rally, in which Cooper and about 50 of his friends participated, took place between London and Rimini, Italy, passing through cities like Paris along the way.The 2001 rally, which stretched between London and Berlin, Germany, is often seen as a turning point for the race as its popularity and global awareness rose sharply around that time.In 2002, the rally moved from Europe to the United States, starting in New York City and ending in Los Angeles, California, passing iconic landmarks like the White House in Washington, D.C. and the Grand Canyon in Arizona along the way.In 2004, the race returned to Europe, taking place between Paris and Cannes, France. Sadly, the 2007 rally ended early after a traffic accident in Macedonia resulted in the deaths of two nonparticipants.The 2008 and 2009 rallies were held entirely in the United States while the 2010 rally was notably the first transatlantic race as participants were flown between Europe and the U.S. The 2014 and 2015 rallies also featured a similar transatlantic route, flying participants between Miami, Florida and Ibiza, Spain in 2014 and Stockholm, Sweden and Las Vegas in 2015.When is the 2018 Gumball 3000 Rally?The rally is set to begin on Saturday, August 4 and continue until Sunday, August 12.2018 Gumball 3000 Rally trophyTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the rally, Asprey has made a new ‘Spirit of Gumball’ trophy to mark the event. Modelled after a vintage gumball machine, it will be revealed to the public at the rally’s official launch party in London.Asprey Chairman John Rigas expressed enthusiasm at being part of the celebrity motor rally, stating: ‘We are delighted to host Gumball at the Asprey Mayfair flagship and thrilled to join the Gumball 3000 rally. It is a very exciting route this year through beautiful parts of Europe and continuing through important cities in Japan, one of the most beautiful countries in the world.’Meghan Markle\u0027s birthday wish every year is inspired by her motherCulture Club tour 2018: All you need to know about the UK datesGreat British Bake Off 2018: Start date, judges, trailer and more revealedGumball 3000 Rally 2018: All you need to know about the 20th anniversary race from London to TokyoGame of Thrones star Maisie Williams launches Daisie appPrince Harry and Meghan Markle told friends \u0027if you talk to the press you\u0027re out\u0027Station 19 season 2: All you need to know about the Grey\u0027s Anatomy spin-offStephen Colbert slams Ivanka Trump on The Late Show asking \u0027what do you do?\u0027Could Love Island be axed because of Brexit? Fortnite\u0027s Week 4 challenges: Search between a gas station, soccer pitch and Stunt MountainFA Community Shield 2018 - Chelsea vs Manchester City: When is it and what TV channel is it on?As Jennifer Aniston and Kim Kardashian reveal their weight, here\u0027s what your favorite celebs weigh Who is Gul Panag?

And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.\u0027So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself. I want you to challenge yourself.\u0027I want you to stop gossiping, to try a food that scares you, to buy a coffee for someone just because, to tell someone you love them…and then to tell yourself right back. I want you to find your happiness.\u0027Markle used her blog as a platform to express her feelings about her personal life and past experiences growing up as well.

My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls.\u0027Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So every day during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and 1pm, I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone,’ she wrote.For her birthday, Markle is reportedly planning to celebrate in Surrey at the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee, one of Prince Harry’s best friends who also served as an usher at the Royal Wedding.Per Royal tradition, birthdays are usually low-key affairs celebrated at home.

Clean and crisp with a decent junipery kick to it. Great value, no-nonsense gin. 710Gordon’s Special Dry London Gin 70cl, £14.50, TescoIt’s got a smoother aroma with a more rounded, fruity character. Gordon’s is the slightly better gin, even once tonic water is added — but is it worth paying an extra £4.50 for? I’m not sure. 810  Renowned puritan Oliver Cromwell will be delighted a new gin named after him provides good value for money when compared to the flashy famous brandRums with punch Old Hopking Premium White Rum 70cl, £9.99, AldiIt’s hard to get past the fiery aroma when sniffed neat — but there’s a creamy vanilla flavour. Once mixed, it does the job just fine. 510Bacardi Carta Blanca Rum 1l, £19.50, TescoVery light, slightly floral-smelling with a whiff of vanilla. It’s smooth with a gentle aftertaste. All round, a better taste. 810  Old Hopking premium white rum might be almost a tenner cheaper than Bacardi, but it tastes it as well Coconut craze Coconut Cove 70cl, £4.29, LidlThis is billed as a Caribbean-style drink with coconut and rum flavours, but it really tastes of old suncream. Not even a cocktail umbrella can perk this up. 110Malibu Caribbean Rum 70cl, £15, TescoDangerously appealing with soft, sweet coconut aromas and flavours, this rum is much better than the cheaper alternative, even when it is mixed with fruit juice. It would therefore make a delightful cocktail.710  Coconut Cove, left, tastes like old sunscreen - so stick to the Malibu, rightLookalike liquor Premium Cream Sherry 75cl, £5.29, AldiThis sherry has lovely smooth, rich nutty aromas with a gorgeous texture on the palate. It’s full of tasty raisin and caramel flavours, making it feel truly luxurious. Hands up, this is a true guilty pleasure. 910Harveys Bristol Cream 75cl, £10, TescoClassic cream sherry aromas — think mixed nuts and raisins. Nice enough, but it’s just not quite as impressive as the nearly half-price, copycat equivalent.610  Caversham\u0027s cream sherry is almost half the price of Harvey\u0027s and tastes betterCopycat cognac Chevalier Cognac VS 70cl, £14.99, AldiA bit too rough around the edges, this brings tears to the eyes — and not in a good way. It might be better off used in this year’s Christmas cake rather than sipped alone or served at a party.310Courvoisier Cognac VS 70cl, £27.50, OcadoThe label ‘VS’ means it’s been aged in oak casks for at least a couple of years, and this has some lovely oaky notes to it, along with spirit, dried fruits and spice. All in all, this is definitely worth the extra money. 810  If you want to bring tears to your guests\u0027 eyes, try Chevalier, left, otherwise stick to CourvoisierCool as cucumbers Harrison’s Gin 70cl, £15.99, AldiAldi’s new cucumber gin, in its dark bottle, looks very much like another handcrafted cucumber gin, which has a name that also begins with an H. However, strangely, this version tastes a lot more like parma violets than cucumber. But altogether it’s a good, clean, lighter-style gin at a reasonable price. 710Hendrick’s Gin 70cl, £28, TescoThis gin is smoother than the Harrison’s, and has more of a fruity character. It’s certainly well-balanced, too. However, if I’m being honest, once again I struggle to find the cucumber in there. And it’s almost twice the price of the Aldi version. My advice: buy the cheaper one, and spend the difference on a nice tonic for a great G\u0026ampT. 610  Harrison\u0027s Gin, left, is very good and at £15.99 is better value than Hendricks at £28Vodka wars Rachmaninoff Triple Distilled Vodka 70cl, £9.99, LidlThis has a neutral nose, bar the fiery sensation, as you might expect. It feels a bit quick and dirty on its own, but once some tonic is added it works pretty well. 510Smirnoff Red Label Vodka 70cl, £14.50, TescoThere is a more peppery smell compared with the other red label vodka. And on the palate it’s definitely smoother, with an almost creamy texture. 810  There\u0027s no symphony for this Rachmaninoff, so stick with the tried and tested Smirnoff, rightCreamy cousinsBallycastle Irish Country Cream 70cl, £3.75, AldiReally thick and creamy, it’s almost too cloying in the mouth — think melted alcoholic ice cream. However, the taste is reassuringly sweet and a little chocolatey. 510Baileys Original Irish Cream Liqueur 70cl, £15, TescoThe aroma isn’t as appealing as the cheaper lookalike, but it’s got more alcohol and flavour to it. It’s also not quite so thick or creamy and, to my eyes, not worth the extra money. 510  There isn\u0027t a great deal to chose between these milk-based alcoholic liqueurs from IrelandWhisky galore Queen Margot 3-Year Blended Scotch Whisky 70cl, £11.49, LidlThis is very light, with caramel and orange flavours. It’s a crowdpleaser — but weightier whisky aficionados might wish to pass. 710Bell’s Original Whisky 70cl, £15, TescoThis is pretty peaty on the nose with a fair whack of smoke on the palate.

It’s a bit thin on the palate, too, even when mixed with prosecco, soda and ice. 510Aperol 70cl, £15, OcadoDefinitely the superior aperitif of the two, with a more fresh, tangy orange fruit smell and taste. Brighter in every sense. 910  Here, the supermarket version will deliver half the taste for half the costFruit cup final Austin’s Summer Punch 1l, £5.99, AldiThis smells more like a nail salon than Pimm’s . It’s thin on flavour, too, with scant summer fruit. Not great. 210Pimm’s No 1 Cup 70cl, £15, OcadoSlightly darker in colour with a touch of spice and caramel on the nose, this has a richer palate with more weight.

Pit accidents were common I remember him saying how often they’d hear the siren, warning of an accident. And when he was seven, that siren rang for his father Joe, who was killed in a collapse.His mother remarried soon after and the family moved south, to Coventry. But their new stepfather was a violent man. By the age of 13, Dad felt he had to leave home. He told me he felt he might have killed his stepfather if he’d stayed.Taking his younger brother with him, Dad moved back to Scotland to live with their uncle, and found work in the local pit. It was the start of World War II and mining was a protected industry, so he was never called up to fight.After the war, Dad worked as a waiter at Butlins Holiday Camp at Filey in Yorkshire, and later at another camp at Portelet Bay, Jersey — which is where, in 1949, he met my mother Olive, then 19. It was love at first sight for them both.Dad moved to London to find work and to be near Olive, and they married in 1952, settling in Hounslow. At Mum’s suggestion, he began to study maths and engineering at night school, so he could find work as a tooling engineer.She also encouraged him to join her ballroom dancing lessons, which became a lifelong shared passion. They were a fixture in the world of ballroom and knew Len Goodman, the former Strictly judge.

His credo was fairness in the workplace he was already a member of the Labour Party when he met Mum and was becoming increasingly interested in local government.That passion led him to be elected to the local council, and he was even invited to stand as an MP for Feltham and Heston in the Seventies, but declined, fearing too much time away from the family.Dad felt that his role was to make life better on a local level. So when he was told to sign an eviction notice for an overcrowded property in Chiswick — Britain’s first home for battered wives, founded by Erin Pizzey — he refused.He was warned he might be prosecuted and go to prison, but Dad knew what life was like in a violent home and he stood firm, appearing on Thames Television’s Today programme to explain how important these sanctuaries were.He remained a friend of the Chiswick Women’s Aid movement, now known as Refuge, all his life. When the charity celebrated its 45th anniversary at the House of Lords in 2017, Dad and Mum were invited.Dad’s career in local government flourished and in 1978, he and Mum were selected as Mayor and Mayoress of Hounslow.His family, though, was the centre of his life and he was a loving father to my elder brother Kerry and me, and adoring grandfather to his four grandchildren.Dad and Mum retired to Windlesham in Surrey, where they continued to dance. When Mum developed dementia, Dad was happy to be her carer. He always credited her with ‘saving his life’ by encouraging him to study and better himself.Dad’s death was unexpected, following a routine heart operation. The day before he died, he and Mum had spent a lovely afternoon reminiscing. He was a gentleman to the last, who thrived on others’ happiness.James (Jim) Duffy, born May 16, 1926, died June 13, 2018, aged 92.  Stumped by the crossword? Blame my brilliant friend! MY COLLEAGUE NUALAby Richard ColferIf you find yourself scratching your head over the Giant Crossword on page 62 of today’s Mail, I hope you’ll spare a thought for Nuala. For the past 25 years she has been compiling that puzzle every Saturday, a run that will only come to an end in December when the final one, her 1,248th, which she completed before her death at the age of 90 last month, will be published.It all started 72 years ago. Shortly after the war, Nuala was working as an air hostess when she met Brian Considine, a pilot from Limerick who had been wounded in the Battle of Britain.Brian introduced her to cryptic crosswords and they subsequently compiled one together. To their joy and surprise, it was published by the Irish News when Nuala was still just 18.In the more than seven decades since, she is thought to have compiled more crosswords than anyone else in history.She was born Aisling Fionnuala Maire Kiernan on October 10, 1927, in London, the second of four children of Delia Kiernan, a noted Irish folk singer, and Dr Thomas J. Kiernan, a diplomat and later Ireland’s ambassador to West Germany and the U.S.          Nuala Considine is thought to have compiled more crosswords than anyone else in history. Notably shunning the use of computers — she preferred instead to design grids by hand to go alongside the neat, witty clues that were her hallmarkShe married Brian in 1948 and joined the press and puzzles agency Morley Adams Ltd (now part of the Press Association) in Fleet Street in 1955, where she worked for the rest of her life.In that time she compiled crosswords for a range of newspapers including the Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph and Daily Express (for some years setting all their daily cryptics single-handed).Once, when she was compiling a crossword called ‘The Stinker’ for the Weekend Mail, a group of people who used to try to tackle it together became so frustrated that they wrote to the paper asking for a photograph of the setter to put on their dartboard. The request was politely refused.She and Brian never had children and after his death in 1996 she carried on compiling, notably shunning the use of computers — she preferred instead to design grids by hand to go alongside the neat, witty clues that were her hallmark.I will remember her as a kind woman, ready with encouraging words and helpful advice, who loved splitting her time between Britain and her second home in San Diego.Even in her 80s she remained fit and active, showing amazing speed in providing a cup of tea and a slice of cake for guests, zipping up and down her stairs with ease.To hear that she had been diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer was an enormous shock, but Nuala accepted it with great dignity.Her funeral in London on Friday, July 27, was attended by many family members and friends, from crosswords and beyond, who couldn’t resist swapping stories in the pub afterwards.All I can say is that if her story has inspired you to try her crossword, please do! You won’t find a better one.Nuala Considine, born October 10, 1927, died July 24, 2018, aged 90.  Aaron\u0027s smile was a tonic for all who met him MY SON AARONby John MollittWhenever I think of my son Aaron, it’s his huge smile that comes to mind first. He was such a happy person — yet so disabled that he couldn’t even say hello.But Aaron had a way with him. Pushing him in his wheelchair through our tiny village of Ingleton in the Yorkshire Dales could take a couple of hours because everyone wanted to stop and see how he was.And that wonderful smile was such a tonic that I often took him with me when I visited hospitals in my role as a minister of Ingleton Evangelical Church. His presence seemed to be uplifting for others.The great tragedy was that when Aaron was born in August 1987, he was a healthy baby. His multiple disorders — spastic quadriplegia, epilepsy, severe spinal curvature and visual impairment — were caused when he was just four weeks old, by his violent biological father, a heroin addict.My wife Pat and I fostered him, intending to keep him for a year. We had two children and had fostered babies before. But Aaron had such profound needs that he became a full-time job for my wife.          Aaron Mollitt had profound disabilities, but his pleasures were simple. He loved being pushed in his wheelchair, to breathe fresh air and feel the breeze on his faceAnd somehow he became family, and our fostering role just kept going until, in 2004, when Aaron was 16, we adopted him.Of course, doctors warned us that Aaron’s health was not compatible with a long life. He had repeated chest infections and often needed hospital treatment. But Aaron was a fighter and kept defying the odds.He attended a special school in Carnforth until he was 18 and was very happy there. After he left, I took early retirement and we spent another happy decade together — he became a familiar figure at churches I visited, football and cricket matches, brass band concerts — in fact, everywhere we went.Great kindness was shown to us because of Aaron. One afternoon, we were having coffee and scones in a cafe but when we went to settle the bill, we were told the staff had had a whip-round and there was nothing to pay.When Aaron finally succumbed to a chest infection, the family was devastated.For someone with such profound disabilities, his pleasures were simple. He loved being pushed in his wheelchair, to breathe fresh air and feel the breeze on his face.And that’s how we remember him now, with an annual family walk up Ingleborough peak. We miss Aaron every day but we are so thankful for the years we spent with him.Aaron Luke Mollitt, born August 30, 1987, died May 18, 2016, aged 28.  Our \u0027Magic Mary\u0027 made crazy ideas come true MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW MARY MCDOWELLby Oenone McDowellEveryone knew my daughter-in-law as ‘Magic Mary’ because she could conjure up miracles out of thin air. She just had that knack of making the craziest ideas a reality.And the best example of that was when she and her friend Claire organised a huge fundraising event called the Pink Tie Ball for charity. They persuaded Sittingbourne Golf Club to host it free, then arranged wonderful auction prizes, including a VIP box at the Manchester United football ground. They raised more than £9,000 for the Medway Maritime Hospital.Sadly, the only magic trick Mary couldn’t pull off was beating breast cancer, although for ten years she gave it everything she had.Mary was born in Gillingham, Kent, the only girl in a family of seven and perhaps that’s why she grew up sports-mad, especially football (Gillingham FC) and playing netball and badminton.          Everyone knew my daughter-in-law Mary McDowell, pictured here with husband Rob, as ‘Magic Mary’ because she could conjure up miracles out of thin air She met my son Rob and there was a special bond between us from the start. I even made her wedding dress — a fashionable, bouffant affair (pictured).They went on to have two children, Samantha, born in 1988, and Ben, two years later. To celebrate, Rob bought her a gold necklace from a local jeweller. To their shock and delight, it turned out to be one that had been stolen from her in a burglary a year or two before.With her own children at school, Mary trained as a teaching assistant. She had left with few exam passes herself, but was in her element helping others.As a family, they loved camping and caravanning, taking their children to festivals and open-air concerts all over the country. At home, they hosted wonderful barbecues for the family. It seemed a charmed life to all of us.So when Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, it was devastating news. But she was typically upbeat, although realistic: ‘I know this thing is going to get me,’ she said to me once, ‘but not yet.’Mary McDowell, born March 18, 1960, died January 27, 2018, aged 57. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/04/4ECF35F700000578-6025533-image-m-25_1533352960473.jpg","title":"Samantha Markle wishes half sister Meg happy birthday","story":"    Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha wished the duchess a happy birthday just before midnight Friday - alongside a reminder to send a belated birthday card to their father ThomasAugust 4 marks Meghan\u0027s 37th birthday, the duchess\u0027s first as part of the Royal FamilyAround the time of Thomas Markle\u0027s 74th birthday, reports emerged that the reclusive former Hollywood lighting director hadn\u0027t spoken to his daughter in at least two months. Thomas has spoken about the estrangement in several interviews during that time, telling TMZ last month that he will continue talking to the media until he hears from Meghan. Meghan Markle\u0027s birthday wish every year is inspired by her...Prince Harry and Meghan Markle told friends \u0027if you talk to...Share this articleSamantha has been her father\u0027s most ardent defender amidst the media storm that has surrounded her half-sister\u0027s marriage to Prince Harry.

Gov. Billy Nungesser. He spoke at a news conference as the box\u0027s damp, musty contents were unpacked for the first time.He said New Orleans\u0027 City Park asked his office, which runs the state Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, to take custody of the time capsule, which was buried the year before the statue was erected.Nungesser said records indicate that another time capsule was buried under a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, which also was moved to storage last year. The other monuments were a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee and a small obelisk marking a Reconstruction-era fight between city and state militia and a group called the White League.Research is being done to find out who might own the capsules, said Nungesser, who supported proposed state legislation to keep the monuments in New Orleans, and then a proposal to move the three statues to a suburban plantation.\u0027We will work with the city to find out what is proper,\u0027 Nungesser said.Two private conservators carefully removed each artifact or piece of an artifact.

After the earlier tariffs $34billion of US goods, about $120billion is available for retaliation.The highest penalties on the new list would be imposed on honey, vegetables, mushrooms and chemicals, targeting farming and mining areas that supported President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.The new list includes products as varied as snow blowers and 3D printers, suggesting Chinese authorities are struggling to find enough imports their own economy can do without.          White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a briefing Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027Beijing\u0027s earlier round of tariffs appeared designed to minimize the impact on the Chinese economy by targeting soybeans, whiskey and other goods available from Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.Trump initially proposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200billion of Chinese imports, but he told trade officials this week to consider raising that to 25 percent. It will be September at the earliest before the U.S. decides whether to impose those tariffs.Chinese authorities warned earlier that if the dispute escalated, they would adopt unspecified \u0027comprehensive measures.\u0027 That prompted concern among American companies that retaliation might expand to disrupting their operations in China.The United States and China have the world\u0027s biggest trading relationship but official ties are increasingly strained over complaints that Beijing\u0027s technology development tactics hurt American companies.Trump\u0027s tariffs target goods the White House says benefit from industrial policies such as \u0027Made in China 2025\u0027, which calls for developing Chinese competitors in robotic, artificial intelligence and other fields.The dispute is part of broader US complaints about global trading conditions that have prompted Trump to raise duties on steel, aluminum, washing machines or solar panels from Canada, Europe, Japan and South Korea.A spokesman for China\u0027s foreign ministry appealed to Washington to negotiate but could not confirm reports the two sides were setting up talks.\u0027We urge the United States to come to its senses, correct its erroneous acts and create the necessary condition for a proper settlement as soon as possible,\u0027 spokesman Geng Shuang said.Trump campaigned on a promise to bring down America\u0027s massive trade deficits by renegotiating trade agreements and getting tough on countries like China that sell the U.S. far more than they buy from it.But the US Commerce Department reported Friday that the American trade deficit climbed to $46.3billion in June from $43.2billion in May. The deficit in goods trade with China also rose. So far this year, the trade gap is up more than seven percent from January-June 2017."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/03/21/4ECD630900000578-6024639-image-m-56_1533328731449.jpg","title":"Mines double Theyre supermarket spirits brazenly copy classics","story":"Caversham Pale Cream sherry is more than £5 cheaper than Croft Original SherryTwin Gins Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin 70cl, £9.99, AldiFrom the green bottle to the curly ‘G’, this looks like a close relative of Gordon’s.

All round, a better taste. 810  Old Hopking premium white rum might be almost a tenner cheaper than Bacardi, but it tastes it as well Coconut craze Coconut Cove 70cl, £4.29, LidlThis is billed as a Caribbean-style drink with coconut and rum flavours, but it really tastes of old suncream. Not even a cocktail umbrella can perk this up. 110Malibu Caribbean Rum 70cl, £15, TescoDangerously appealing with soft, sweet coconut aromas and flavours, this rum is much better than the cheaper alternative, even when it is mixed with fruit juice.

It’s certainly well-balanced, too. However, if I’m being honest, once again I struggle to find the cucumber in there. And it’s almost twice the price of the Aldi version.

Pit accidents were common I remember him saying how often they’d hear the siren, warning of an accident. And when he was seven, that siren rang for his father Joe, who was killed in a collapse.His mother remarried soon after and the family moved south, to Coventry. But their new stepfather was a violent man. By the age of 13, Dad felt he had to leave home. He told me he felt he might have killed his stepfather if he’d stayed.Taking his younger brother with him, Dad moved back to Scotland to live with their uncle, and found work in the local pit. It was the start of World War II and mining was a protected industry, so he was never called up to fight.After the war, Dad worked as a waiter at Butlins Holiday Camp at Filey in Yorkshire, and later at another camp at Portelet Bay, Jersey — which is where, in 1949, he met my mother Olive, then 19. It was love at first sight for them both.Dad moved to London to find work and to be near Olive, and they married in 1952, settling in Hounslow. At Mum’s suggestion, he began to study maths and engineering at night school, so he could find work as a tooling engineer.She also encouraged him to join her ballroom dancing lessons, which became a lifelong shared passion. They were a fixture in the world of ballroom and knew Len Goodman, the former Strictly judge. Dad’s speciality was the slow foxtrot.British tank sergeant nicknamed \u0027Titch\u0027 who was \u0027shortest...THIRTY emergency workers and 14 vehicles go to the rescue of...Share this articleWith his engineering qualifications, Dad worked for EMI and British Airways. His credo was fairness in the workplace he was already a member of the Labour Party when he met Mum and was becoming increasingly interested in local government.That passion led him to be elected to the local council, and he was even invited to stand as an MP for Feltham and Heston in the Seventies, but declined, fearing too much time away from the family.Dad felt that his role was to make life better on a local level. So when he was told to sign an eviction notice for an overcrowded property in Chiswick — Britain’s first home for battered wives, founded by Erin Pizzey — he refused.He was warned he might be prosecuted and go to prison, but Dad knew what life was like in a violent home and he stood firm, appearing on Thames Television’s Today programme to explain how important these sanctuaries were.He remained a friend of the Chiswick Women’s Aid movement, now known as Refuge, all his life. When the charity celebrated its 45th anniversary at the House of Lords in 2017, Dad and Mum were invited.Dad’s career in local government flourished and in 1978, he and Mum were selected as Mayor and Mayoress of Hounslow.His family, though, was the centre of his life and he was a loving father to my elder brother Kerry and me, and adoring grandfather to his four grandchildren.Dad and Mum retired to Windlesham in Surrey, where they continued to dance. When Mum developed dementia, Dad was happy to be her carer. He always credited her with ‘saving his life’ by encouraging him to study and better himself.Dad’s death was unexpected, following a routine heart operation. The day before he died, he and Mum had spent a lovely afternoon reminiscing. He was a gentleman to the last, who thrived on others’ happiness.James (Jim) Duffy, born May 16, 1926, died June 13, 2018, aged 92.  Stumped by the crossword? Blame my brilliant friend! MY COLLEAGUE NUALAby Richard ColferIf you find yourself scratching your head over the Giant Crossword on page 62 of today’s Mail, I hope you’ll spare a thought for Nuala. For the past 25 years she has been compiling that puzzle every Saturday, a run that will only come to an end in December when the final one, her 1,248th, which she completed before her death at the age of 90 last month, will be published.It all started 72 years ago. Shortly after the war, Nuala was working as an air hostess when she met Brian Considine, a pilot from Limerick who had been wounded in the Battle of Britain.Brian introduced her to cryptic crosswords and they subsequently compiled one together. To their joy and surprise, it was published by the Irish News when Nuala was still just 18.In the more than seven decades since, she is thought to have compiled more crosswords than anyone else in history.She was born Aisling Fionnuala Maire Kiernan on October 10, 1927, in London, the second of four children of Delia Kiernan, a noted Irish folk singer, and Dr Thomas J. Kiernan, a diplomat and later Ireland’s ambassador to West Germany and the U.S.          Nuala Considine is thought to have compiled more crosswords than anyone else in history. Notably shunning the use of computers — she preferred instead to design grids by hand to go alongside the neat, witty clues that were her hallmarkShe married Brian in 1948 and joined the press and puzzles agency Morley Adams Ltd (now part of the Press Association) in Fleet Street in 1955, where she worked for the rest of her life.In that time she compiled crosswords for a range of newspapers including the Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph and Daily Express (for some years setting all their daily cryptics single-handed).Once, when she was compiling a crossword called ‘The Stinker’ for the Weekend Mail, a group of people who used to try to tackle it together became so frustrated that they wrote to the paper asking for a photograph of the setter to put on their dartboard. The request was politely refused.She and Brian never had children and after his death in 1996 she carried on compiling, notably shunning the use of computers — she preferred instead to design grids by hand to go alongside the neat, witty clues that were her hallmark.I will remember her as a kind woman, ready with encouraging words and helpful advice, who loved splitting her time between Britain and her second home in San Diego.Even in her 80s she remained fit and active, showing amazing speed in providing a cup of tea and a slice of cake for guests, zipping up and down her stairs with ease.To hear that she had been diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer was an enormous shock, but Nuala accepted it with great dignity.Her funeral in London on Friday, July 27, was attended by many family members and friends, from crosswords and beyond, who couldn’t resist swapping stories in the pub afterwards.All I can say is that if her story has inspired you to try her crossword, please do! You won’t find a better one.Nuala Considine, born October 10, 1927, died July 24, 2018, aged 90.  Aaron\u0027s smile was a tonic for all who met him MY SON AARONby John MollittWhenever I think of my son Aaron, it’s his huge smile that comes to mind first. He was such a happy person — yet so disabled that he couldn’t even say hello.But Aaron had a way with him. Pushing him in his wheelchair through our tiny village of Ingleton in the Yorkshire Dales could take a couple of hours because everyone wanted to stop and see how he was.And that wonderful smile was such a tonic that I often took him with me when I visited hospitals in my role as a minister of Ingleton Evangelical Church. His presence seemed to be uplifting for others.The great tragedy was that when Aaron was born in August 1987, he was a healthy baby. His multiple disorders — spastic quadriplegia, epilepsy, severe spinal curvature and visual impairment — were caused when he was just four weeks old, by his violent biological father, a heroin addict.My wife Pat and I fostered him, intending to keep him for a year. We had two children and had fostered babies before. But Aaron had such profound needs that he became a full-time job for my wife.          Aaron Mollitt had profound disabilities, but his pleasures were simple. He loved being pushed in his wheelchair, to breathe fresh air and feel the breeze on his faceAnd somehow he became family, and our fostering role just kept going until, in 2004, when Aaron was 16, we adopted him.Of course, doctors warned us that Aaron’s health was not compatible with a long life. He had repeated chest infections and often needed hospital treatment. But Aaron was a fighter and kept defying the odds.He attended a special school in Carnforth until he was 18 and was very happy there. After he left, I took early retirement and we spent another happy decade together — he became a familiar figure at churches I visited, football and cricket matches, brass band concerts — in fact, everywhere we went.Great kindness was shown to us because of Aaron. One afternoon, we were having coffee and scones in a cafe but when we went to settle the bill, we were told the staff had had a whip-round and there was nothing to pay.When Aaron finally succumbed to a chest infection, the family was devastated.For someone with such profound disabilities, his pleasures were simple. He loved being pushed in his wheelchair, to breathe fresh air and feel the breeze on his face.And that’s how we remember him now, with an annual family walk up Ingleborough peak. We miss Aaron every day but we are so thankful for the years we spent with him.Aaron Luke Mollitt, born August 30, 1987, died May 18, 2016, aged 28.  Our \u0027Magic Mary\u0027 made crazy ideas come true MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW MARY MCDOWELLby Oenone McDowellEveryone knew my daughter-in-law as ‘Magic Mary’ because she could conjure up miracles out of thin air. She just had that knack of making the craziest ideas a reality.And the best example of that was when she and her friend Claire organised a huge fundraising event called the Pink Tie Ball for charity. They persuaded Sittingbourne Golf Club to host it free, then arranged wonderful auction prizes, including a VIP box at the Manchester United football ground. They raised more than £9,000 for the Medway Maritime Hospital.Sadly, the only magic trick Mary couldn’t pull off was beating breast cancer, although for ten years she gave it everything she had.Mary was born in Gillingham, Kent, the only girl in a family of seven and perhaps that’s why she grew up sports-mad, especially football (Gillingham FC) and playing netball and badminton.          Everyone knew my daughter-in-law Mary McDowell, pictured here with husband Rob, as ‘Magic Mary’ because she could conjure up miracles out of thin air She met my son Rob and there was a special bond between us from the start. I even made her wedding dress — a fashionable, bouffant affair (pictured).They went on to have two children, Samantha, born in 1988, and Ben, two years later. To celebrate, Rob bought her a gold necklace from a local jeweller. To their shock and delight, it turned out to be one that had been stolen from her in a burglary a year or two before.With her own children at school, Mary trained as a teaching assistant. She had left with few exam passes herself, but was in her element helping others.As a family, they loved camping and caravanning, taking their children to festivals and open-air concerts all over the country.

Gov. Billy Nungesser. He spoke at a news conference as the box\u0027s damp, musty contents were unpacked for the first time.He said New Orleans\u0027 City Park asked his office, which runs the state Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, to take custody of the time capsule, which was buried the year before the statue was erected.Nungesser said records indicate that another time capsule was buried under a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, which also was moved to storage last year. The other monuments were a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee and a small obelisk marking a Reconstruction-era fight between city and state militia and a group called the White League.Research is being done to find out who might own the capsules, said Nungesser, who supported proposed state legislation to keep the monuments in New Orleans, and then a proposal to move the three statues to a suburban plantation.\u0027We will work with the city to find out what is proper,\u0027 Nungesser said.Two private conservators carefully removed each artifact or piece of an artifact.

It was only returned in 2015, and since then, he has lived in self-imposed exile in Berlin.Ai had been expecting to leave the studio soon, his assistant Ga Rang told AFP, because the rental contract on the space had expired last autumn.However, Ga said, it had not been possible to remove all the artwork stored in the space because there was so much of it, and the sudden destruction put some of it at risk. “They came and started knocking down the windows today without telling us beforehand. There’s still so much stuff inside.”It was not clear if the destruction was targeting Ai directly. Chinese authorities have been clearing swathes of suburban Beijing over the last year, and residents near the studio said the former factory area was slated for redevelopment, AFP reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6559304eb2bd10f5d9d37e7d6447862e62dd4357/0_294_1734_1040/master/1734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11420ed9af5337f8115c6592a24fdbfa","title":"mark wallinger the human figure in space review giant leap","story":"Jerwood Gallery, HastingsIngeniously manipulated images and films of people trying to fly or stay airborne give a humorous twist to the Icarus mythIcarus, in the Greek myth, tries to escape the island of Crete wearing wings of wax and feather. He flies too high and the sun melts his contraption. The dream of flight fails, a moment depicted by Bruegel in his masterpiece Landscape With the Fall of Icarus as perhaps less heroic than absurd. Bruegel’s Icarus is nothing more than a pair of tiny legs, barely seen at the bottom of the picture: joke limbs vanishing into the ocean.This is very much the spirit of Mark Wallinger’s new show beside the sea in Hastings. Icarus everywhere presides. You see him made modern in a gallery of outlandish photographs of English men and women lurching into midair in a sequence of films expressly titled Landscape With the Fall of Icarus in a mirrored installation and an antic ballet on video. He is the inspiration for Wallinger’s ruminations on bodies moving through space and falling back to Earth. The smallest version of this event – the most modest flight, as it were – being the humble human leap.Jumping is what we’re encouraged to do in a vast black gallery with one mirrored wall. The space is open to running, cartwheeling, hurtling and dancing the mirror acts as further incitement. What do we look like airborne? The black walls are gridded with white strings, a way of measuring figures against space in exactly the manner of the Victorian photographer Eadweard Muybridge. Muybridge’s early studies of human and animal motion made an art of inquiry (very much Wallinger’s own modus operandi as a Turner prize-winning artist). And they asked mysterious questions: can we fly, however momentarily? Is a horse ever truly airborne?Wallinger the philosopher-comedian finds an outlandish version of Muybridge in the international Birdman competition which takes place further along the Sussex coast. Contestants leap from the end of the pier at Bognor or Worthing and “fly” as far as they can. This is often undertaken in fancy dress. At the Jerwood Gallery you see the Tin Man flailing, Frozen’s Elsa apparently floating, Woody from Toy Story about to plunge – but still in the air. Wallinger effectively reverses Muybridge’s stop-start sequences by taking a moving image and devolving it back into milli-second stills.These pictures look like a fiction at first. Each body seems wildly contorted, on its way from nowhere to nowhere. It seems as if gravity has no part to play. Some people appear to be rising – which indeed they are, in that instant others appear to be out of this world, which is in both senses true. And every one of them, after editing and cropping by Wallinger, speaks from the present back to Bruegel’s great painting of a human being who will rise and fall according to his own aspirations, however foolish, hubristic or mad. Each figure is just as tiny and abrupt, a body without context, made strangely weightless by the image.At the Jerwood you can look straight out of the floor-to-ceiling windows and see surfers and windsurfers rising and falling with the waves across the pebbled beach. Along the strand, fairground attractions take screaming pleasure-seekers high in the sky. Children jump. It is a fundamental urge. And we surely do it with no thought of falling.Wallinger’s Landscape With the Fall of Icarus brings together five films of people trying to fly, or at the very least pass through space without touching the ground. One man attempts to get across a river between two ropes stretched above the water perhaps he is a refugee, for a crowd of people stand on one side anxiously watching. He buckles and bends, almost toppling but still somehow upright. Another takes a zip line that fails, dunking him in mud. A third goes up into the air on something not much more sophisticated than Icarus wings, only to be blown towards the pylon that will bring him down.The films are slowed to a tenth of real time, aping the looped but stuttering movements of Muybridge’s stills animated through a zoopraxiscope lantern. Which brings the show’s themes and allusions full circle. In an exhibition of modest scale, this work is the strongest, presenting our human endeavour – all this trying and inevitable failing – over and again in an endless loop as if to extend the embarrassment and comedy. For with repetition the films become humorous, a series of running gags and slapstick, seesawing backwards and forwards. Wallinger treats the original films, and their subjects, with affectionate ingenuity, turning them into a comic meditation on myth and folly: Icarus at the end of the pier.• Mark Wallinger: The Human Figure in Space is at the Jerwood Gallery, Hastings, until 7 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa40c931e601354a856763f965d5ff442bd7a6d1/0_119_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c0735fd02a02025ea24defdde48be3f","title":"original observer photography","story":"President Trump’s visit to Britain, the Great British Bake Off, Big Narstie and a sweaty knight all feature in this showcase of the best commissioned photography in the Observer in July 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5032a63cd6b21b7cdef68de7d995a2f949a040ba/78_0_3289_1974/master/3289.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14618541060b0e5611c3b3379b2848a","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Wildfires in California, protests in Nicaragua and the face veil ban in Denmark – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8847882b971cf81c3da8959ece2eb4f5a79c589c/0_534_3786_2271/master/3786.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecbeb12f52969cbe57b62d4f663594e","title":"alan garner interview i just let the voice settle and listened memoir where shall we run to","story":"The acclaimed children’s author on writing a memoir about his wartime upbringing in rural CheshireAlan Garner’s glittering career started nearly six decades ago with The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, one of the great children’s books of the second half of the 20th century. Since then, he has written further fantasy novels including Elidor and the Carnegie-winning The Owl Service. His books for adults, including The Stone Book Quartet, Strandloper and Thursbitch, all centre on the Cheshire countryside in which his family has lived for more\u0026nbspthan 400 years. His latest book\u0026nbspis Where Shall We Run To?, a moving evocation of his wartime childhood.We visited Garner lives at the Blackden Trust in Alderley, which comprises Toad Hall, a barely modernised medieval timber-framed home, and the Old Medicine House, a 16th-century apothecary’s shop that he and his wife Griselda rescued from demolition in 1970 and transported 17 miles to abut Toad Hall. Garner is a keen archaeologist – stones and artefacts rattle through his books and his home is full of axe-heads and arrowheads, old coins and glimmering crystals.When you finished Boneland, the final instalment in the trilogy that began with The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, you said it would be your last book. How did you come to write Where Shall We Run To? I can’t stop writing. It’s not something I physically enjoy, but I can’t switch off the head. There was something else, something I’d\u0026nbsplived with all my life – the fear that I\u0026nbspwouldn’t live to finish a given piece. Having finished Boneland at the age of 77, with no idea in front of me whatever, I thought – that’s it.\u0026nbspAnd then an idea started to stir. Now, given that it takes me between five and nine years to write a novel, the joke runs a bit sour when you’re in your early 80s.Was it easier to write a memoir than a novel? No book of mine has ever had so many drafts. What I had to do was remove myself as an observer and let the voice of me at that age genuinely establish itself. The trouble there was that I didn’t want it to be arch or twee or laced through with dramatic irony. I like technical challenges. I just let it settle and listened, I didn’t try to impose anything on that voice as it emerged. It couldn’t be infantile, it must be simple. It expresses the complex thought of a child of that age.Did you have to read up on the period? Did you have a diary or other written record you could call upon? There was no research. To a fault, I love the research and it puts off the writing. But with this, I simply had to not interfere. It’s not mystical, it was just allowing myself to switch off the adult editor until the words were there.The book seems to be about how your education took you away from childhood companions. One of your friends’ mothers, rather than congratulating you on your 11-plus, says: “Well, Alan… you won’t want to speak to us any more.” The moment that ran off my pen, I almost cracked, because I didn’t see it coming. The price of my education was rejection. My family couldn’t cope with the change in me, nor could the friends of my childhood. I\u0026nbspwas ostracised from their community.Do you think that grammar schools\u0026nbspare a good idea? Because I’m an ancient historian, I’m utterly apolitical, but I do think the criticism of the grammar school system is indicative of a levelling instinct that I’m entirely against.The book paints a vivid portrait of your mother, who nursed you through a host of near-fatal childhood\u0026nbspillnesses and appeared to\u0026nbsphave high ambitions for you. I think the second world war was my mother’s high point, because she was very good at coping. In technical psychological terms, she was what is known as a narcissistic parent. She was bringing me up to be what she had not been able to be. RS Thomas says it in a poem called Ap\u0026nbspHuw’s Testament: “My mother gave me the breast’s milkGenerously, but grew mean after,Envying me my detached laughter.” As soon as I started to develop my own mind, it was shocking to her. The all-embracing loving mother became the destroying harpy. That destroying harpy existed until her death.Your father is a more distant figure, despite one memorable scene on Alderley Edge… He was only away at the war for a year, but that rural culture I grew up in appeared to be patriarchal in that the sexes had no communal social life. My father’s pattern every day was to come home at lunch, the meal would have to be on the table, and he’d eat and get up and walk out. My memory of my parents’ relationship, which was common to all of my companions, was that the father came in from work at the end of the day, had tea, got out of working clothes into smarter clothes, went to the pub, came home and went to bed. My mother spent her life, as far as I can remember it, sitting by the fire doing crossword puzzles.Which novelists or nonfiction authors writing today do you most admire? I don’t read fiction. In nonfiction, it’s\u0026nbspspecialists I like. Richard Bradley, a prehistorian, is writing some of the most imaginative work based on\u0026nbspsolid archaeological scholarship.What do you read for pleasure? Biography, history, anything that catches my eye. I’m a complete magpie. What books are on your bedside\u0026nbsptable? I’m usually so tired I just go to bed. It’s likely to be philosophy, but that sounds so pretentious, doesn’t it? I’m someone who always had a path ahead of me – Classical Mods and Greats – I still read a great deal of philosophy.How do you organise your books? This end of the room is spillage, where it all starts to fall apart. Otherwise I organise them methodically as a library. I don’t use\u0026nbspa Dewey Decimal system, but they are arranged by subject. I’ve got\u0026nbspabout 11,000 books and fewer than a hundred novels.What was the best book you ever received as a present? It was when I was a child, I would have been about seven. It was The Box of Delights by John Masefield.What book would you give to a child?

Sun blazes out of a blank sky, heat beats “like a hammer on the pavement”, silencing the birds. A bookseller shuts up his shop and flees the city, but in his sunstruck confusion forgets a map. Lost, he comes upon a cool holloway, “a tunnel of green shade” that leads to “the edge of a dying lawn sloping slightly upward to a distant house … it seemed to me the most real and solid thing I’d ever seen, and yet at the same time a trick of my sight.” A child’s voice calls his name and he enters.The reader enters oddly familiar territory, too – territory that has seemed so ever since LP Hartley published The Go-Between in 1953. Hartley’s mesmerising novel about 12-year-old Leo, who finds himself, under slightly false pretences, in a grand house in Norfolk in a heatwave in 1900, was of course not the first to use summer as a framing device. There was Edith Wharton’s uneven but lingering 1917 novel Summer, for instance, and F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925) – but Hartley understood so well what summer allowed, it is sometimes hard not to see everything else in its light. “In the heat the senses, the mind, the heart, the body, all told a different tale,” as Leo puts it. “One felt another person, one was another person.” So too for the novelist, who is suddenly given the freedom to explore ideas and dilemmas that would have seemed implausible if the weather had stayed cool.At its most basic, this means a release from the usual constraints, although at the same time summer provides a usefully closed system. In The Cement Garden, Ian McEwan’s short fever-dream of a novel, 40 years old this year, a mother dies, orphaning her children, on the last day of term, stranding them in a summer that McEwan (who, as Alexandra Harris notes in Weatherland, has been explicit about The Go-Between’s influence on his work) points out contains “the hottest day since 1900”. But the reader knows, or at least guesses, that even though the children bury their mother in the basement, in concrete – even though all order breaks down and the kitchen, like their world, becomes “a place of stench and clouds of flies” – adult structure and authority, if only in the guise of school, must at some point reassert themselves. Colson Whitehead’s Sag Harbor (2009) begins on the first day of the summer holidays, as a family arrives on Long Island – and immediately posits an ending: “Ask, How long are you out for? … and all answers contemplated the end, the death of summer in its very beginning.” The reader knows that whatever “teenage entropy” ensues (for, as in The Cement Garden, Whitehead largely removes parents from the picture), some sort of order will eventually prevail. JL Carr called his brief, luminous, utterly original 1980 novel of a recently demobbed soldier finding peace and purpose in a Yorkshire belfry A Month in the Country. Carr played with his self-imposed constraints. Birkin, and another ex-soldier, Moon, are the classic strangers entering the closed system of a small village in summer at the same time, they make a working fraternity of two, which the villagers and a beautiful (married) woman interrupt.McEwan’s 2001 novel Atonement begins in a country house one hot day, when a misunderstanding by a child, Briony, of an adult sexual encounter (as in The Go-Between) changes the course of many lives. At one point Leon, Briony’s brother, observes “I love England in a heatwave. It’s a different country. All the rules change”, a deliberate allusion to Hartley’s opening line, one of the best-known of any English novel. Leon’s England is, as in Hartley’s novel, prewar upper-class England, when the rules were so much more evident, and the existential effect of their loosening so much greater. (The debt to Hartley was originally even clearer: in an early draft a novel by the adult Briony was rejected by Cyril Connolly, who noted: “I trust you’ve read The Go-Between.” McEwan was disappointed when he was told it was an anachronism and had to take it out.) Sag Harbor is similarly anchored and contained by a house in the Hamptons, a holiday home: important partly because it represents the hard work it took to afford it, and partly because, like almost every other house in Sag Harbor, it belongs to a black family. Although another summer house not far away, where memory is inextricable from lost happiness, turns out to be more important still.Taking characters to another (hot) country for a short space of time works, too: So Rachel Cusk, in Outline (2014), removes her protagonist to broiling Athens to teach a course Deborah Levy, in Hot Milk (2016), parks a mother and daughter in southern Spain in August. Constraint is useful for the basic plot reason that it can force unexpected people together summer adds heat to the pressure.Heat and long days do interesting things to time, and, however short and finite the season, it can give the impression both of being separate – “Summer is its own time”, as Whitehead puts it in Sag Harbor – and of going on for ever. “There was so much time that marvellous summer,” remembers Birkin in A Month in the Country. “Day after day, mist rose from the meadow as the sky lightened and the hedges, barns and woods took shape until, at last, the long curving back of the hills lifted away from the plain. It was a sort of stage-magic. … I had a feeling of immense content and, if I thought at all, it was that I’d like this to go on and on, no one going, no one coming, autumn and winter always loitering around the corner, summer’s ripeness lasting forever.” In The Cement Garden, there is too much time, terrible time, dripping and sweating and shapeless. In After Me Comes the Flood, the bookseller John Cole is repelled by the degree to which the adult inhabitants of the mysterious house drift through summer days, lost in games, making papier-mache heads, building a kind of curdled, dangerous child-world.Long time, and often deep time: Sag Harbor is, among other things, a bravura enactment of how the repetitiveness of summer – the arrival, the hope, the familiar porches and the corners of beach – both anchor a self and illuminate how it is changing how Benji and his friends (and his parents’ friends, and his grandparents’ friends) find themselves mingling “with who we had been, and who we would be”. Tove Jansson’s The Summer Book (1972), a small wonder of a novel, occurs over the warm months after a six-year-old’s mother has died, and which she, her father and her grandmother are spending on a small island in the Gulf of Finland. The father is largely absent, working, or planting misguided gardens, so the girl spends her time with her grandmother who, close to the end of her own life, is able to drift through the nightless days sharing the rhythm of a child’s vivid present. One summer, but also a lifetime of summers, memories growing out of each other, like the underbrush the two know so intimately the tree trunks, ferns and lichens and moss, layered and revealing glimpses of each other. Much of the power of the last third of To the Lighthouse, too, comes from Virginia Woolf setting one summer moment against another in the same place, but 10 devastating years later the attempt to repeatcomplete an innocent trip only underlining how impossible that is.Because things must change. In F Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, Jay Gatsby moves to West Egg and attempts, with his golden net of money, to recapture the summer when he and Daisy Buchanan fell in love in André Aciman’s Call Me by Your Name (2007), Oliver comes to stay with Elio’s family for a summer in the Italian Riviera, and Elio discovers a love against which all his later life will be measured. And in Hartley’s Norfolk, Leo loses his innocence. Early on he sees the elder daughter of the house, Marian, saying farewell to a man. But when Marian’s mother asks if they met anyone in town, Leo is so distracted by the pleasure of being chosen by Marian, who has just bought him beautiful clothes better suited to the heat than those he arrived in, he forgets and says no – thus committing his first act of complicity, and displaying his suitability as a go-between. For the next few weeks Leo enjoys the heat, is ecstatic with it, but becomes caught between Marian and her working-class lover, Ted, feeling but not always comprehending the degree to which his childhood is being stripped away.The moment Leo definitively grows up is the moment he learns what “spooning” is for Briony it is the day she thinks she sees her sister being attacked. The Cement Garden builds inexorably to a moment of transgressive sex – sex that might never have occurred if it wasn’t so hot, if the children weren’t so alone, if there were any boundaries operative at all. The discovery of sex isn’t always terrible, of course in Sag Harbor, for instance, Benji experiences his (classically underwhelming but nevertheless precious) first kiss. The summer fling is a cliche – elegantly mocked in, for example, Michael Frayn’s 2012 Greek island farce Skios – but that only underlines its ongoing power as an idea, which is of sudden possibility, of the promise of self-fulfilment and a kind of adult joy no less potent for probably being doomed. “If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures,” thinks Nick in The Great Gatsby, “then there was something gorgeous” about Gatsby, “some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life … he had an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.” The summer is an emblem of it.Summer is full of erotic charge. People wear fewer clothes, see more of each other. Things grow into ripeness, and more than ripeness, which is exciting but also threatening, overwhelming – a worry traced again and again through female sexuality. So the belladonna plant that plays a starring role in The Go-Between is a none-too-subtle metaphor in The Cement Garden a hormone-soaked teenage boy watches, fascinated and discomfited, as his sister flowers into adulthood. Charity Royall’s sexual awakening amid the proprieties of turn-of-the-last-century rural America is, in Summer, Edith Wharton’s central subject. In Salvage the Bones – Jesmyn Ward’s devastating 2011 novel set in the summer of 2005 in an isolated, rackety house in coastal Mississippi – sex is something 15-year-old narrator Esch takes almost for granted the discovery that she is pregnant, “womanly ripe”, however, changes the emotional landscape almost as much as Hurricane Katrina will alter its physical lines.In Hot Milk the young female protagonist visits her father and his new partner, then returns to the Spanish beach where she is suffering a doomed love for another woman. “I was flesh thirst desire dust blood lips cracking feet blistered knees skinned hips bruised, but I was so happy not to be napping on a sofa under a blanket with an older man by my side and a baby on my lap” – the latter a situation that in Wharton’s Summer seems the best possible outcome for a young woman in Charity’s position. And yet even this progress is not what it seems, because a central theme of Hot Milk, published more than a century later, is how much of the mother’s indefinable illness is a response to a marriage – traditionally the culmination of the season of love – in which she “could not find the words for how her own wishes for herself had been dispersed in the winds and storms of a world not arranged to her advantage”.It is not just women who find the world organised for someone else’s gain, however. Again and again summer is cast as a time when the icy ramparts of class might, just possibly, melt. The young man Wharton’s Charity meets is an urbane, book-writing architecture enthusiast from New York. Gatsby’s dubiously acquired money, spent on parties, a pool, a huge house, gives him the illusion for a few short weeks that he might claim to be Daisy Buchanan’s social equal. In Helen Cross’s My Summer of Love (2001), the father at the big house asks the working-class girl who mucks out his pony to make friends with his troubled daughter. In The Go-Between, Leo enables Ted and Marian to continue their trysts, and feels increasingly at home in a milieu far grander than his own. What is happening, he feels, is nothing less than a “struggle between order and lawlessness, between obedience to tradition and defiance of it, between social stability and revolution”.But even as these class-crossings seem possible, isions become apparent. Leo is troubled by small moments – his hostess noting how well his clothes are mended, or his friend mocking him for wearing his school hat in the country – that illuminate his social inferiority. Charity works in the village library but has no education when the young man from New York asks for advice, at once she sees the gulf between them, and while later she can briefly forget it, it is always there, getting deeper.Which is of course one sign of the irreversible process of growing up – a glimpse of one’s relation to the world and to other people. In Summer, the fourth volume in Karl Ove Knausgaard’s season-cycle, published in June, he remembers his youthful summers as being the worst time of year, because they were “accompanied by an expectation of pleasure and joy and groups of friends swimming or boating or on holiday and there I sat … while the sun was shining outside and I didn’t know where to go or what to do … it marked me, not just who I was in the eyes of others, but also who I was to myself.” Leo, while glorying in a kind of zenith of the self, becomes alienated in fundamental ways – yearning for a more glamorous life, troubled by the duplicities he is being required to enact, while only, like the child he is, wanting to please. Marian, “I dimly realised, was the rock on which I was split.”In the summer light things seem clearer, more vividly themselves than at any other time. Just before the harvest ends, Birkin is taken on a Sunday school picnic. “For me that will always be the summer day of summer days – a cloudless sky, ditches and roadside deep in grass, poppies, cuckoo pint, trees heavy with leaf, orchards bulging over hedge briars.” Charity goes on a buggy ride with the youth she now knows loves her too. “The haze of the morning had become a sort of clear tremour over everything, like the colourless vibration of a flame”: Wharton uses the word flame so often in this novel that it has to be deliberate: a flare of great heat and light containing in itself extinguishment and ashes.One great power of Hartley’s book is the contrast between Leo’s bright conviction that he is among the “inheritors of summer and the coming glory of the 20th century”, and the knowledge shared by the narrator (Leo in the 1950s) and the reader of just how terrible the first half of that century was going to be. In The Great Gatsby, the first world war is only just over, and any travel from East or West Egg to New York City requires one to pass the valley of ashes. A Month in the Country is set in 1920 Birkin somehow survived Passchendaele – the extreme shade a setting for his jewel of a Yorkshire summer, an unlooked-for gift given “on borrowed time”. Atonement begins in 1935, the second world war a coming darkness that gives extra brightness and fragility to the summer day. There is a whole subgenre of fictions set in the heatwave of 1976, when writers could use the ominous background of National Front marches, forest fires, a falling pound and the Notting Hill carnival riot: Maggie O’Farrell’s Instructions for a Heatwave, Alex Wheatle’s The Seven Sisters, Ruth RendellBarbara Vine’s A Fatal Inversion, Stephen Poliakoff’s play Strawberry Fields. And by simply mentioning the word Katrina, Ward invokes the ruin that will be visited on thousands of largely black, largely poor families like Esch’s their father tries to prepare for it, but he is chaotic and alcoholic, and for a long time his children, preoccupied with their own challenges, do not listen. The reader, however, knows what kind of storm is coming.So there is ripening, flowering, fecundity, but also, as the heat climbs, putrefaction, the unpredictable dog days, the invisible, gathering flood (Sarah Perry’s title is, as an engine of inevitable dread, extremely effective). The tension in The Go-Between comes less from the mechanical threat of the lovers’ being discovered than from a growing sense of moral tarnishment, a deflowering, the reader willing Leo to step back before it’s too late. The Great Gatsby, as with a whole later line of novels and short stories (by James Salter, John Updike, Fitzgerald’s own Tender Is the Night) set among privileged Americans, already contains its fallenness. The days and nights are beautiful, white sand and green grass and blue breakers, but full of alcohol and faithlessness Gatsby’s parties, all “whisperings and champagne and stars”, whirl around an empty core. “But it’s so hot!” wails Daisy Buchanan, late in the novel and on the verge of tears, looking out at Long Island Sound “stagnant in the heat”. “And everything is so confused. Let’s all go into town!” They end up in a New York City hotel room, drinking too much, the thin veneer of respectability cracking all about them. In The Cement Garden, the mother’s body releases a terrible smell and splits the cement open.Remarkably often in novels that take summer for their shape and impetus, a day of unbearable heat coincides with a major set piece (a cricket match, a concert, a harvest party, a homecoming festival, a firework display, a declaration of the heart) – and a storm. “During the night,” Birkin says, “the year had crossed into another season.” All too suddenly possibilities wither. The marriage survives, the upstarts are vanquished – they kill themselves, or sacrifice themselves to a loveless marriage, or are sent to war. Gatsby floats dead in his lovely pool, then is buried alone in the rain – punishment for the delusion that with his wild chutzpah he could bridge the ide between his beginnings and his dreams, could finally reach the little green light at the end of the dock. The upper classes close ranks. There’s a disappointing conservatism about it – where is the revolution so confidently promised? – or perhaps more accurately, a chilly realpolitik: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together.” Sag Harbor never even makes the pretence that racial isions might be healed: part of the preciousness of summer at this particular beach is that it is a breathing space a couple of months without the need to “know where the exits were in case something racial went down”.“A few days of autumn cold had wiped out all trace of the rich fields and languid groves,” writes Wharton. “She could no longer believe that she was the being who had lived them she was someone to whom something irreparable and overwhelming had happened, but the traces of the steps leading up to it had almost vanished.” Over and over again one summer becomes the hinge, often but not always the high point, of an entire life.The question then is how to look back on it: as tragedy and the cancellation of a life’s promise (The Go-Between)? As a mistake for which to make decades of reparations (Atonement)? As unavoidable as growing up, and thus an everyday grief (Sag Harbor)? Or perhaps just sometimes, it is possible to attain a different kind of realism, to celebrate, as Elio’s father tells him in Call Me by Your Name, a brief time where hope and life and love were, against all odds, at one. “Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. Most of us can’t help but live as if we have two lives … one a mockup, the other the finished version … but there’s only one and before you know it your heart is worn out.” Grasp the moment, even though you know it will pass. “Ah those days,” writes Carr in A Month in the Country, which is that extraordinary thing, a novel that manages to bring alive, without sentimentality, a rare, unlooked-for few weeks of gentle happiness. “Sometimes, listening to music, I drift back and nothing has changed. The long end of summer. Day after day of warm weather, voices calling as night came on and lighted windows pricked the darkness and, at day-break, the murmur of corn and the warm smell of fields ripe for harvest. And being young”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbb9e4e07d6401a51100fbf6ef776b9f40a90da9/0_479_5322_3194/master/5322.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8de65c985ae3c75894501770405c819","title":"book clinic books relationship animals carl safina alex preston","story":"Which books best depict our relationship with other species without being oversentimental or too philosophical?Carlos Lugo-Ortiz, 52, professor of biology and entomology, Ponce, Puerto RicoCharles Foster, author of the Baillie Gifford-longlisted Being a Beast (Profile, £8.99), writes:The stipulation “over-sentimental” indicates, I assume, impatience with anthropomorphism. I’m impatient with that impatience. Anthropomorphism, as the American biologist Carl Safina puts it, is a “our best first guess”.

The short-term loan firm said the development was a way of coping with a surge in claims from former customers seeking compensation.The claims, said Wonga, related to loans taken out before 2014, when outrage over its payday lending offers prompted new rules to cap the cost of borrowing. The UK’s payday lending industry has been criticised by campaigners who claim its high interest rates and marketing tactics unfairly target vulnerable borrowers. A Wonga spokesman, confirming the £10m injection, said its shareholders remained “fully supportive of management’s plans for the business”. “Wonga continues to make progress against the transformation plan set out for the business. In recent months, however, the short-term credit industry has seen a marked increase in claims related to legacy loans, driven principally by claims management company activity.” The lender was forced to scrap its business model after running into regulatory problems and because of the cap on loan rates introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2015.Wonga announced a loss of nearly £65m in 2016, but insisted it was on track to return to profitability in 2017. The company has had a controversial past. In 2015, an inquest into the death of Kane Sparham-Price, a disabled teenager from Greater Manchester, found that he had had “numerous problems including those connected with his mental health”. He killed himself on the same day that Wonga emptied out his bank account for debts he owed the firm.The archbishop of Canterbury attacked payday lenders in 2013, claiming they had destroyed lives and said that he wanted to “compete Wonga out of existence”.

It won’t be long before we’ve returned to the familiar routine – just who is in crisis this week? – but for now it feels as though the Premier League will be swimming through the wash of the World Cup. The transfer window seems barely to have opened and yet is already in its last week, players have been still drifting back from holiday over the past few days, nothing seems to have had time to settle.That should, in theory, mean this title race is less predictable than usual, at least at its outset – and, while it would be misleading to suggest that the season after a World Cup has a habit of throwing up surprise winners, it is true that the Premier League in a season after a World Cup tends to be won with fewer points than usual. Not since Manchester United in 1998-99 has a post-World Cup league champion attained more points than the average of the champion over the previous three seasons – and that was in a pre-globalised world before every team had half a dozen players who had been at the tournament.Set against that, though, is Manchester City. It is not just that they broke every conceivable record in lifting the title in May, it’s that for a couple of months around the midpoint of the season they seemed to be playing a different game to everybody else. They clearly have the resources to buy if they need to – and the attempt to sign Jorginho suggested Pep Guardiola sees a potential shortfall in the middle of midfield – but they are in the enviable position of having a balanced squad that is still growing together and are under no compunction to buy. As mutual understanding develops, it is possible that their interactions could become even slicker.There are questions about their defence against the very best opponents, but just because Liverpool were able to expose them twice last season does not mean other sides will be able to Tottenham tried to take them on in both league games and ended up losing by an aggregate 7-2.A bigger threat would seem to be City’s nature, the vague whiff of Cityitis that has perhaps not yet entirely been expunged by Sheikh Mansour’s billions. There was something slightly uncomfortable about Guardiola’s remark in his first season in Manchester that City were a club that lacked history, but he was right to the extent that they are not a club with the sort of history he is used to. City have never before retained the league title and, while their relegation as champions in 1937-38 remains an extreme example, even recently they have tended to respond to winning the league by dozing through the campaign that followed.It is hard to believe a coach as driven as Guardiola will allow that to be an issue again and he has a squad with the depth to cover for any World Cup fatigue, particularly after the acquisition of Riyad Mahrez. It is not quite like his final two seasons at Bayern, when the league seemed a given, but, even more than in 2017-18, Guardiola will be judged this season on how City fare in Europe.As to who City’s main challengers will be, the best guide is probably José Mourinho. There is a reason why the guns of his propaganda machine, when they have not been trained on his own board and their inability to land him the players he wants, have this summer been largely directed at Anfield. The arrival of Alisson has addressed Liverpool’s obvious goalkeeping deficiency, while Fabinho, Naby Keïta and Xherdan Shaqiri are necessary additions to a squad that by the end of last season was looking threadbare. Jürgen Klopp is the only manager in the world with a positive record against Guardiola and, while it would be absurd to suggest Liverpool have anything like the depth of City, they are edging towards the point at which concrete returns will be expected.The implication is Mourinho already sees the battle this season as being for second behind City. He tried to portray being runners-up last season as a triumph but the mood this summer has been flatter than it was last – in part because of the way Romelu Lukaku and Paul Pogba looked better players at the World Cup, having escaped Mourinho’s clutches.Given how late Daniel Levy likes to leave things, Spurs’ transfer business cannot properly be assessed until the final second of the window has elapsed but, with no major arrivals, a squad that played more minutes at the World Cup than any other in the ision and with a new stadium to move into, it is hard to imagine them presenting a stronger challenge this season than they did last.Chelsea’s endless flux goes on with another new manager – sadly, they did finally sack Antonio Conte, denying us the possibility of him and Maurizio Sarri competing in the same technical area to direct the side – while it is not even clear Arsenal are still part of this conversation. Have they appointed a Europa League specialist because they have accepted they are a Europa League club, or is Unai Emery ready to step up a level and drag them with him? Their spending has been interesting rather than extravagant, which may ultimately be for the best, but hardly speaks of a club intending to surf back into the top four on a wave of new blood.It should be City then the rest but, as the post-World Cup hangover fades, the overwhelming sense at the moment is disbelief that the alarm is beeping already and that the working day is about to begin again. But in that may lie the challengers’ opportunity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0471f9c29380e4365a4e9b0aa1fc703636052e1e/0_225_4492_2696/master/4492.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75022ad55aaae49bcb8261be6978236","title":"sheffield united v swansea city championship live","story":"The Swans came from behind to win a cagey match at Bramall Lane.And that’s your lot. All that’s left is to point you in the direction of our man Richard Jolly’s match report. Nighty night!A disappointed Chris Wilder speaks. “We can’t defend like that against quality players. We have to defend properly. We haven’t gone with runners, we’ve not blocked. It’s a game we could have won, but shouldn’t have got beat in. And that’s the harsh reality of Championship football. We have to learn pretty quickly that if it is a tight game, we must get something from it. It’s disappointing.”That man Potter speaks. “I thought we did really well. It was a tough game for us. We limited them in the first half, and we weren’t as good as we wanted to be ourselves, but to come here and quieten the crowd, and make it a flat game was good for us. In the second half we showed quality and character. I’m proud of the lads and pleased for our supporters. You can’t do anything with 11 players, you need a substitute to make an impact. It’s testament to the group we have, that players want to come on and help the team. Any win in football is hard. It’s nice for the supporters to go home happy.”Another 45 games to go, and you’ll be unlucky if you see a worse half of football this season than the opening period of this match. But the second half delivered, with both teams contributing to the entertainment. Sheffield United were solid for the most part, and scored a well-worked goal through George Baldock. But while Swansea took an awfully long time to get going, they had the two most potent attackers on show, in Barrie McKay and the substitute Jefferson Montero. That pair would trouble any team in this ision, and they ended up causing United all sorts of bother, turning the match around with their skilful dribbles. Yan Dhanda’s debut goal, scored less than 30 seconds after he came on, was the cherry on the cake of a good first day at the office for Graham Potter.But Swansea hold on, and it’s a dream debut for Graham Potter!90 min +3: Sharp races down the right and hooks into the centre. Van der Hoorn clears. Duffy tries from the other flank. Fernandez clears. Montero is sent scampering into space down the left, on the counter. He looks for McKay in the centre, which allows Henderson to claim and launch one Hail Mary attack.90 min +2: Sharp tries to control a cross from Stevens on the right. It clanks out for a goal kick. He explodes in anger, demanding a corner that isn’t going to come. “Just catching up. Dundee United circa 2013? Sob!!! I’m like Andy Murray in Washington here.” He’s left it late. But I knew I’d smoke out Simon McMahon with that line.90 min: There will be four added minutes.89 min: The corner isn’t anything to write home about. Bramall Lane groans as one. Barring the travelling section belting out their Hymns and Arias, of course.88 min: Baldock curls a cross in from the right. The ball clanks into an unsighted Roberts, and nearly flies into the top right! Nordfeldt paws it away for a corner.87 min: United respond to that blow by replacing Basham with Duffy.Montero tears down the left again, reaches the byline, and finds McKay with another looping cross. McKay brings the ball down and cuts inside to shoot. He’d score, but he’s brought down clumsily by O’Connell. It would be a penalty, but the ball breaks to Dhanda, who has been on the pitch a matter of seconds. And he slams it into the net!85 min: Dhanda replaces Fulton. And this is some substitution, because ...83 min: McKay has been Swansea’s bright spark up front all right. Now he rattles the crossbar! Montero makes good down the left and crosses deep. McKay chests down, cuts across the ball, and sends a curler towards the top left. Henderson is beaten, but the woodwork saves the day for Sheffield United!82 min: Woodburn drifts in from the left, and lifts long, looking for Sharp. The ball bounces through to Nordfeldt, and rears up while doing so the Swansea keeper does very well to claim the ball on his line.80 min: As Baldock punishes himself by punching his own hand, Lundstram is replaced by Sharp.79 min: Montero dribbles down the left in the baroque style. Baldock gets in the way, and tries to usher the ball out for a goal kick. But Montero battles his way round the defender, and he’s making his way along the byline! He lifts a cross towards McBurnie, who tries to gently help the ball into the bottom right with a deft header. Henderson’s beaten, but the ball agonisingly drifts wide of the right-hand post.77 min: United have obviously decided to twist. A corner down the left, which leads to nothing. But they’re on the front foot again, having momentarily had the wind taken out of their sails by McBurnie’s equaliser.76 min: Evans, deep on the right, magic-wands a delicious low cross towards Clarke, coming in towards the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. But the striker can’t quite connect.75 min: Both teams take turns to stroke it around slowly at the back. Time for a breather, and to decide whether to stick or twist.73 min: Ben Woodburn comes on to make his debut for Sheffield United. McGoldrick makes way.McKay has been Swansea’s most potent attacker. He drives down the inside right, and one-twos with McBurnie. Suddenly he’s in the area, on the penalty spot, clean through! Clarke tries to toe the ball away from behind, but only succeeds in sending it towards the bottom right. Henderson saves brilliantly, but can only parry the ball to McBurnie, who slams home from close range and disappears in a glorious bundle of fans behind the goal. 69 min: The resulting corner comes to nought.68 min: He has now! McKay jinks in from the right and chips towards Fulton, who tries to eyebrow the ball over Henderson and into the top left. It’s going in, but Henderson arcs his back and tips over the crossbar. What a save!66 min: Swansea ping it around, 30 yards from the United goal. But the hosts are holding their shape well. There’s nothing doing for them in the middle. The young keeper Henderson, who looked nervous in the early exchanges of his debut, hasn’t been tested at all.64 min: It’s kind of absurd to say, given how the first 50-odd minutes of this match had gone. But that had been coming! Swansea respond by hooking Asoro and sending on Montero.This is a lovely goal! Fleck slips a pass down the inside-left channel to Stevens, who pulls one back from the byline. To the left of the D, Baldock meets the ball first time, sidefooting gloriously into the bottom left!60 min: Suddenly we’ve got a game! Carroll glides in from the right and unleashes a rising shot that isn’t far away from the top left at all! Somewhere, in a parallel universe, four goals have been scored in the last seven minutes.59 min: From a Swansea throw, Lundstram intercepts, one-twos with McGoldrick, then shanks a dreadful effort wide right with the goal begging.58 min: Swansea ping it around nicely in the Martinez-Rodgers style. But then Celina plays a loose one to McGoldrick, who races towards the Swansea box. McGoldrick opens his body and tries to fashion a low curler into the bottom left. He beats Nordfeldt, but he’s also set the ball too far wide, and it flies past the post.56 min: Swansea pin United back for a couple of minutes. Some pretty passes back and forth, this way and that across the front of the United box. But there’s no way to prise open some space in the middle. The hosts hold firm.54 min: Baldock wedges a pass down the inside-left channel for Clarke, who enters the box and tries to dribble inside, where he hopes to shoot. But the ball doesn’t stick to his boot.53 min: United stroke it around the back awhile. Then Evans gives it away in the midfield. McKay whizzes down the left. He’s in on goal, but opts to roll a pass across for Asoro, who takes a touch and sees his eventual shot blocked at source by O’Connell.50 min: Clarke and van der Hoorn collide in the midfield, as the pair challenge for a high ball. There’s some rolling about. Other than that, nothing is happening.48 min: We begin again where we left off. It’s very, very scrappy. Celina bursts down the left but clips the heel of Egan, who falls on his face while conceding a corner. But Swansea won’t get the set piece because United get the foul.46 min: McKay tears down the left and zips past a static Egan. He enters the box but O’Connell comes over at pace. McKay panics, and toe-pokes the ball out of play for a goal kick. A promising run, though.And we’re off again! No changes. United get the ball rolling for the second half.Half-time reading: Today’s Football League round-up, for your pleasure.It’s going to be a long season if they keep this up.45 min: From a throw-in on the left, needlessly conceded by Henderson, Swansea fashion a half-chance. The ball’s sent in from the wing by Olsson. Asoro brings it down and pokes goalwards Egan clears off the line.

From a rebirthing session to holotropic breathwork, Richard Godwin inhales the latest wellness crazeAre you sitting comfortably? Airways clear, back straight, no respiratory conditions? OK. Take a series of short, deep breaths. Activate your diaphragm, pull the air right down into your belly, let the chest fall. Repeat 30-40 times. Feeling a little floaty? Fingers tingling? Don’t worry. It’s just oxygen saturating your cells.Now take a big breath, then expel all the air from your lungs and hold it. Relax, you’ll be fine. (As long as you’re not doing this in a swimming pool.) That slight feeling of panic? It’s nothing to worry about. You might be surprised how long you can push it before you have to take a huge gasp.After three attempts, I managed three minutes 23 seconds of not breathing. The person who formulated this exercise, Dutch endurance specialist and multiple world record holder Wim Hof, 59, has trained himself to go up to six or seven minutes. He claims that by performing this exercise daily (along with a regimen of cold showers and meditation), we can help treat a whole suite of conditions and diseases, from depression to arthritis. “It’s so simple,” he tells me. “That’s why people overlook it. They stay in their brains thinking, ‘This cannot be so simple.’ But it is!”While Hof may be the most eccentric person to tout breath as a panacea for the 21st century, he is not alone. I first started noticing how fashionable breathing had become when I moved to Los Angeles in 2016. One of the first people I met, an English film producer, had just had the word “BREATHE” tattooed on her wrist. New friends told me about conscious breathwork circles and breathing re-education classes. Hardcore gym types talked excitedly about breathing as a “remote control for the brain”. Even Hillary Clinton claimed, in her book What Happened, that yogic alternate-nostril breathing was what helped her get over losing the presidential election to Donald Trump: “Breathing deeply from your diaphragm, place your right thumb on your right nostril and your ring and little fingers on your left…” and so on.Now breathing classes and retreats have reached Britain, too: the Transformational Breath Foundation UK lists events all over the country, promising that “you’ll access the full potential of your breathing system”. “Breathfulness” is touted as the new mindfulness (though one attendee of a recent session in London described it as “yoga without the yoga”). Breathing: once you start noticing it, everyone’s doing it.And, in some ways, it’s inevitable. A whole self-care industry has made us doubt everything we do naturally – eat, exercise, sleep – and breathing is at the heart of it all. Since you do it around 16 times a minute, 960 times an hour and 23,040 times a day, there’s an awful lot of room for improvement.Still sitting comfortably? You can breathe normally now.“Breath has been ignored by the general public,” Dr Belisa Vranich says. I suppose she would say that: a child psychologist by training, she now works at the Ash Center in New York, an “integrative and functional medicine” practice, where she teaches breathing techniques to firefighters, police officers and soldiers to help them manage stress. She now has her sights on the general breathing public. “Pulmonologists have been looking at severe dysfunction. Yogis have been looking at pranayama. But no one has been thinking of the average person like you and me. People are realising that they’ve been completed neglected.”She tells a respiratory version of The Fall humans used to breathe correctly. When a three-year-old breathes, their tummy goes in and out. Same with animals. But at a certain point we started breathing “vertically”. That’s how we’re designed to breathe when we face genuinely stressful situations – but not, say, when our phone pings 150 times a day. The way she describes it, we have been hit by a “perfect storm” not only are we much more sedentary, we’re also constantly responding to digital technology, a respiratory disaster. “When you’re looking at these screens, your breathing changes. You’re like an animal in stalking mode. And, if you notice, you’re spending all day taking incredibly small breaths. The only time you’re really breathing is when you take a big, expansive sigh.” Breathing properly, she maintains, is the single most important intervention you can make for your own health. Cheap, too.Breathing is automatic and not automatic at the same time. Respiratory function is controlled in the brain stem, the part of the brain that controls the basic things that keep us alive, like a heartbeat. You still breathe when you’re unconscious, asleep or anaesthetised. But, in some ways, it’s closer to somatic functions (such as walking) than autonomic, involuntary functions (such as sweating). You don’t have to think about each step you take, you just head somewhere. Your brain automatically adjusts your steps, just as your brain will occasionally insert a sigh when it needs more oxygen. But you can also decide to hold your breath, hyperventilate or, as the more out-there breathwork practitioners promise, use your breath “to journey between the conscious and unconscious mind”.When I first became conscious of my breathing, aged five or so – about the time Dr Vranich thinks we start doing it wrong – I remember experiencing a childhood version of an existential crisis. What if I forget to breathe? Sometimes, I’d catch myself not breathing and worry. Not without reason: I used to faint frequently due to a lack of oxygen in the brain. But somehow I went through the next few decades barely thinking about it, until one Sunday morning last year when I went to report on a communal exercise class on a basketball court in Runyon Canyon, LA, hosted by a group of wellness bros who call themselves the Wildfire Initiative.I was expecting a gruelling session of weights, cardio, humiliation. In fact, it was quite pleasant. The instructor, Bryan Ellis, a singer-songwriter with a face tattoo and a messianic demeanour, told us that since he was “lazy as fuck”, he had finessed his exercise routines right down to the two essentials: walking and breathing. He asked us to lie down and put us through a breathing exercise in which we hyperventilated, then held our collective breath.“I want you to notice that point of anxiety,” Ellis said as we lay under the sun. “Because that feeling of anxiety we get when we realise we need more air is very similar to that feeling of anxiety we get 100 times a day from the littlest thing. This feeling is natural in life-or-death situations, like when we can’t breathe. Not when our phone has died.” I expected to faint, but I felt fantastic. As we hiked up the canyon, Ellis told me that he can hold his breath for six minutes, despite smoking 10 cigarettes a day.I later discovered that his teachings are a loosely modified version of Wim Hof’s patented Method (known as WHM), which has gained a cult following among bodybuilders, athletes and celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom. Hof is also known as the Ice Man, which comes from his penchant for encasing himself in ice, swimming under bits of the Arctic and climbing up mountains in shorts. (He made it up Kilimanjaro, but didn’t quite manage Everest.) He holds 26 world records for withstanding extreme temperatures, partly thanks to his breathing technique, and runs retreats in Holland, Poland and Spain he also sells online courses, while giving away the basics free in his app.“The autonomic nervous system! The endocrine system! The lymphatic system! The immune system! The vascular system!” he declaims when I Skype him in Holland. “According to science, humans couldn’t actively influence any of these. But we have shown that you can tap into them.” Just by breathing? “Yes! That’s why we made a T-shirt that says: ‘BREATHE MOTHERFUCKER!’” He bursts out laughing. “It’s so good, because it’s so simple!”His thesis is that modern humans live in a comfort zone that’s slowly killing us (and also making us fat: you burn many more calories in the cold). Our ancestors used to be fine mooching around the tundra in loincloths. But as humans have learned to control our environments – with central heating, insulation, coats and so on – we are losing our ability to respond to nature.There’s no doubt Hof is a peculiar inidual. But while he is what you might call “conspiracy minded”, he is careful not to position his method as any kind of substitute for conventional medicine. And there is some evidence that he may be on to something. The American author Scott Carney set out to debunk Hof’s methods for his 2017 book What Doesn’t Kill Us, but ended up broadly convinced. The most credible evidence came in 2014, when a team of researchers at Radboud University in Nijmegen in the Netherlands studied 12 subjects who had followed the Wim Hof Method and found they had an increased ability to resist infection and fight inflammation. The researchers concluded that this had “important implications” for the treatment of diseases that involve excessive inflammation, especially autoimmune diseases. It was a small sample, and it remains to be seen whether it’s the cold exposure or the breathing that’s the crucial factor, but there are a number of further medical trials under way across the world.Still, the notion that breathing is good for you is one of the least controversial things you could say about the human body . “All chronic pain, suffering, and disease are caused by a lack of oxygen at the cell level,” wrote Dr Arthur C Guyton in his Textbook Of Medical Physiology in 1956, one of the world’s most widely used medical primers. “Proper breathing nourishes the cells of the body with oxygen and optimises the functioning of the body on all levels.” Studies have shown that conscious breathing exercises such as the 4-7-8 (breathe in for four, hold for seven, out for eight) are beneficial for a wide variety of conditions. Conscious breathing activates the body’s relaxation response, which in turn reduces blood pressure, which in turn lowers the risk of stroke and improves cardiovascular health. It’s also good for digestion and general immunity, both of which are impaired by stress. Similar techniques are at the heart of hypnobirthing classes, which are becoming increasingly popular. As long as you don’t expect breathing alone to cure you, it probably won’t hurt you.A little more on the edge are the consciousness-altering breathing techniques adapted from various Buddhist practices by the psychedelic pioneer Stanislav Grof at the Esalen Institute in California in the 1960s – now seeing a comeback as part of a wider psychedelic renaissance. Essentially, Grof learned how to induce “natural” psychedelic states through controlled hyperventilation. The author Michael Pollan tries out one such technique, holotropic breathwork, in his new book How To Change Your Mind, and pictures himself on a horse, galloping through a forest, “absorbing the animal’s power”, before returning to normal consciousness to find his heartbeat is all over the place. Holotropic breathwork is not recommended if you have prior heart conditions, as Pollan had. But that hasn’t stopped it gaining popularity in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond.A British entrepreneur, Poppy Jamie, 28, tells me she was so inspired by the holotropic breathing workshop she attended in LA that she decided to reassess her whole career. “We were in this room of 40 people, all hyperoxygenated. And it was such a release, I cried for two hours afterwards.”She decided to “pivot” away from her online accessories brand and concentrate on her wellness app, Happy Not Perfect, which offers a series of exercises and techniques designed to help stressed-out young millennials cope with their hyperconnected lives – a tech-on-tech solution. When she conducted focus groups, Jamie says, the breathing exercises were the most popular part of the app: “My generation found it really difficult to ‘think of nothing’ and ‘meditate’, but breathwork was something they could focus on and feel the physical effects of immediately.” She sees it as being a bit like yoga or mindfulness, but without the complicated bits. “I think more and more people need to hear about breathing. It grounds you in the present moment. In my dreams, there would be a breathing centre on every street corner.”Intrigued, I visit a breathwork practitioner named Federica Ferro at her home in London. She used to work in fashion in Milan and New York, but became disillusioned. On holiday in Mykonos, she decided to submit to a “rebirthing” at the hands of Katia Boustani, the founder of an initiative called Global Breathing Awareness. This is described as a “safe and natural breathing method which connects us with our subconscious mind”. The idea is not to pause between exhaling and inhaling, so every time you breathe out you cut it a little short and breathe in again. This induces a trance-like state in which the conscious mind quietens down, apparently allowing the subconscious to do a little rewiring.Her own first experience was life-changing. “At some point, everything that was in my mind started to dissolve, almost like I was detaching from my thoughts,” Ferro says. “Then I started to laugh. It came up through me and I felt this spiritual liberation. After a while, I saw galaxies, darkness, stars, and felt this sense of belonging. I had this incredible peace of mind. But it wasn’t just my mind. It was my body, my breath, all of my dimensions: everything. And it lasted for quite a while.” When she emerged an hour later, she tried to explain what had happened. “Katia told me, ‘Well, you’ve had what we call a cosmic orgasm.’” Ferro decided to become an instructor herself, performing rebirthing work for private clients at her home.“So what do you want from your rebirthing session?” she asks me as I lie on her bedroom floor. A cosmic orgasm? Instead, I get a sort of waking trance. After a few preliminary deep breaths, Ferro instructs me to breathe in and out on her instruction, establishing a deliberate rhythm. “When you inhale, you can think you’re breathing in everything you need: love, compassion… The exhale corresponds to the surrender, the letting go of everything you don’t need.”At first, I find it sort of stressful. It takes a lot of effort to breathe in and out to someone else’s command. But before long, my mind wanders away from my tangle of deadlines and errands to some other zone. Time bends a little. I emerge after what feels like 10 minutes but is actually an hour. I feel refreshed. Clear-headed. I didn’t quite experience what she experienced, but perhaps the cosmos wasn’t willing. Ferro writes me a list of things I should take from the experience: “I now give myself permission to prosper and flourish in all areas of my life. It is safe to feel all my emotion and let my heart guide me.”I’m not holding my breath.Put one hand on your belly and one on your chest, between your collar bones. Breathe slowly and deeply from the diaphragm. Your belly should expand in an exaggerated way on the inhale, your top hand should be still. This is the sort of “horizontal” breath you should aim for.Now do it “wrong” to feel the contrast. Breathe upwards into the chest, so your top hand moves but your bottom hand is still. This is the “vertical” breathing you should try to eliminate.Exercise 1Perch on the edge of a chair with your back straight. Breathe through your mouth. On the inhale, lean forward while expanding the belly. On the exhale, contract the belly as you lean back – breathe out until you are completely empty. Repeat 20 times. The movement should help situate the breath low in the body.Exercise 2Lie on your back and place a large book on your belly. Take a deep belly breath so it rises up in your peripheral vision. Repeat 50 times, adding heavier books. This will strengthen your core breathing muscles.

She slept on a friend’s sofa in Palo Alto and wrote “lovely letters” to Apple, Google and other digital behemoths, looking for a job. She had studied fashion design but not long into her degree realised it wasn’t for her. It was while she was an intern at Vogue in New York that she had an even bigger revelation. “I was working on vogue, and discovered that you can translate something so rich in print into something even more beautiful online.” That was the point, she says, when she fell in love with digital.But Silicon Valley wasn’t as welcoming as she’d hoped. “Vogue means nothing out here,” she laughs. “Most people see fashion as frivolous and feminine – it’s so frustrating. But I thought, I’m going to make them care about it.”The only company to reply to her letters was a shopping app called Shopkick. Röehrs took a job there and moved to San Francisco. “It’s much cheaper than Palo Alto, which I found culturally vanilla, not very stimulating.” Six years later, she has just joined Rothy’s, a company that makes women’s shoes from recycled plastic bottles, as art director. But it’s the modest fame she’s found online that has propelled her career in a way she never expected.Röehrs lives in Hayes Valley, an artistic, creative neighbourhood of San Francisco. It was once partly covered by an elevated motorway, the Central Freeway, which was seriously demolished after an earthquake in 1989. Almost overnight, Hayes Valley was transformed into a bustling, walkable part of town. Its powerful residents’ association has banned almost all chain companies, resulting in an inevitable imbalance: you can pop out for a deconstructed vintage shift dress but not a pint of milk. “It’s wonderful: no Starbucks, and so many great independent shops,” says Röehrs, “but it’s impossible to find a good grocery store.” The modern, three-storey apartment building where she lives with her partner, Jeremy, and their two dogs is built in a gap where the freeway once stood. Inside, it’s a warm jumble of antiques, books, artworks and plants – the latter something of an obsession – that belie the modern surroundings. The large canvases, mostly portraits in oil, are by Röehrs. “I haven’t sold a single one, so our home serves as a pop-up gallery.”A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf is artfully messy, with titles displayed at all angles. Next to it is an industrial grey wall – actually a cement support beam left bare. An Eero Saarinen oval dining table is from Craigslist, surrounded by mismatched vintage chairs and stools. “I love colour and excess. I’m the complete opposite of a minimalist,” she says. Most of the antiques in the apartment are Jeremy’s. “He’s from a classical home, and had a proper upbringing with real silver and china,” she smiles. “We have a lot of heirloom pieces from his family.”A previously “dark, dead hallway” now has a well-lit gallery hang of artwork – a mixture of friends’ pieces, photographs by Jeremy, and Röehrs’ own “scribbles” and paintings. Plants are everywhere, including a pair of magnificent fiddle-leaf figs standing watch over the sofa. “I know they’re going out of style, but they’re so beautiful,” she says. “I’m trying to replicate a jungle in our apartment. I end up making my way to Flora Grubb (the only plant shop in San Francisco you need to know) and getting another plant. We look after our plants and dogs as if they were our children.”With the success of her “edibles” and her new job, “which is finally, properly in fashion”, Röehrs feels like life is starting to settle into place. “Growing up, I always wanted my surroundings to reflect who I am. Now they finally do.”• Edible Ensembles: A Fashion Feast For The Eyes, by Gretchen Röehrs, is published by Rizzoli priced at £18.95.

At around the same time, a Japanese seed scientist crossed Chinese kale with broccoli to produce a new vegetable in which the stem is as delicious as the tip. It was named Tenderstem. Today’s dish brings together these two plant-based creations – and it makes me wonder: what could we be eating in another few years’ time?White miso is a genius ingredient that makes almost anything it touches taste ine, because it instantly adds bagfuls of umami. It’s also not as obscure as you might think: many supermarkets now stock it as a matter of course, and it’s also readily available online.

We’re all familiar with boiling grains and serving them with a rich sauce or stew on top, but there’s a lot to be said for cooking them in the sauce itself, so the grains soak up the richness and, in the process, thicken the liquid.

Giant couscous is widely available, but if you can’t get hold of it, use a small pasta such as fregola or orzo instead. 350g cherry tomatoes 65ml olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tsp caraway seeds, lightly crushed in a mortar1 tsp tomato paste1kg squid tubes, cleaned and cut into 1.5cm rounds100ml dry white wine1 tbsp caster sugar1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes 20g coriander leaves (about 2 tbsp), roughly choppedSalt and pepper100g giant couscous2 tsp rose harissa1 small shallot, peeled and finely chopped ½ tbsp cider vinegar70g pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped1 tbsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed in a mortar1 tsp grated lemon zestToss the cherry tomatoes in a teaspoon of oil, to coat. Put a large saute pan on a high heat and, once very hot, add the tomatoes and fry, stirring gently, for five minutes, until their skins are charred and blistered. Transfer to a plate and wipe the pan clean.Turn the heat to medium-high, add two tablespoons of oil and the onion to the same pan, and cook until softened and lightly browned – about seven minutes. Add the garlic, caraway and tomato paste, and cook, stirring, for a minute, until fragrant. Add the squid and wine, cook for seven minutes, then stir in the sugar, tinned tomatoes, three-quarters of the fresh coriander, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a good grind of pepper.

The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Throughout his career, Murray has pushed himself to the absolute physical limit. Three grand slam titles, two gold medals, Davis Cup, the No 1 ranking and a total of 45 titles is an incredible reward for his efforts.But it has taken its toll. At 31, and after hip surgery in January, Murray knows that understanding his limits is even more crucial than ever. So, after a gruelling, emotional four days in Washington on his latest comeback, his decision to quit before his quarter-final must be viewed as part of the bigger picture.Likewise, his decision to pull out of the Rogers Cup in Toronto, a Masters 1000 event that begins on Monday, is sensible. Having not played since Eastbourne, the week before Wimbledon, Murray probably did not expect to do as well as he did in Washington. As he continues his recovery, planning, scheduling and patience will be every bit as important as technique and mental strength in battle. He will now head to Cincinnati to prepare early for his first Masters 1000 event in 15 months, starting a week on Monday. All being well, he will then be ready for the next step up, best-of-five-set matches at the US Open, which begins on 27 August.Murray will have learned a lot from the past few days. Just getting to the last eight of the Citi Open was a huge achievement. Three matches in four days, in the heat and humidity of the American capital, will have tested his right hip to the extreme. Beating Kyle Edmund in three sets on Wednesday will have boosted his confidence but outlasting the Romanian Marius Copil the next night, in a match that finished at 3am, just about did him in.As it turned out, Murray’s scheduled quarter-final against Alex de Minaur would have been held over to Saturday because of rain. But though the extra time might have allowed Murray to be competitive, the prospect of playing two matches in one day is not something that he would have enjoyed.Off the Tour for 11 months, and after the second surgery of his career following his back operation in 2013, Murray must have feared he would never be able to play at this level again. In Washington, though his movement was not yet back to its absolute best, he was straining every sinew to chase every ball.What should we make of his latest comeback? The signs are encouraging and he is improving match on match. Whereas at Queen’s and Eastbourne he looked like he was being careful not to push himself too much, especially when running wide on the forehand, in Washington he threw himself around the court. After a patchy performance in the first round, when he admitted he was a little passive, he attacked against Edmund, stepping into returns and trying to dictate. His serve, too, slipped into rhythm when he needed it and he was mentally strong.Playing three-hour epics, day in day out, is the job of a younger man, preferably one with no hip problems. Murray does not have a Roger Federer-style serve or a Rafael Nadal forehand that can destroy opponents in a single stroke his success has been built on an all-round game backed up by outstanding athleticism. But when he was looking to make the step up to become a grand slam champion, he realised he needed to attack. Now, with his body talking loudly to him, shortening points would help again.What Murray will never lack is heart. Having begun Washington as the world No\u0026nbsp832, his efforts have already taken him up to 375. If there is a way back to the top, there can be no doubt that he has the will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30793c5914c4225d31be027b9e44ccc18b0a39ed/0_94_3407_2045/master/3407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfcf67af64b30699c019f73dda4cae00","title":"england india ben stokes joe root sam curran","story":"Ben Stokes spoke of his pride at playing for his country following a spell of match-winning brilliance that offered the latest reminder of what England will be missing come Thursday’s second Test at Lord’s.The all-rounder powered Joe Root’s side to a 1-0 series lead over India at Edgbaston with a stirring three-wicket burst that included the prized pelt of Virat Kohli but now sits out the second instalment given his long-awaited trial for affray that begins in Bristol on Monday.Interviewed by Sky after the 31-run win, sealed when he had Hardik Pandya caught at first slip, Stokes said: “I’m just so proud to be a part of this group and playing for England. We’ll take a lot of confidence from winning into the rest of this series.”“We’ve had a lot of stick recently so to beat a team like India will hopefully close some mouths.”Victory in the 1,000th Test played by England represents the highlight of Joe Root’s 18 months in charge and the captain praised Stokes for putting his court case to one side during the match the challenge now is for others to step up in his absence.Root said: “Stokes has gone about things exactly how he has in every other game. And I don’t see that ever changing. When he turns up to practice or puts on an England shirt he’s so dedicated to this group of players and whatever happens, going forward he’s going to be a big part of this dressing room.”How England replace Stokes remains to be seen with Root stating he will not discuss the next squad with the selectors until the emotion of the first Test has passed. Chris Woakes, fit again after quad and knee injuries, should receive the call for Thursday’s Test at Lord’s, while Dawid Malan, fresh from exorcising some of his demons at second slip by holding the first catch of England’s final victory push, could yet earn a reprieve to avoid further disruption.One player who also demonstrated his all-round prowess was Sam Curran, who, after five wickets in the Test and a game-shifting 63 in England’s second innings, was duly named man of the match in his second appearance little wonder Root sees shades of his talisman in the 20-year-old.The England captain said: “Whenever you watch him operate on the field he has this desire and steeliness within him and, similar to Ben, he wants to be involved in the big occasions – that obviously suits Test cricket.“To come into his second Test match under pressure and against the No 1 team in the world and play like that … it’s very exciting for us as a side. That should fill him with huge confidence for the rest of this series.”Curran shared his admiration for Stokes’s passion, something he is looking to emulate, and on his second-innings heroics with the bat – a show of serious chutzpah that gave England a defendable lead – he said: “I was trying not to think about the occasion. I just wanted to play my natural game, like I have been doing for Surrey.“I’m the type of person who just tries to do that and not worry about what people think – and I’m lucky enough a few balls came out of the middle..”Kohli lamented his team’s batting – having scored 200 of their 436 runs in his two innings the India captain was well within his rights to do so – and was impressed by England’s spirit in a rollercoaster of a Test match.He said: “England were relentless and they made us work very hard for our runs. Our shot selection could have been better. We definitely need to apply ourselves better with the bat, but England came back superbly. We need to think how to regroup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3334d8873e9ac5c03018e358244e6069d9728632/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5576b507b83d0762a7927aa7be8bfffc","title":"european championships adam peaty world record gold","story":"Like the Greatest Showman he is, Adam Peaty stepped into the spotlight of the European Championships on Saturday and delivered a performance that merited top billing, powering his way to gold in the 100m breaststroke at Tollcross.With a world record of precisely 57 seconds, another 13-hundredths stripped off a mark that he has pecked away at like a ravenous woodpecker, it was another astonishing evening in a life less ordinary.Maddening too, in a peculiar way, for the 23-year-old. He has long coveted the realisation of his Project 56, to be the first to swim his prime event in 56 seconds and whatever. One day very soon, you suspect. More likely, when there is a semblance of opposition clipping near his quicksilver heels.James Wilby, his GB teammate, was second but seemingly an ocean adrift. Peaty turned in 26.65 but ignited what he lovingly refers to as his afterburners. An aquatic patch of scorched earth was left behind as muscular shoulders and super-human legs propelled him towards one more slice of history. Yet he said: “It’s a weird one. Honestly, I wasn’t going out to do a world record.”Casual as you like. And it makes one wonder what a fully motivated, fully honed, fully emoted Peaty might accomplish at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. He had marked himself as a mere eight-out-of-ten coming in. The Europeans, where he first claimed a world record, holds a special place in his heart. This was his 10th continental title. Validation for a hard summer’s work.However, Japan is his rising sun and his moon. This is merely a fuelling stop on his rocket-propelled trip there. Better, he mischievously said grinning, to have been denied that miniscule moment faster, “because that gives me another level of motivation”.“If I’d got 56.99, I’d have been “oh, for God’s sake.’ I’d have achieved it and people would all have been talking about Project 55. It’s a great place to be. Break the world record by a marginal gain.“Two years out, it leaves me and Great Britain in a great place. You see Wilby down that last 50 and you’re looking at a very strong 100 breast. That’s the most important thing, that we can take on the world in the breaststroke. And if we can take that into the relay, even better. Who knows what can happen?”He still has the 50m breaststroke to come here. Perhaps another chunk off another of his global bests. And then some more. “Hopefully, I’ve still got another 10 years left in the sport,” he said. Chastened, usefully, with the rupture of a four-year streak of victories at April’s Commonwealth Games, the fires are burning ominously.“When you go four years without losing, you get complacent. Even if you don’t want to admit it to yourself. That team around you tries to keep you on track. There are a few ups and downs. But it’s great to have that close-knit family. It’s not just my performance. It’s my team’s and that spider web of support.”For Wilby, it was the second time he had followed Peaty home in one of these journeys into the record books. Silver was no bad consolation in this company. “It’s good to see a teammate do well,” he said. “We’re both based in Loughborough on a daily basis and it’s good to see him putting in good performances. Seeing him do that does motivate me but inidually we’ve all got our own targets.”There was bronze for the British squad of Stephen Milne, Craig McLean, Kat Greenslade and Freya Anderson in the new 4x200 mixed freestyle relay. James Guy took second place in his 200m butterfly semi-final to advance into Sunday’s final while the Commonwealth champion, Duncan Scott, was the fifth-quickest in the 100m freestyle semis.Siobhan-Marie O’Connor will vie for a medal in the unfamiliar surroundings of the women’s 100m breaststroke and Georgia Davies of Wales broke the European 50m backstroke record in the morning heats with a swim of 27.21sec but eased leisurely into the final.“I won’t underestimate my competition,” said Davies. “The field is really strong. The 50 is such a close race and one tiny mistake means you can lose everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce53c75fbea2e9604e8b754cbe336706abf7790/44_81_2722_1633/master/2722.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58aa1c948af5c79f8bdeea99b44642a","title":"hockey womens world cup ireland","story":"Ireland secured a second consecutive shootout victory to book their place in the final of the Hockey World Cup in London.After a 1-1 draw with Spain at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Ireland won the shootout 3-2, with Gillian Pinder scoring twice as the contest went to sudden death.Ireland have been the surprise package of the tournament after going in as the second lowest-ranked team then topping a group containing the hosts, England, and India.They made a dream start to the semi-final, with Anna O’Flanagan touching in a penalty corner after only three minutes.

That the 22-year-old responded so strongly from her first bogey illustrated a competitive spirit that will be necessary if Hall is to win her first major title on Sunday.Hall’s dropped shot at the 13th was offset – and more – by birdies at the 15th and 16th. After handing another stroke back to the course, at the 17th, Hall again fought back she birdied the closing hole. A third round of 69, Hall’s third sub-70 score in succession, leaves her one from the lead as held by Pornanong Phatlum with a round to play.Hall, who was third in the British Open a year ago, is seeking to become the third home winner since the tournament was afforded major status in 2001.“Today was harder than the first two days,” she said. “My long game wasn’t quite on but I putted very well. I’m in a similar position to last year and hopefully I’ll be a bit more relaxed this time.”Phatlum, who spent the day in Hall’s company, also signed for a 69 in moving to 13 under. The Thai has dropped one shot in the entire event, at the 12th in round three. She could become the third player from her home country to win a LPGA‑sanctioned event in three weeks, a statistic that endorses the strength of the game there. How will Phatlum keep calm in the frenzy? “I sing to myself,” she said.Ryu So-yeon has been perfectly open about her desire to claim a grand slam of major championships. Two of the five were already banked before Ryu was defeated in a play-off at the Women’s PGA Championship last month.The 28-year-old Korean was a factor in this tournament even before a third-round 67, which raised her to within two of the lead. Even more notable was that Ryu was two over par after four holes.“Sometimes it’s just better not to expect anything,” said Ryu of her strategy for Sunday. “I’ll just focus on what I can do, instead of predicting what’s going on.“I’m in pretty good position. If I can have this attitude tomorrow as well, I can play good.”This is quite the congested 54-hole scene. Minjee Lee, Mamiko Higa and Park Sung-Hyun sit at 10 under. A significant aspect of this major has been the lack of links wind a scenario which appears unlikely to change.Ariya Jutanugarn’s third round of 69 means she is not entirely out of the picture at minus six. Nonetheless, the world No 1 needs heroics – and favours from those higher up the leaderboard – if she is to prevail here. Lydia Ko is a stroke better off following her 70.Catriona Matthew, the champion at Lytham in 2009, cut a rueful figure after adding a 72 to rounds of 71 and 70. “I probably played my best golf of the week,” said the Scot. “Crazy game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb098674a785400b16b2cbca41013fa1c15ab0e/0_686_1400_839/master/1400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ad0ddc26438ff525af35472cc5d7eb6","title":"beverley knight defends her casting as emmeline pankhurst","story":"The singer is to play the suffragette leader at the Old Vic theatre in SeptemberBeverley Knight has hit out at critics of her casting as Emmeline Pankhurst in a new musical by pointing to the ubiquity of white actors playing characters of other ethnicities.Knight will play the leader of the British suffragette movement, with Genesis Lynea taking the titular role of Sylvia Pankhurst, Emmeline’s daughter, in the play, which opens next month at the Old Vic theatre.Responding to a detractor on Twitter who suggested that she did not have the right skin colour for the role, Knight tweeted: Following in the footsteps of Hamilton, a hip-hop retelling of the life of the American founding father Alexander Hamilton, Sylvia tells the story of the campaign for women’s suffrage through a combination of dance, hip-hop, soul and funk. On BBC One’s The One Show on Wednesday, Knight said that the casting of Sylvia was a reflection of progress in theatre. “It’s just interesting that 100 years later, here’s me as a black woman playing the role of someone who was white. “It’s just kind of marking the direction of where theatre is going – the ersity, the inclusivity, and the fact that the music is much more street and modern and contemporary. I think Emmeline would like it.“Most of the show is sung. It’s at the Old Vic, so people who go and see shows at the Old Vic would expect something a little more traditional. This is anything but. I’m not rapping, but I am speaking rhythmically as well as singing the way that people know me to sing.“There’s a lot of hip-hop, there’s a lot of R\u0026ampB, there’s a lot of funk. It’s telling this seismic story in a really fresh way. It’s glorious, it really is.”Written by Kate Prince and Priya Parmar, with original music by Josh Cohen and DJ Walde, Sylvia tells the story of the sometimes difficult relationship between the Pankhursts. In an earlier interview, Prince, whose company ZooNation will produce the piece, said: “Politics and families are a tricky combination, and in the case of the Pankhursts, it severed ties between them. Ultimately we are telling the story of the price each of the Pankhurst family paid for their political purpose.”Sylvia is at the Old Vic from 3-22 September.

Even the children say they like him. He is attentive, patient and game for a laugh. But whether he knows it or not, he is also a man whose middle-class privilege puts him in control. In a play that inhabits grey areas, his well-intentioned attempts to do the right thing can also look like interfering. It just depends on whether your perspective is from the top down or the bottom up.What he has on his side is language. Instead of “gap”, he goes for “disparity” he speaks with ease of “percentiles”. No problem if you speak the jargon. If not, it is the language of exclusion. Reacting to a volley of abuse from an angry Brian, McCafferty has some justification in saying the language used is “not acceptable for this meeting” – except it reinforces the idea that the only acceptable language is his.This parents’ meeting, ostensibly to discuss the unsteady progress of Donna and Brian’s son Jayden – they might call it a problem with reading and writing McCafferty talks about literacy and learning differences – turns into a territorial war of attrition. Thanks to their experiences of being educated in the same school, Donna and Brian have learned to be suspicious of any intervention that could disadvantage Jayden. They know what it’s like to be rejected, undermined and relegated to the back of the class, and instinctively resist any proposal that could harm their son in the same way.The play doesn’t make it easy the issues of addiction, neglect and broken families that creep into this classroom in a deprived area of Dublin are none of the teacher’s doing. He’s just a small cog in a wider systemic failure – and it is a system that ultimately fails him, too. The play stops short of apportioning blame – nobody comes out of it well – in preference to exploring the uncertain territory where prejudice, damage and failed intentions collide. Directed by the playwrights, Class is tremendously acted in a series of fast-cut scenes that chop between the parents’ evening and the homework club where Jayden and his classmate Kaylie try in vain to make up for lost time. Doubling roles, Morris and Jones capture the children’s combination of physical freedom and emotional vulnerability just as they strike a perfect balance of defensiveness and anger in the adults. There are no answers in this classroom, but many provocative questions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c5efafcd0d5d02b07bc79a220eed4431f875a41/0_279_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c53585331df6813088da53dfb8771e97","title":"on the exhale review traverse edinburgh festival 2018 polly frame martin zimmerman","story":"Traverse, EdinburghAs a bereaved mother, Polly Frame is consumed by thoughts of revenge as Martín Zimmerman’s mesmerising tale of a school massacre hits homeIn the Alice in Wonderland logic of the National Rifle Association, “guns don’t kill people, people do”. It’s an aphorism that pretends to be revelatory but is actually the opposite. At best it is a deflection, at worst irresponsible. The 7,074 people who died in US shootings in the first half of this year do not have the privilege of debating whether they were slaughtered by man or machine. As Eddie Izzard once said, “I think the gun helps.”Martín Zimmerman’s On the Exhale, first seen in 2017 and now given its UK premiere in a focused production by Christopher Haydon for China Plate and Audible, is an attempt to get under the skin of a debate that tells you more about America’s fraught relationship with its history and constitution than it does about reasoned argument. In this story about a bereaved mother reeling from the shock of a school massacre, assault rifle and shooter merge to become one and the same. The gun is an extension of the person carrying it.As the playwright presents it, the student with a pistol under his belt is transformed. Typically, the weapon takes wounded male privilege (because it is so often thus) and replaces it with power. It’s a power that imbalances every relationship. No one will contradict, still less confront, the person in the room with the capacity to gun you down.Dreaming of taking revenge after the shooting, the bereaved woman becomes so transfixed by the rifle she buys (a three-minute transaction requiring no more than a driver’s license) that it becomes a living presence. Venturing into the heart of darkness, she realises she “can’t be trusted to control herself around machines of such seductive power”.Performed in a country where the gun lobby has no sway, the play risks simply confirming our guns-are-bad prejudices. It sidesteps this thanks to the intensity of Zimmerman’s second-person script, which never takes you quite where you expect, and the mesmerising performance of Polly Frame. Still, matter-of-fact and measured, her delivery is gripping in its economy and hits home like a bullet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1115fd72c370dc21e54a60a8eb741f8b973facd7/0_181_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1770b41226ac17598b95eb2bc88e66dc","title":"the greatest play in the history of the world review julie hesmondhalgh traverse edinburgh kershaw","story":"Traverse, EdinburghJulie Hesmondhalgh’s superb turn as narrator lights up these comic tales about the universal significance of loveIn festivals past, the Traverse has showcased a beguiling series of monologues by Daniel Kitson. At their best, they were masterpieces of daring storytelling that painted the small details of everyday lives with such care they seemed to take on universal weight.To see Kitson this year, you have to stay up late for a sold-out run at the Stand comedy club, but the Traverse is satisfying the need for the romantic and the whimsical – with a side helping of cosmic significance – in Ian Kershaw’s science-fiction fantasy about an apparently accidental romance that turns out to have been written in the stars.As the Voyager space probes venture into the solar system carrying Carl Sagan’s recoded anthology of human culture (“People having a good time. People cramming it all in”), we find ourselves among the ordinary shops and houses of a certain Preston Road where, one morning at 4.40am, time has inexplicably stood still. That’s when the directionless Tom wakes up and, having inadvertently caught the eye of his neighbour Sara across the street, decides to write a play called The Greatest Play in the History of the World … Meanwhile, another set of neighbours are embarking on a scientific adventure that will draw him and Sara eternally together.If the piece doesn’t quite achieve the shiver-down-the-spine resonance it aspires to, straining a little too hard to turn the Voyager journeys into a metaphor for universal love, it is nonetheless a funny and charming tapestry of tales that holds your imagination before it reveals its time-travelling secrets.What makes it special, in Raz Shaw’s good-looking production, is the superb performance of Julie Hesmondhalgh as the unnamed narrator, meticulously colouring in the stories of neighbours, friends and love rivals whom she identifies by the footwear she finds in the shoeboxes of Naomi Kuyck Cohen’s set – and also by the shoes she borrows from a willing audience. Looking us in the eye, the Coronation Street and Broadchurch star gives a big-hearted performance that is as warm and generous as it is precise in its narrative control.

One moment he’s in casual repose on the floor, looking earthbound and ordinary, the next he has weightlessly transitioned into a b-boy freeze, suspending his bodyweight on one arm, his legs knotted above his head or split like compass needles. Moments like these are exhilarating to behold, but the thrill soon subsides. For all Iduozee’s obvious facility, his feats of spiralling speed and precision are overshadowed by a frustrating tendency to crouch in the corner, occasionally flicking beads of sweat off his pate into the footlights. He may well be generating profound thoughts at this point, but it doesn’t really translate. An unfortunate sense of self-indulgence settles over proceedings (the piece’s grandiosely meta name doesn’t help matters).The fitfulness of the physicality is exacerbated by the weirdly patchy nature of the sound design. Initial bursts of thrumming electronica and crackling feedback have the awkward, glitchy quality of a school PA system on the blink, so it’s a relief when clacking typewriter keys and watery gushing sounds take over.

The property was locked up and unattended. Calls to the owners went unanswered, and they\u0026nbspcould not get through to Airbnb. Unable to find anywhere else\u0026nbspto stay and with the night closing in, the White family were forced to spend the first night of their holiday trying to catch a few hours sleep in their small hire car.“We had no reply from the host or Airbnb to repeated phone calls, so we slept in the car until we found emergency accommodation,” says White. “Due to the late notice and the need to rent a new three bed villa the cost to us far exceeded the original cost.”The only villa they were able to find at short notice was available for just one night – at a cost of €395 (£350) – and then they had to move and unpack again 24 hours later. After that, they were able to find a villa for the rest of their holiday, but in total they were £1,700 out of pocket.Eventually, Damian was able to get through to Airbnb. It apologised, and said the behaviour of the missing host was unacceptable. It offered to refund the original £514.93 the family had paid for the villa and gave them a $50 (£38) coupon to be used against a future Airbnb booking. But that was it – there was no offer to refund the huge extra expense they had suffered.Damian was furious. Their holiday had been ruined, they had to pay out huge amounts for a new villa, and been forced to sleep in a car.It didn’t help that Airbnb’s customer service response was gushingly inappropriate. “I hope you’re having a wonderful afternoon\u0026nbspso far,” Airbnb said in an email to Damian as he was in the midst of sorting out the disaster. “Thank you so much for being an Awesome Airbnb User Damian and have a great day!” it added.While still abroad, Damian decided to show how awesome he was by demanding that Airbnb pay up for the holiday. He emailed Airbnb: “I’m very disappointed no one has contacted me in three days and left us to fend for ourselves. You have a responsibility towards your customers which you have not shown to us. I shall be opening a case on our return and writing to as many consumer champions as I can so that this incident and your lack of any kind of help receives a larger audience.”Damian carried out his threat, issuing proceedings in the small claims court as soon as he returned – notwithstanding what he says was Airbnb’s initial refusal to give him an address for a summons “due to security”. Damian estimated his loss to be a total of £1,464, taking into account the refund of the £514 and including £70 for the court fees.The legal threat worked miraculously well. Damian issued the summons on 17 July, and just four days later Airbnb agreed to pay\u0026nbspout his full claim.“We note that in your case, you have been refunded the full value of the reservation, £514.93 We do acknowledge that the level of service provided by Airbnb customer service fell short of our standards and your expectations. In the interests of bringing this matter to a close swiftly, Airbnb is prepared as a gesture of goodwill, and without any admission of liability, to offer you a goodwill payment of £1,464.91, the full value of the claim, including the\u0026nbspcost involved in filing this county\u0026nbspcourt claim.”The lesson from Damian’s experience? Use the government’s Money Claim Online service – it’s relatively simple, and you can reclaim court fees if your claim is\u0026nbspsuccessful.I lost £3,175 on a booking –only through the  have I now got it backJonathan Dooley, 35, from London, planned a fabulous group holiday with 13 friends from all over the world, booking a seven-bed villa just outside Palma, Majorca, at £455 a night. Everyone booked their flights – some arriving from the US, some from Germany, others from the UK – but shortly after booking Jonathan discovered he had been scammed. The property did not exist. It was an entirely bogus listing posted on Airbnb.“I lost £3,175 and had a group of very angry iniduals who had not only already purchased their flights but had also shopped for the holiday. I have made many holiday reservations in the past and have never been a victim of fraud.”Airbnb initially rebuffed his claim for compensation, saying he went outside its payments architecture and was dealing with the “owner” directly. Airbnb says its golden rule is that “as long as you stay on the platform and only pay via Airbnb, scams simply cannot succeed”.But Jonathan insisted that he was aware of scams, and had stayed within Airbnb’s system. He contacted  Money to press his case, with screenshot evidence of his transactions. “I was directed by the Airbnb app to contact the host to confirm the dates and proceed with the booking, and was provided with their email address as the only form of contact. The confirmation email with payment instructions and the welcome email advising that the home awaits our trip were generated through the Airbnb platform to trick me into believing they were genuine. Airbnb gave this host their stamp of approval allowing them to operate, and I strongly believe they should have taken measures to vet them to ensure their credibility and legitimacy.” Money put his case to Airbnb, which is repaying him. Its subsequent investigation found that\u0026nbspJonathan did indeed have a case. The email that Jonathan responded to on the Airbnb site was that of the fraudsters. It said that it constantly “scrubs” its website to remove such emails, but hadn’t spotted this one. It accepted that its “defences missed an email address in the listing description. We scan for this, and scrub out personal information, but clearly this example got through and we are reviewing how that happened.”Jonathan has now found another villa in Majorca, at roughly the same price though much further from the airport than the first one, where the group will meet up in two weeks’ time. “Without your help this wouldn’t have happened – so thank you very much, ,” he says.The lesson for other travellers? It’s probably a good idea to take screenshots or photographs on your phone during the booking process so that you have\u0026nbspevidence later on.A double booking and a €350 bill for ‘damage’ we knew nothing about When Bronia Kita’s university student son and four friends turned up for two nights at an Airbnb in Galway, Ireland, they were told there would be two beds plus a mattress on the floor and a private bathroom. On arrival, they found just one bed and two mattresses on the floor. They felt they had no choice but to accept. The next day, the host said she’d double booked, and they’d have to move. Eventually they were forced to share with a family staying in the same flat.“As if this weren’t bad enough, the host later texted my son, claiming the bed in their first room was broken and demanding €350 to replace it. He replied that they were not aware of any damage and requested evidence, which she did not provide,” says Bronia.Later the host provided a photograph of a piece of wood under the bed that she said had been damaged. “He reiterated that they were not aware of causing any damage, pointing out that the sum of money she was claiming was excessive and asking why the bed couldn’t be fixed. She didn’t reply and he and his friends assumed she\u0026nbspwas just trying it on.”But Airbnb emailed him 10 days later saying a complaint had been filed by the host, and that he had 72\u0026nbsphours to respond. It later upheld the complaint and took the money from one of the members of his party. Airbnb also accepted the host’s claim that seven people, not five, had come to stay, which Bronia\u0026nbspsays is absurd. “Five people stayed in the room, as per the booking, and the host could see this when she arrived to move them on.”Bronia says her son was too young\u0026nbspto battle an internet giant, so she took up the cudgels herself. But Airbnb’s dispute resolution centre – which did not accept calls – emailed that there was nothing it could do.“I must stress that we as a family and my son and friends have used Airbnb on a number of occasions in the past without encountering any problems, but I have since done some research and found that bogus claims are not uncommon – unsurprisingly, if they make it so easy. We don’t even know if the photograph was of the bed my son and his friend slept in. It could be a bed in another property, or even an image from the internet. We were shown no evidence that the bed had cost €350, either, and the website for the Dublin branch of Ikea has double bed frames starting at €75.“Clearly, Airbnb’s system for dealing with damage claims needs examining, as it is ripe for abuse: if a bogus claim is accepted on the grounds of one unauthenticated photograph, what could they do to prove their innocence?” recommends Airbnbers take pictures of the property when they leave and send them to the owner to prove it was left in good condition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0dce55b3bf77978a4759728114c9d9c5d2cba5f/0_176_3619_2171/master/3619.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db26d3b111cf0bb9546a7a8679739b58","title":"american left morality alexandria ocasio cortez bernie sanders","story":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders talk to  Sarah Smarsh about knowing what’s right from wrong After the 2016 presidential election, headlines described a “ided” United States. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – at the time a 27-year-old bartender, now a progressive political star running for US Congress after she pulled off a fantastic primary upset in New York last month – sensed an underlying problem that was deeper than politics, more personal than demographic data.“I just really felt like our country wasn’t understanding itself,” Ocasio-Cortez told me by phone while campaigning for congressional candidate Cori Bush in Missouri. “We didn’t understand each other, and we didn’t understand ourselves as a collective nation.” It was almost midnight, and her voice sounded strong but tired. Our scheduled interview the previous day, when she visited my home district in Kansas to support another progressive candidate, had been postponed as she navigated her first appearance outside New York. I had figured I wouldn’t get a call at such a late hour and had already changed into my pajamas – an awkward accident that suited the vulnerable questions I intended to ask her about, oh, the meaning of life. As Ocasio-Cortez pondered her country’s sociopolitical disconnect in late 2016, she told me, she considered her part in it. Having grown up in New York City with strong family ties in Puerto Rico, Ocasio-Cortez had limited experience of the rest of the US – not so different, she said, than growing up in a small town.That changed in late 2016 when an organizer invited her to join protest camps demonstrating against the Dakota crude oil access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.Ocasio-Cortez and a friend packed an old Subaru and drove west. “The cigarette lighter didn’t work, so we couldn’t charge our phones,” she said, recalling plugging in at rest stops as they traversed Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota. They talked with people along the way. Ocasio-Cortez recognized their class struggles, so similar to the ones she saw back in the Bronx.When they reached Standing Rock, the destination proved to be as formative as the journey. There Ocasio-Cortez witnessed a “profoundly spiritual experience.” Each night in the camps, Indigenous activists entered wigwams to sweat and pray – an ancient ritual for purification and fortification. “Native American spirituality was the lynchpin for the water protectors there,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “That is where people get the strength.”Ocasio-Cortez was inspired. The next day, when a progressive political action committee asked her to run for office – the smell of campfire smoke still in her hair, perhaps – she knew the answer was yes.What is remarkable about this story is not that she felt transformed by an event that was both political and spiritual. It is that she dares to speak of it publicly.For decades, the two wings of US politics have dealt with spirituality in opposite ways. The God-wielding right proudly trots out organized religion to defend its views, and the secular, postmodern left keeps even non-religious spiritual experiences so quiet as to imply it’s silly or shameful to have them.That dichotomy has resulted in rightwing dominance of the spiritual space in the US. It’s been nearly 40 years since Ronald Reagan stepped into the White House with fundamentalist megachurch ringleader Jerry Falwell behind him. On the surface, during that time – the “family values” platform of so many Republicans influence of Christian televangelist Pat Robertson Donald Trump’s overwhelming support by Christian evangelicals – it would appear that conservatives owned faith.But today there is a marked shift in tone on the left – a reconciliation of the public sphere with private meaning, from social-justice-driven religion to non-religious, even atheist, humanism.Places of worship have become sanctuaries for immigrants at risk of deportation pro-LGBTQ clergy have stepped forward to combat hate within their denominations a rogue group of feminist Catholics is ordaining and recognizing women as priests whether the Vatican excommunicates them or not. An extreme climate is forcing politicians to invoke the concept of right and wrong. To describe government-sanctioned separation of families at the Mexican-American border, for instance, wonky policy language does not suffice.Liberal leaders from Hillary Clinton to Van Jones to Elizabeth Warren have summoned an old-fashioned word more often associated with the right: this is, they’ve said, a moral crisis.Like Ocasio-Cortez, I am a pro-choice woman who was raised in the Catholic church. Now happily non-religious, I’m used to holding simultaneous truths that are often painted as contradictory – like, say, revering hard facts while feeling motivated by something deeper than our minds can comprehend.The Poor People’s Campaign holds that same balance. Begun by Martin Luther King Jr not long before his murder and currently revived by the Rev William Barber of North Carolina and the Rev Liz Theoharis of New York, today the movement mobilizes people of all – or no – faiths across the country to fight inequality. Leaders draw on scripture alongside statistics to call out the immorality of corporate, government and social structures in the US. Among their fans is Bernie Sanders, who was raised Jewish but isn’t actively involved in organized religion. Sanders is not one to quote scripture, but he believes ethical imperative is the foundation of serious politics.“It’s hard to imagine why anyone would be involved in politics if one didn’t have a moral sense of right and wrong, of justice and injustice,” Sanders told me by phone from Washington not long after he visited Kansas with Ocasio-Cortez.As synchronicity would have it, he had a meeting with the Rev Barber that afternoon. Their rhetoric often sounds the same.“We are not a just and moral society when three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America. As we speak this moment, you got 40 million people living in poverty. Thirty million people without any health insurance,” Sanders said. “It is racial justice. It is environmental justice. It is issues of war and peace and trying to create a peaceful world, not a world where countries are aiming nuclear missiles at each other.”Ocasio-Cortez said she’s routinely asked about her avowed democratic socialism, but that political theory is not what drives her.“A moral imperative is absolutely part of how I approach public policy. Because if it’s not there, then what does?” Ocasio-Cortez said, noting that the tattered books that most shaped her politics were written by moral leaders such as King and Howard Thurman. “Everyone’s going crazy about socialism and democratic socialism. For me, that’s not my seat. My seat is a moral seat.” She said that we have long sought to be a rich society while failing to discuss the idea of a good society.“That is why we pay people less than a living wage. That’s why we allow people to be paid starvation wages. That’s why we allow people to go bankrupt in chemotherapy. That’s why we allow people to have their home stripped by a bank that manufactured the crisis in the first place,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Those are not the markings of a good society.” Critics call progressive platforms like hers unfeasible, but Ocasio-Cortez isn’t buying it. “In a society that is materially and logistically and in every way capable of ensuring people are paid a dignified wage, have healthcare, have access to an education and opportunity – if that is materially possible,” she said, “I feel like we are morally compelled to make it so.”In her 1997 book Healing the Soul of America, re-released in revised form last month, spiritual leader Marianne Williamson described our country’s political dysfunction as symptom of a greedy society that has not yet atoned for its crimes against native and enslaved peoples, exploited laborers, women and children. She called for politicians to work for good rather than for special interests or the status quo: “A conscience-based politics cares less for political expediency than for moral truth.”Sanders has spent most of his nearly 40 years in public office shunning political expediency, whether as an independent mayor, US representative and US senator in Vermont or as an anti-Wall-Street Democrat riling up the populist left with his 2016 bid for president.When I asked him whether a moment during his upbringing revealed an ability to stand outside the established order, he recalled seeing boys torment smaller boys on the streets of Brooklyn.“From an early age, I did not like bullies who were picking on kids who were unable to defend themselves,” he said. But dealing with political bullies can be a complicated matter. Sanders said that, when forced to weigh political or financial capital with his own ideals, the decision invariably involves compromise.“I can pick apart every vote that I cast which was a yes vote and tell you that there were things in it that I really, really disliked, without exception,” he said, citing his vote for the Affordable Care Act. “So the judgment there is, ‘Is this what I want? Is this my view of what the American healthcare system should be?’ The answer is no. Will this keep people alive who otherwise might die or become much sicker than they should? The answer is yes. In politics it is never black or white or as clean as you would like it to be.”When I was a kid in rural Kansas during the Reagan era, the prevailing comment about politicians was, “they’re all crooks.” This assessment sprang from geographic and socioeconomic removal from the formally educated, soft-handed places that decided their fates as farmers, carpenters, cashiers and shelf-stockers.But incrimination of corrupt leadership should not go so far as to ignore those who try to keep a pure flame burning amid the toxic winds of politics and government. “To be very honest with you, it is not easy,” Sanders told me. “It’s not easy at all. I would be lying to you if I did not tell you that Washington is a very, very different environment in which to survive with decency. It is a phony environment. It’s an environment where people are very nice to you and then will do everything they can to undermine you. It is an environment where there is an enormous amount of ego. So it is a tough place in which to work, and it takes a toll on me.” Sanders encouraged budding representatives to “find colleagues who share a common sense of justice and those with you in the fight” and make frequent visits with earnest activists. He had just left a visit with Vermont youth involved in an ACLU immigration effort.“It strengthens me,” he said. “It makes me feel much more human, talking to these idealistic young kids who are trying to do the right thing.”While Sanders has surely seen it all behind closed doors in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged what she doesn’t know as a first-time candidate.“I can’t go in with a plan” for staying true, she said. “It’s one thing to say it’s so corrupt and compromised. But you don’t see the small ways in which that is so.”She might re-read her favorite moral texts, she said, or try to visit her would-be constituents back in the boroughs more often than other representatives do. Running without corporate money set the right foundation for the path ahead, she said. Still, “you just don’t know until you get there. But you walk in with an intention and a commitment.”She listed US representatives whose integrity inspires her: Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Ro Khanna of California, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Raúl Grijalva of Arizona. She said she hoped to have the courage of California representative Barbara Lee, who amid 435 representatives cast the lone House vote against the Iraq War in 2001.“I think they’re holding the candles,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I hope to just be one more.”Principled defiance among political leaders does more than affect policy. It inspires people on the ground.Grassroots activist Davis Hammet, best known for co-founding a rainbow-painted LGBTQ activist center right next to the infamous Westboro Baptist hate group in Topeka, Kansas, grew up in a conservative district in northern Florida.In early adulthood, he became increasingly alarmed by the Republican Party’s rightward shift on social issues. But when two conservative bills – to force women seeking abortions to have ultrasounds and to attach teacher pay to student performance – crossed Republican governor Charlie Crist’s desk, Crist would not abide. He vetoed both bills and left the Republican party.“I saw that political courage and I was like, ‘Oh, it’s OK to leave,’” Hammet told me by phone from Topeka. “This is not my values any more.” So much progress hinges, it seems, on what we are brave enough to say.Since moving to Kansas to start Equality House, Hammet has conducted anti-bullying campaigns in Kansas high schools and founded the organization Loud Light, aimed at registering young people to vote.Hammet, who is 28 – the same age as Ocasio-Cortez – originally planned to call his millennial-enfranchising group the Kansas Center for Democratic Participation. But a friend pointed out the distance between the detached language and Hammet’s personal vibe. He dug deeper and came up with the name Loud Light, which he said encourages people to vocalize views built on peace and goodness.“‘Moral’ has almost this uncomfortable connotation for a lot of people,” said Hammet, a non-religious guy who describes his worldview as “quantum oneness.” “But you say ‘loud light,’ and I think people get it. They’re like, ‘Yeah, being outspoken about the good stuff.’”It makes sense, then, that – in a culture whose framework for morality has relied on religion for centuries – many liberals would struggle to find the words to talk about what moves them at the deepest level.Virtue is a murky, subjective realm. Perceived righteousness in the wrong hands has led to countless wars and tragedies. For me, a good guide is this: Any set of “values” that draws lines between or hierarchies among people is bogus.The burgeoning movement for social justice among the religious left, the spiritual nonreligious, agnostics and atheists seems, to me, legit for the way it brings people together rather than ides them.New Jersey senator Cory Booker recently reflected on the concept of unity for an episode of On Being, the seminal public radio show that examines life’s deepest questions. He said one of his favorite books, the 1960s sociocultural analysis The Fire This Time, by James Baldwin, outlines horrifying truths but ends with two hopeful pages about coming together.“Here is Baldwin, who just talked about these fissures in our society, that ends this book by calling to blacks and whites to be ‘like lovers,’ he writes, and to insist upon and create a new consciousness that he goes: Human history is, and negro-American history is, in particular, a perpetual testimony to the achievement of the impossible,’” Booker told On Being host Krista Tippett. “And this is what I operate on, every single day. I am the physical manifestation of these inidual choices that were made, by so many people, to choose light over darkness.”Booker, who told Tippett he had been advised to sound “tougher,” said he now unapologetically lets his love flag fly whether it’s good political strategy or not. Last May, he and Massachusetts senator Warren – both thought to be contenders for the Democratic presidential ticket in 2020 – were the rare politicians to deliver activist sermons from a pulpit at a large conference of pastors and seminary students in Washington DC.The most frequent discussion he had touring for his 2016 book United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good was with people seeking “a sense of connection to other Americans that transcends the things that seem to be iding us, a sense of yearning in this country for an understanding that we’re all in this together.” Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez carried a message of unity when they took their democratic socialist message to Republican stronghold Kansas in support of local progressive campaigns. Their rallies in Wichita and Kansas City drew thousands, and they reiterated the sameness of Kansas people and their communities back east.“I understand that there are differences between the people in Vermont and the people in Kansas,” Sanders told me. “But the truth is that in virtually every area of human concern, the commonality, the common interests, of the people in the two states far, far outweighs whatever regional differences there may be.” Hammet pointed out that even rural areas – on maps, the conservative red area of the much-touted “rural-urban ide” – contain seeds of understanding that might lead more people there to join a progressive movement about togetherness. “Small towns recognize that they need each other,” Hammet said, citing the community ritual of a barn raising. “One family cannot raise a barn. Everyone comes together and helps each other, and there’s a social capital there. It’s not even inherently expressed. Everyone knows, ‘you’re helping me and I’m gonna help you, because we can’t do this without each other.’” Many white rural voters have been written off by the left as a lost cause. But Hammet learned not to simplistically cast others as villains when, through his work with Equality House, he lived next to the homophobic Westboro Baptist group.“You have these people that are monsters of the world, and they’re my neighbors who I see laughing with their kids at the park,” said Hammet, who identifies as queer. “You’re forced to be like, ‘All right, how can I accept that these are normal people that have an extreme view?’ Dangerous and problematic but also human.”Hammet said that facing social woes means looking in the mirror.“Everyone wants to condemn Westboro Baptist church, but they don’t want to admit and confront their own prejudice,” he said. “It’s really too easy to be like, ‘look, they’re homophobic, look, they’re racist,’ but it’s a lot harder to be like, wait I have a little bit of racism in me. I have a little bit of homophobia in me.” For him, facing social woes means looking in the mirror.Anyone who labors today for social progress has no assurance it will come to pass tomorrow – and if it does it may not be in their lifetimes. This is a conviction that requires motivation beyond logic. This is a civic faith.During Ocasio-Cortez’s recent speech in Kansas in support of candidate James Thompson’s effort to flip that congressional district blue for the first time in 26 years, she encouraged the crowd of underdogs – progressives in a “deep red” place – to commit to changing political outcomes by tirelessly knocking on doors even as pundits and naysayers say they’re wasting their time.That’s how she beat the odds in her primary race, a street hustle that wore holes in her shoes as she spoke to voters face to face.“That conversation can never be un-had,” she told the crowd. “Those doors can never be un-knocked. And the power will never go away.” This reminded me of a line from the bestselling spiritual tome A Course in Miracles, which defines “miracle” not as a favor granted by a bearded deity but as the correction of a misperception – specifically, the shift from fear to love: “A miracle is never lost. It may touch many people you have not even met, and produce undreamed of changes in situations of which you are not even aware.”One change that has been dreamed of, among this progressive set, is a “blue wave” of liberals winning races across the country in the fall midterm elections. Whether that comes to pass, Hammet said the civic engagement that so many previously apathetic Americans are awakening to – participating in “deciding what tomorrow looks like” – is an energizing force with many benefits. “I’ve had so many of my friends commit suicide. One thing I always felt is, they feel powerless to change anything. So I view civics as a health crisis,” he said. “We have to make people feel that power and live that power. The revolution is there. If people vote, it is a completely different world.” No one knows that better than Sanders, who in 1981 won the race for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, by 10 votes. He likened that victory to Ocasio-Cortez’s unlikely win. “She was a 100-to-one underdog,” Sanders said. “Turns out that the opposition was not quite as strong as people thought it would be. We’re seeing that all over the country. Sometimes when you do the right thing – and you organize at the grassroots level and you have ideas which resonate with people – you can do remarkable things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/311d89144d9fae316db4299f073241a436d875e0/562_83_2930_1758/master/2930.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13007df6654b845a1460e86888625197","title":"cracks appear in invincible xi jinpings authority over china","story":"Intellectuals voice criticism as analysts point to disharmony in the Communist partyRumours have swirled in Beijing in recent weeks that China’s seemingly invincible leader, Xi Jinping, is in trouble, dogged by a protracted trade war with the US, a slowing economy and a public health scandal involving thousands of defective vaccines given to children.Xi’s name seemed to have disappeared for a while from the cover of the People’s Daily, replaced with articles about his deputy, Li Keqiang, and large portraits of him were said to have been taken down after a young woman filmed herself throwing ink at his image.On 13 July, online reports claimed there was gunfire in central Beijing as a coup unfolded. A cryptic slogan emerged online: “No. 1 will rest while Ocean takes over the military,” a reference to a rival politician taking power.For now, Xi remains in full control of the government and party, and mentions of him in state-run media are as frequent as ever, but the hearsay is a sign all is not right with China’s most powerful leader in decades.“Such rumours may well lack credibility, but they do offer some indication that the disharmony within China’s party elite is increasing ,” the Hong Kong political analyst Lee Yee wrote in in the online journal China Heritage.This week, an essay by a law professor at Tsinghua University, one of the country’s top schools, made the rounds on Chinese social media. The essay - Our dread now and our hopes - by Xu Zhangrun offered one of the most direct criticisms of the Chinese government under Xi’s direction. Referring to Xi only as “that official”, Xu accused him of reversing years of reforms, effectively returning China to an era of totalitarian politics and a style of dictatorship last seen under Mao Zedong.“After 40 years of reform, overnight we’re back to the ancien régime,” he wrote, calling for the return of term limits, abolished under Xi earlier this year, the rehabilitation of those punished for the 4 June pro-democracy protests crushed by the government and an end to the cult of personality surrounding Xi.“The party is going to great lengths to create a new idol, and in the process it is offering up to the world an image of China as modern totalitarianism,” he wrote.Xu is one among several intellectuals voicing dissent. Zi Zhongyun, an international politics scholar, blamed the US-China trade war on the Xi administration’s failure to implement reforms in an article in June. Wenguang Sun, a retired professor at Shandong University published an essay in July urging Xi to stop spending money abroad on projects such as the Belt and Road initiative, and spend it at home instead.“For the first time since Xi Jinping gained power in 2012, he is facing a pushback from within the party, from liberal intellectuals and so forth,” said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation and adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.The pushback is also emerging in other ways. A group of alumni from Tsinghua published an open letter on Wednesday calling for the sacking of a professor over his claims China had emerged as the world’s top superpower. Hu Angang, who claimed in a series of speeches that China had surpassed the US in economic strength and technological know-how, is one of many who have echoed Xi’s claims that China has entered a new era of power on the world stage, reversing his predecessors’ more muted global aspirations. Such criticism is an indirect rebuke of Xi’s more assertive foreign policy, and comes as his opponents use economic troubles and failed trade negotiations with the US as pretext to question him, according to analysts.That dissent, while very unlikely to push Xi from power, could impede what had appeared to be his absolute hold over the party and the government. “His position is safe,” Lam said. “It’s just his authority has been dented to some extent. His authority has suffered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6936fa882a16303f346094864aa7bf94647c4d9a/220_220_2661_1596/master/2661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee20da6dabfb6cc42da249f56847428","title":"leave it out stonewall criticises paddy powers pride bus stunt","story":"The betting company will parade an empty open-top bus in Brighton to highlight the lack of out gay football playersA leading gay rights group has criticised a stunt intended to highlight the absence of any openly gay footballers in the Premier League.An empty open-top bus will feature at Brighton Pride on Saturday to point out the “statistical anomaly” that not one of the top 500 players in the Premier League is out.Stonewall said the stunt, which has been sponsored by betting operator Paddy Power, was “well-intentioned” but argued that no one should feel pressured to publicly declare their sexuality.Kirsty Clarke, Stonewall’s director of sport, said: “Coming out must always be a personal decision. Speculating over why people don’t come out ignores the many valid reasons someone may have for not being open about their sexuality. Focusing on the absence of openly LGBT players often adds more pressure to what is already a high-stress environment in elite sport.”The discord came as tens of thousands took to the streets of Brighton on Saturday for the city’s annual Pride parade before moving on to Preston Park for the festival.Performers include MNEK, Pixie Lott and Ella Eyre, with American pop superstar Britney Spears headlining on Saturday night.Rail passengers faced crowded stations and trains as they tried to reach Brighton, while Pride organisers said the event in Preston Park was sold out.The parade included a protest against the event’s main sponsor, British Airways, for allowing people being deported from the UK to be carried on its flights.On Friday, an open letter to the  signed by dozens of MPs and public figures called on the airline to “refuse to remain complicit” in working with the government to deport people. They claimed deportees included those facing persecution because of their sexuality.British Airways said it was legally bound to carry deportees when asked by the government. Meanwhile, Stonewall also called for the “endless stream of tabloid stories speculating about footballers’ sexual orientation” to stop.In May, the Sun published a story claiming a Premier League footballer had been having a “secret” gay relationship for four years but would not come out because he feared the backlash from fans would wreck his career.Paddy Power called on the Premier League to “boot itself into 2018, and create a welcoming environment for its first gay player”.“We think a Premier League footballer coming out as gay would have an extraordinary effect not just on the LGBT+ community, but society in general,” a spokesperson said.In recent years, Stonewall has been running its Rainbow Laces campaign, which aims to build support for LGBT equality not only in football but across many sports and has been backed by top-flight clubs including Arsenal.The group added: “The more support there is, the easier it will become for athletes to be open about their sexuality, if they choose to. We are slowly seeing a shift happen – for example, there are openly lesbian professional female footballers who are inspiring role models for inclusion in sport.“Footballers coming out can’t be taken as a sign of success or progress in isolation. This is only one part of a wider cultural shift … it’s everyone’s responsibility to make sport more inclusive – including companies and the media.”The FA chairman, Greg Clarke, has said footballers would face “significant abuse” if they came out while still playing. In May last year, he admitted football has a serious issue engaging with people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52c8b1458335970ffb4ada6abecb4297dad7010/0_82_3692_2215/master/3692.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d9beccd0a0c06f208f029f088a2aa9c","title":"north koreas nuclear programme has not been halted says un","story":"Experts’ report says Pyongyang is violating UN sanctions and continuing military cooperation with SyriaNorth Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes and is violating United Nations sanctions, UN experts have said in a report. A summary of the report, which was sent to the security council on Friday night and obtained by the Associated Press, said North Korea was also violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial measures.The panel of experts said Pyongyang had attempted to sell small arms, light weapons and other military equipment via foreign intermediaries, including Syrian arms traffickers in the case of Houthi Shia rebels in Yemen as well as Libya and Sudan. They also said the country had continued military cooperation with Syria, in breach of the UN sanctions. The panel said it was continuing to investigate sanctioned iniduals, companies and other entities in Asia that clandestinely procured centrifuges for North Korea’s nuclear programme and attempted to sell a wide range of military equipment to governments and armed groups in the Middle East and Africa. The security council first imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and has made them tougher in response to further nuclear tests and its increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile programme. Many diplomats and analysts credit the sanctions, which have sharply cut North Korea’s exports and imports, with helping to promote the thaw in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, and the June meeting between the US president, Donald Trump, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The report said North Korea “has not stopped its nuclear and missiles programmes” and continues to defy the sanctions resolutions. The experts said ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, oil and coal involve “increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques”.These include turning off automatic identification systems, which are required to be on at all times under international regulations, physically disguising North Korean tankers, using small unregistered vessels, illegally changing names, carrying out night transfers and using additional vessels to trans-ship cargo, the report said. The US said last month that North Korea was illegally smuggling refined petroleum products into the country beyond the quota of 500,000 barrels a year allowed under the UN sanctions. US documents sent to the security council committee monitoring the sanctions cite 89 instances between 1 January and 30 May, in which North Korean tankers were likely to have delivered refined products “illicitly procured” via ship-to-ship transfers. The experts said if the report was accurate, North Korea would be violating sanctions and all countries “would have to immediately halt all such transfers”.

Children of French pâtissiers and boulangers also know this feeling of gourmand envy and admiration. At my school in Paris in the 1980s, those kids were always the most popular, far more sought after than the children of aristocrats with châteaux in the country.Perhaps it is thanks to this auspicious beginning in life, then, that Macron, 65, seems to have retained a sunny disposition. We have yet to see a picture of her looking brooding or angry, no small feat for someone constantly scrutinised by the celebrity press in search of new wrinkles, signs of fatigue and faux-pas.It makes a nice change from recent French first ladies such as Cécilia Sarkozy or Valérie Trierweiler, the former partner of François Hollande: both women always looked uncomfortable. Uncomfortable in their role or in their relationships – who knows? Both, probably. Macron, however, appears to have problems with neither. A year after her husband’s election, even as he has seen his own popularity plunge, she is flourishing.She may have been helped in this by some simple steps taken by Élysée to bring, for the first time since 1958 and the start of the Fifth Republic, some long overdue transparency to the role and activities of the French first lady. A previously undefined position has become a little clearer. Every month Macron’s meetings and initiatives are published by the Élysée, and, even if she is not expected to perform anywhere near as many duties as, for example, the spouse of the US president, she still is fairly busy.In June, for instance, among other things, she went to the theatre, which she loves, and visited the Pompidou centre’s new exhibitions she attended funerals, had meetings with MPs, a lunch with the French football team, accompanied her husband to the G7 summit in Montréal, spent time with the Trudeaus, went to see the pope, and gave a dinner for a cardinal. She visited schools developing anti-bullying campaigns, and learning centres welcoming autistic children: two causes understood to be close to her heart. But her popularity goes beyond the day-to-day job. The fact that she faced the scandal of leaving her husband for a former pupil who was the same age as her children, in provincial France, is seen by many as showing her resolve. In fact, being 25\u0026nbspyears older than her husband perhaps increases her appeal with the French. The country has always boasted alluring mature female figures. Remember the 1940s star Arletty think chanteuse Juliette Gréco, actresses Jeanne Moreau, Isabelle Huppert and Juliette Binoche: all women whose talent, wit, intelligence and character played as big a part as their beauty.The French also like style. When I say style, I mean a way of doing things that is both idiosyncratic and universal. In Macron’s case, her fashion doesn’t do her any favours: her look is slightly dated, a little like her blond bob. She was a teenager in the 1960s and a working woman in the 1980s, and this shows. As the French political commentator Anne-Élisabeth Moutet puts it: “Her choice of Vuitton as her official dresser was probably not the best. Nicolas Ghesquière, Vuitton’s artistic director, may be in his 40s but he is stuck in the past. She has a small frame and those jackets with shoulder pads are not becoming.” Yet the French don’t seem to mind much. She is seen to have a style that transcends sartorial mishaps.I refer here to her habit of walking and thinking, of organising daily walkabout meetings with her staff. We call it flâner, or as Lauren Elkin, Paris-based American author of the bestseller Flâneuse put it, of “flâneuse-ing”. Walking through Paris every morning not only allows Macron to think more clearly but also to meet people going about their day and eager to share their thoughts. As Elkin wrote: “The flâneurs, attuned to the chords that vibrate throughout their city, know without knowing.” François Mitterrand used to wander along Paris’s riverbanks in the same way, taking with him a minister or an adviser. Mitterrand, elected twice, left a deep mark on French politics.Emmanuel Macron, who has recently been seriously tainted by the Benalla scandal (one of his bodyguards, now sacked, impersonated a policeman at a May Day demonstration and assaulted two protesters), might like to try it. His reputation for being too Jupiterian would be helped. He might be seen as less out of touch. It may still not be enough, however, for him to dare to hope that he will one day be as popular as his wife.Few people remember her – not because she was not memorable, but because the president’s wife held no official role at the start of the Fifth Republic. Even figures like Mesdames Mitterrand and Giscard d’Estaing were confined to polite semi-obscurity with, perhaps, the exception of Madame Pompidou, known for her love of the arts and couture. A wife in the traditional mould, Chirac was probably the first French first lady, and a tough cookie at that. She was notably admired for putting up with Jacques’ affairs, although she said in 2001 she had warned him repeatedly that “Napoleon started to lose everything the day that he abandoned Josephine”.She didn’t vote for her husband in the second ballot and was last seen at an official event at the Bastille Day celebrations just two months after Nicolas Sarkozy became president. Was controversially dispatched by the Élysée to Libya to try to secure the release of a group of foreign medics from jail. Sarkozy’s office announced they had separated in October of the same year. The polyglot Piedmontese heiress and model-turned-chanteuse, right, proved a gracious and impeccably attired representative of French culture. The couple remain married and had a daughter in 2011. The Paris Match journalist was briefly France’s first girlfriend before François Hollande was found to be having an affair with the actress Julie Gayet. Trierweiler was quickly overshadowed by her rival, who did not perform any official role while Hollande was in the Élysée.

Photograph: Sandra MailerInphoThe Labour Party has called on the Government to refund the Irish women’s hockey squad the €550 each paid to represent Ireland. Labour Party Cork local area representative Peter Horgan described the representation fee as a “shameful practice”. “The Ireland squad is the first Irish team to reach a world cup final in any sport. They have done so in a sport where most of the teams they face are professional,” said Mr Horgan. “These women have brought pride, grit and determination to the finals in London and they should never have been in the situation where they had to pay to represent their country.“The Ministers for Sport – Shane Ross and Brendan Griffin – must instruct Sport Ireland to make a once-off payment to this team and put in place provisions that no team . . . will have to pay to represent this nation in their respective code’s finals.” The Irish men’s and women’s hockey teams receive funding from Sport Ireland, the Women in Sport programme and from Sport Northern Ireland to prepare for the World Cup. Nevertheless, the shortfall means that each squad member has to pay €550 to represent their country. Neither Mr Ross nor Mr Griffin mentioned the €550 payment in their congratulatory message to the team. Mr Ross said he considered himself “very fortunate” to have witnessed their success. “ No other team has played on such a stage and they have truly lit up the country as we joined them on this epic journey,” he said. “ The courage and nerve shown by the whole squad and management but particularly by Gillian Pender and Ayeisha McFerran in the penalty shootout was a joy to behold. “I am sure up and down the country young girls and boys will be trying to replicate those outstanding moments for years to come. And we wait with bated breath in the hope they bring home the cup either way they have done us all so proud.”DUP leader Arlene Foster was among the politicians who congratulated the Irish women on their success. She tweeted: “Absolutely brilliant result for the Ireland ladies hockey team on reaching the World Cup final. @IreWomenHockey inspiring a generation of young players! #HWC2018”. Lord Mayor of Dublin Cllr Nial Ring said he intends to organise a civic reception for the team when they come back to Dublin on Monday.

The special 9 per cent VAT rate is anticipated to come to a partial end when Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe announces his tax and spending package in October.Under proposals currently being strongly considered by the Government, the full 13.5 per cent rate will only be restored for businesses that sell “accommodation”, such as hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfasts. The resurgence in the tourism sector, including high prices in many hotels, is expected to be used as a rationale for the change. In such a scenario, other businesses – such as restaurants, cafes, hairdressers and various entertainment services – would see their VAT rate remain at 9 per cent. Newspapers would also remain at 9 per cent, it is understood. The lower rate was introduced during the economic crisis to encourage tourism and to boost the hospitality sector. The cost of the rate since its introduction in 2011 has been €2.7 billion.The programme for government, agreed between Fine Gael and the Independents, committed to retaining the rate as long as “prices remain competitive”. The tax strategy papers published by the Department of Finance this week said that while “tourism has grown significantly . . . prices have not remained competitive”.The papers outlined how much an increase back to 13.5 per cent for each of the sectors currently on 9 per cent would yield the exchequer. A full 4.5 per cent increase in VAT for “tourist accommodation” would bring in €208 million, Mr Donohoe’s officials estimate. Extending the increase to restaurants would yield another €183 million, but this is seen as a harder political sell given that the main effect of the 9 per cent rate on domestic taxpayers is felt in cafes and restaurants. Restoring it across the board, including to entertainment and newspapers, would bring in €527 million.The mooted move would mean, for example, that a hotel would levy the 13.5 per cent on its bed stays but only 9 per cent on goods sold in its bars and restaurants.Potential mitigating measures for those in rural areas, who may not have seen as much increase in activity as others, are a possibility, it is believed. Similar to last year’s budget, some revenue will have to be raised to bring the overall budget day package to just over €1 billion. The VAT rate, as well as a potential increase in carbon tax, has been earmarked for increases that will help pay for income tax cuts. An increase in betting tax is also being considered.The Department of Finance also conducted a separate study on the special VAT rate, which was also published this week. “Positive developments within the 9 per cent sectors suggest that demand and employment are unlikely to be substantially directly affected by an increase,” it says. The report adds that, as the economy reaches full employment, “continued stimulus” would “likely add to overheating pressures”. This could include “excess investment in an already-buoyant sector, and a ersion of labour from more productive uses”.

Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Facebook found to be promoting \u0026#39dangerous\u0026#39 homemade cancer cures Edinburgh church votes to split from the Scottish Episcopal Church in early sign of schism at decision to support gay marriageSearch underway for missing Victoria Cross ahead of commemorative exhibitionMichael Palin kept letter from chiropodist angry after he joked they only deal with verrucasStudents injured in Bangladesh as teen protests turn violentPlastic topiary balls \u0026#39should be sent into extinction\u0026#39 Alan Titchmarsh saysIndia Club saved from demolition as planners say it is a “special place in the history of our Indian community” and must be protectedFuture uncertain for Zimbabwe after contentious election and deadly clashes Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail - but will his slogans and boasts win at the mid-terms?French wine scientists create \u0026#39supergrapes\u0026#39 that do not require pesticidesAfrican Horse Sickness could wipe out nine in 10 of Britain’s horses if it reaches UKComment:  It’s time to be brave and choose the open sea once againJapan\u0026#39s middle-aged men hire themselves out to regain their social statusThe crown jewels of Freudianism: Searching for the secret rings Freud gave his closest followers Signal failure delays could become complaint of the past as train company tests new cloud technology Thai cave boys return home after completing training at Buddhist templeDonald Campbell\u0026#39s Bluebird takes to the water again, watched by his daughterBody found as police search disused quarry for missing midwifeComment: Baggage reclaim is the ultimate gladiatorial arena.

These are worrying times for all British horses.”In guidance issued for owners and breeders, The British Horse Society warned owners to be on the look out for the virus. “With climate change and an increase in the international movement of horses there is a possibility that AHS could reach Britain, although the risk is not presently considered to be high,” said the BHS.“However, were AHS to arrive on these shores it is imperative that it is spotted quickly in order that it can be dealt with rapidly and prevented from spreading.“It is possible that an AHS outbreak could occur in the UK if the virus were to be imported and, given the severe welfare and economic consequences of AHS, this would have devastating consequences to the naïve UK equine population.”There is currently no good vaccine against the disease. The main vaccine, which is not licensed in Europe, has in some cases actually caused outbreaks of the disease in AfricaThe Equine Disease Coalition, which was established in 2011 to prevent outbreaks in Britain, is currently working towards an improved vaccine.Please review our commenting policyFacebook found to be promoting \u0026#39dangerous\u0026#39 homemade cancer cures Edinburgh church votes to split from the Scottish Episcopal Church in early sign of schism at decision to support gay marriageSearch underway for missing Victoria Cross ahead of commemorative exhibitionMichael Palin kept letter from chiropodist angry after he joked they only deal with verrucasStudents injured in Bangladesh as teen protests turn violentPlastic topiary balls \u0026#39should be sent into extinction\u0026#39 Alan Titchmarsh saysIndia Club saved from demolition as planners say it is a “special place in the history of our Indian community” and must be protectedFuture uncertain for Zimbabwe after contentious election and deadly clashes Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail - but will his slogans and boasts win at the mid-terms?French wine scientists create \u0026#39supergrapes\u0026#39 that do not require pesticidesComment:  It’s time to be brave and choose the open sea once againJapan\u0026#39s middle-aged men hire themselves out to regain their social statusThe crown jewels of Freudianism: Searching for the secret rings Freud gave his closest followers Signal failure delays could become complaint of the past as train company tests new cloud technology Thai cave boys return home after completing training at Buddhist templeDonald Campbell\u0026#39s Bluebird takes to the water again, watched by his daughterBody found as police search disused quarry for missing midwifeComment: Baggage reclaim is the ultimate gladiatorial arena.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/13/10/Cyborg_Neil_Harbisson.jpg","title":"human evolution religion neanderthal modern civilisation","story":"Created with Sketch.Adorn ourselves with technologies as we may, our brains can\u0027t get out of\u0026nbspcaveman combat mode.

Northern Ireland-born contemporary artist \u0027Cyborg\u0027 Neil Harbisson presents his lecture \u0027hear colors\u0027 I was recently listening to a six-year old girl – using Skype on a tablet – explaining how flying cars work to her grandmother, while at the same time reading about an 11-year old girl who had just become the third wife of a 41-year old rubber merchant,\u0026nbspwhen I was finally forced to the conclusion that the present no longer exists.There is nothing but the distant future and the remote past existing simultaneously – locked into some kind of embrace in our brains. Inevitably, since the outer world replicates the inner, there is also a conflict being acted out between them all around the world. And at the moment, so far as I can see, the caveman is winning out over homo deus.I am currently in New York. When I got here the clocks, on EST, were five\u0026nbsphours behind London time. But my biological clock was set to GMT. Hence jet lag, the queasy sensation of shifting from one time zone to another, getting ahead of or falling behind the chronology of the sun. I got over it in a day. I adapted.But there is a larger sense in which we have never fully adapted to a much longer shift in time. The hunter-gatherer co-exists within the city-dweller. I can go about Manhattan, technologically enhanced, relying on satnav and a weather app to guide me, while at the same time, in one part of my brain, convinced that I am hunting a woolly mammoth, and potentially prey to saber tooths.I am both urban vegetarian and bloodthirsty not-so-noble savage. This is the 100,000-year jetlag, which we still haven’t got over. We are the messed-up, conflicted product of asynchronous development (which I date, very approximately, from the hypothetical origin of language).We are out of sync with ourselves. We really do suffer from déjà vu, the sense of having been here before, but long long ago, the primal memory of palaeolithic\u0026nbspbehaviour engraved deep in our neural pathways. It’s probably the fundamental insight of evolutionary and anthropological thinking of the past couple of centuries, from Cuvier and Lamarck on.Flintstone\u0026nbspand Space Oddity, aiming at the stars and still roaming about the Kalahari\u0027 (Getty)Like archaeopteryx, every bird is part dinosaur. In the same way, we are a curious mix of Fred Flintstone and Space Oddity, aiming at the stars and still roaming about the Kalahari. Current conflicts bear this out. In the UK, it’s all about leaving versus remaining. In the US, it’s red states versus blue states. But these arguments could not even exist if that cognitive dissonance was not already in place in the vast collective unconscious.We (in our split psyche) want it all. Red and blue, leave and remain – which is why Theresa May’s dog’s dinner approach might actually stand a chance, since it reflects a fundamental reality. Half-in, half-out is exactly where we are in terms of our development as a species. An intermediate, morally ambiguous state.The great 19th-century French sociologist, Auguste Comte, taking the long view, formed the opinion that humanity had traversed two earlier phases, the theological and the metaphysical, and we had finally broken through into the more scientifically informed sunlit uplands of “positivism”. Maybe he really believed this, but it’s roughly on a par with saying “good dog” to a particularly troublesome beast. It’s borderline wishful thinking. We have somehow managed to telescope Comte’s three\u0026nbspstages into one highly confused state. The inescapable truth of our day is that the mythic never went away. Our thinking is mytho-positivist.\u0026nbspThe global village makes us conscious of how connected we are. Not only with one another but with other species too. Unless you’re Robinson Crusoe, interdependence is the central fact of our everyday lives. No man is an island. We are, as the quantum physicists say, entangled. And yet we are seemingly ruled by manic isolationism and naked tribalism. I offer just a few examples of our 21st-century schizoid mind.We began with sacrificing animals to the gods. Then we moved on to humans. We created a whole religion out of a single act of crucifixion. A religion in which even God seems to think that by sacrificing someone (his son?) he can placate the gods. It may be the most magical feature of fascism. If we get rid of them, all of our problems are over. In Occupied Paris even the Nazis were surprised at how willing the French (some of them) were to go along with this idea.“Why didn’t you provide more evidence for your existence?” Bertrand Russell said he would say to God. He assumed it would eventually go out of fashion. But if anything it’s been making a comeback. Religion is recycling itself. Nothing is more depressing than to see a dogma passed on from one generation to the next, like a baton in a relay race. We can only hope that someone will drop it. I get the need for some kind of emotional reassurance in a world in which everybody dies. But doesn’t it still make more sense to seek it from fellow mortals rather than from an immortal (who is surely bound to be indifferent)?Digital photogrammetry being used to record 3D images of the micro-topography on the tops of the lintels at Stonehenge.

It’s one of the worst things you can personally do for the planet. Unless you happen to be a member of the meat marketing board, no one seriously thinks that meat is good for you. Hunting once had a logic – survival – and it is possible that hunting might have provided the core of our earliest narratives around the campfire. But the industrialisation of meat is just an absurdity.AFPGetty Images)Probably one day this phase in our development will come to be seen as on a par with cannibalism. Meanwhile, we remain nostalgic for the kill. Even if someone else is doing it for us.Everybody now knows (in the empirical part of the brain) that sugar is bad for you. Sugar is the biggest single cause of type 2 diabetes. Even the Tate and Lyle website seems to suggest you might want to tone it down just a little bit. Meanwhile, we continue to crave it and consume it in vast quantities. It made sense when, back in the day, there was so little of it around. Now there is too much but we haven’t adjusted our mindset. Yet.\u0026nbspSimilar to sugar. The positive thing to be said for sex is that it marked a huge advance on self-reproducing amoebas. It may be more fun, although it’s hard to know with amoebas. Sexual bifurcation has served its purpose. But everything a vet was saying to me the other day to deter me from breeding a dog also applies to humans: it’s painful, it’s liable to cause trauma, it spreads disease, and there are enough stray dogs around already. In-vitro casual encounters appear to be the way forward. Thus transcending the frenzied, exhausting performances of masculinity and femininity.\u0026nbspMade sense when our existence really was liable to be cut short by wolves, bears, and man-hunting species. Now, in the age of the anthropocene, it’s all the other way around. Made in the image of a rather vicious God. A zealous evangelical once put a helpful leaflet in my hand, with a graphic depicting humans on one side of an abyss (man and wife with two kids and a car) – and cows and goats and dogs and cats on the other side.Cersei Lannister is ruthless in her quest for power\u0026nbsp(AP)But the ingenious thing about the cartoon was that it somehow suggested that all the non-humans secretly want to become human. Humanity is what poor old animals can only aspire to.Other than dragons, the whole raison d’être of Game of Thrones is to emphasise – quite rightly – how primal we remain in our thinking. Practically everyone wants to be king or queen. Kill everyone who gets in your way. The Old World primate is never far away.Modernity is part of the myth. We remain pre-modern. As Claude Lévi-Strauss points out in The Savage Mind, 99 per cent\u0026nbspof our culture was formed before the invention of writing. The rise of thrillers and “crime” is a manifestation of the jetlag. We still think in terms of a saviour figure, whether detective or not, who has come to redeem the darkness. The cynegetic paradigm (so named by Carlo Ginzburg) embraces both hunter-gatherers following a scent or a trail and a clue-hunting Sherlock Holmes (and a Sigmund Freud psychoanalysing our conflicts). The retro appeal is the key to the success of, for example, Stephen King. Something wicked this way comes. Serial killers are real, but we also re-invent them to have the pleasure of killing them off.Strangely related to “crime”, possibly without the quote marks. The time is more out of joint in our politics than ever. As above we are still looking for a charismatic saviour figure, a Shane-style gunslinger to ride into town and clear out the bad guys, to purify, or “drain the swamp”. The politics of paranoia require us to be afraid of all the other mad tribes out there. Post-truth began around 100,000 years ago, at exactly the same time as truth, when people realised they could lie about practically anything and yet still be believed.\u0026nbspHow literature has been committing mass femicide for centuriesHere’s why Google Translate will never outsmart the human mindA second Cold War is upon us: and we only have ourselves to blamePerhaps the only really interesting question of our times is whether we can ever transcend our atavistic impulses and finally get over the 100,000-year jetlag. Without wishing to strike an absurdly over-optimistic note, I think we can. Are we pre-determined in our behaviour by a 100,000 year legacy (or, in reality, much longer)? Are we locked into our past?I think the answer to this question is that only when we realise exactly how determined we are by our pre-history will we then cease to be completely outflanked by our own DNA. A friend recently put a Neanderthal flint axehead in my hand, roughly 250,000 years old. As I held it I could definitely feel a kind of ancient resonance rippling through my cells. The old ways. I could easily see myself smashing in the skull of some poor passing creature with it. Or an enemy. Perhaps if we at least start to acknowledge how mythic and murderous we really are, then there is at least a possibility of becoming more altruistic.\u0026nbspAndy Martin is the author of \u0027Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me\u0027 and teaches at the University of CambridgeEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil?

Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt.

Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

Both backed the idea of a “double referendum”.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading spokesperson for the People’s Vote campaign, told The Independent: “The Brexiteers hold themselves up as champions of democracy and have at various stages been advocates of a referendum on the final Brexit deal – eagerly so in the belief they would win it – and now have backtracked as their promises have run off the rails during the negotiations.Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrats\u0027 Brexit spokesperson, said: Giving people the final say on the Brexit deal is essential and common sense - the Brexiters who one claimed they\u0027d trust people to have the final say must now come clean on why they\u0027ve changed their mind.A cynic may suggest it\u0027s because of the mess Brexit is becoming and the increasing clarify on the damage it will do the United Kingdom.“They need to explain why they think an elite in Westminster should determine what the UK should do at the end of this process, and not the people.”In a speech in parliament in 2011, Ms Rees-Mogg suggested a second referendum could be held and that it would “make more sense” if this was after Britain completed\u0026nbspnegotiations with the EU”.Responding to a question about how the Brexit referendum would work, he replied: “That issue can be dealt with in the legislation.

That has been the European Union’s approach too many times.”David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, also previously proposed a “double referendum”.In a speech in 2012, he said the government should first spell out what sort of relationship it wanted with the EU, and put this to a public vote in a “mandate referendum”.A second vote should then take place after negotiations with the EU, he said. In this “decision referendum”, “the British people would either approve the new negotiated relationship, or if it was not good enough, it would trigger the negotiation to leave the Union”.He said: “This approach has a number of advantages: the mandate referendum would stiffen the spines of our negotiators, and undermine the legitimacy of the European resistance to change. One of the characteristics of the EU is that it never backs down in the face of national demands except when they are backed up by a referendum.“This in turn would mean that British citizens would be offered the best possible circumstances for staying in, as well as a real alternative in pulling out. The purpose of this strategy is to maximise both the democratic legitimacy and the negotiating leverage to achieve our policy aims.”Mr Redwood backed Mr Davis’ proposal\u0026nbspin an article posted on his website in 2012.He said the public should be given a vote on whether they wanted the UK to “negotiate a new relationship with the EU based on trade and political cooperation”.May to meet Macron in last-ditch bid to win Brexit concessionsBrexit uncertainty holding back new business growth in UK services Brexit is set to betray working people, so I back a Final SayFollowing negotiations, they would then be asked whether they wanted to withdraw from the EU.In a post in 2012, he wrote: “The second referendum would follow once the negotiations were complete. That would ask: do you want to accept the new negotiated relationship with the EU or not? Voting No means withdrawing from the EU.“This seems to me to be the best way forward. The negotiations would also allow the government to negotiate the items that would need to be sorted out for exit anyway. There do need to be arrangements on ferry routes, airspace, pipelines, extradition, police intelligence and all the rest between the UK and the rest of the EU.”Mr Redwood also used a  article in the run-up to the 2016 poll to suggest a second referendum was a certainty if Britain voted to remain in the EU.Explaining why he no longer backed a second referendum, Mr\u0026nbspRedwood told The Independent: The double referendum strategy was proposed when the leadership of the Conservative Party refused to offer a simple LeaveRemain referendum in a manifesto to see if they could accept that instead. They didn’t.Subsequently they agreed to a one\u0026nbspreferendum approach, as did the people in the general election and the Parliament which followed. You can\u0027t change strategies – we did not have a mandate referendum, we held a single LeaveRemain referendum which now has to be implemented.Mr Rees-Mogg and Mr Davis\u0026nbsphave been contacted for comment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/20/gettyimages-847200760.jpg","title":"almond milk recall dairy almond breeze hp hood","story":"Created with Sketch.Only one allergic reaction has been reported so farClick to followThe Independent USBlue Diamond almond breeze beverage tetra packs on sale in CanadaVegans of the world might want to double-check their refrigerators: A major manufacturer just recalled more than 145,000 cartons of almond milk for containing actual dairy.HP Hood, the manufacturer of Almond Breeze almond milk, recalled 145,254 half-gallon cartons of the milk alternative this week.“Milk inadvertently was entered into the processing equipment for almond milk,” HP Hood spokeswoman Lynne Bohan told the Huffington Post.The milk-containing milk-alternative was shipped to 28 US states, from New York to Oklahoma.

The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes.

The almond milk market hit about $890m in US sales in 2015, according to Bloomberg. That’s far less than the $17.8bn traditional milk market, but enough to make dairy farmers nervous.Nearly 25 salad and wrap products may contain harmful parasite Durex recalls condoms sold in UK and Ireland over fears they may burstThe FDA recently signalled it may prohibit dairy alternatives from being labelled as “milk” to prevent confusion. The change is a question of “standards of identity,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said at an event last month, adding that the agency’s current standards for milk reference products from lactating animals.“An almond doesn’t lactate, I will confess,” Mr Gottlieb said at a Politico summit.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/04/09/mccafe.jpg","title":"mcdonald s coffee pregnant woman cleaning fluid canada alberta","story":"Created with Sketch.Sarah Douglas, who is eight months pregnant, says drink made her mouth burn for 45 minutes\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent USThe latte machine at the Canadian branch of McDonald\u0027s was hooked up to a cleaning solution used to remove milk residueSarah Douglas, 31, who is eight months pregnant with her third child, ordered a medium latte\u0026nbspat a McDonald’s in Alberta, Canada, on the way to her son’s baseball tournament.Driving on the motorway\u0026nbspshortly after, she flipped open the spout on the lid and took a sip and immediately, she knew something was wrong.“It just felt like my mouth was burning,” she said.Ms Douglas pulled over to a ditch on the side of the road and “immediately spat all of it out,” she said.

Unfortunately, the milk supply line was connected to the cleaning solution while this guest’s drink was made,” he said.“We have taken immediate action to review the proper cleaning procedures with the team and have put additional signage up as an added reminder.”Ms Douglas asked to photograph the cleaning agent, and an employee brought her the jug. He was wearing rubber gloves, she said, and for good reason.The chemicals cause “serious eye irritation” the label warned, and “may cause an allergic skin reaction.”Ms Douglas called poison control and learned that this particular cleanser was acid-based, she said, but she didn’t have any symptoms that would require a trip to the hospital.She had\u0026nbspa fuzzy, burning sensation in her mouth that\u0026nbspdidn’t disappear for at least 45 minutes.“It took a couple of days for the smell and the taste to even leave my mind,” Ms Douglas said.The special currency that can buy you a free Big MacMcDonald’s to ban plastic straws in all of its UK restaurantsHow fast-food chains have responded to the EU’s plastic clampdownLethbridge News Now, a local news organisation, was first to report the episode.Alberta Health Services, the health authority for the province, investigated the franchise this week and “became aware that a similar incident had occurred about a month previously,” said Gwen Wirth, a spokeswoman for the agency. She declined to provide further details.After Ms Douglas went public with her story, a man who lives in Alberta told CBC News that the same thing happened to him in December, but at a different McDonald’s location.“We are aware that there are other isolated incidents of this nature,” said Kristen Hunter, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s. “Even one incident is too many.“While the specialty coffee machines and usage procedures are of the highest industry standards, we have immediately reinforced proper cleaning procedures with all McDonald’s restaurants.”Despite the safety methods in place at McDonald’s and at other large corporations, there are several examples in recent years of customers receiving tainted drinks.In 2015, a Seattle-area woman sued Starbucks after she drank a hot chocolate tainted with a coffee machine cleaner that she said caused her to suffer medical problems.In the\u0026nbspsame year, a Utah woman sued the coffee company after she said her throat was burned with the same cleaner, and an Indianapolis police officer wound up in the hospital because he drank a McDonald’s iced tea that his family said was contaminated with cleaning chemicals.In 2016,\u0026nbspa woman in Texas said she found two cleaning tablets in her Starbucks venti mocha, something she didn’t discover until she had drank half of it and developed a stomachache.Starbucks serves millions of customers every day, as does McDonald’s. The number of known instances of tainted drinks being served is relatively small.But it is still a cause for concern, Ms Douglas said –\u0026nbspespecially for parents who might buy hot chocolate for their children or other foods that are dispensed from similar machines.“A child could have easily been a victim of this had it not happened to me,” she said.Food borne illness has also been a concern for McDonald’s, which was in the news recently for serving salads linked to cyclosporiasis illnesses that have made\u0026nbsp395 people\u0026nbspill\u0026nbspin 15 states.Ms Douglas said that by speaking about her experience she hoped to educate the public and also push the food industry to be more stringent in implementing safety protocols.“This was a preventable mistake,” she said. “Big as McDonald’s is, there’s no excuse.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/04/17/bees.jpg","title":"us bee pesticides ban overturned neonic population decline wildlife refuges","story":"Created with Sketch.Environmentalists warn reversal of policy could pose threat to \u0027most vital and vulnerable species\u0027Click to followThe Independent USNeonic pesticides have been linked to the decline in bee populationsDonald Trump\u0027s administration has reversed a ban on the use of pesticides that have been linked to declining bee populations and the production of\u0026nbspgenetically-modified crops in US wildlife refuges.The rollback, announced in a memo by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, will\u0026nbspend a two-year ban from the Obama-era brought in following a lawsuit by environmentalists.Limited agricultural activity is permitted on some refuges by law, including cooperative agreements in which farmers can grow certain crops to produce more food or improve a habitat for wildlife.Campaigners have said the lifting of restrictions poses a grave threat to pollinating insects and other creatures relying in toxin-free environments.“Industrial agriculture has no place on refuges dedicated to wildlife conservation and protection of some of the most vital and vulnerable species,” said Jenny Keating, federal lands policy analyst for the group Defenders of Wildlife.Previously, the US had prohibited the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, or neonics, on wildlife refuges, in conjunction with genetically modified organism (GMO)\u0026nbspcrops, engineered to resist insect pests.Neonics are a class of insecticides tied by research to declining populations of wild bees and other pollinating insects around the world.Rather than continuing to impose a blanket ban on GMO crops and neonics on refuges, Fish and Wildlife Service deputy director Greg Sheehan said in a memo\u0026nbspthat decisions about their use would be made on a case-by-case basis.Mr Sheehan said the move was needed to ensure adequate forage for migratory birds, including ducks and geese favoured and hunted by sportsmen on many of the nation\u0027s refuges.US interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose department oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, has made expansion of hunting on public lands a priority for his agency.Sheehan wrote that genetically modified organisms have helped “maximise production, and that neonicotinoids might be needed to fulfil needed farming practices.”World news in picturesPresident-elect, Emmerson Mnangagwa steps onto the lawn to pose for photographs and selfies after attending a press conference on August 3, 2018 in Harare, Zimbabwe.

But India’s system of insurance for those that succumb ensures owners have no incentive to properly care for them.Members of Save the Asian Elephants (Stae), together with actress Evanna Lynch, who starred as Luna Lovegood in the\u0026nbspHarry Potter franchise, are presenting a petition of 200,000 signatures and an open letter to Ms May, calling for:The Department for Environment, Food and\u0026nbspRural Affairs (Defra) to support a new law to ban the advertising or promotion in or from the UK of unethical Asian elephant-related holidays abroad\u0026nbspTheresa May to honour the government’s 2015 election manifesto pledge to “support the Indian government in its efforts to protect the Asian elephant”Ms May and environment secretary Michael Gove to begin talks with India’s leader Narendra Modi to end the beating of baby elephants to “break their spirits”\u0026nbspand to restore the proper treatment of captive elephantsThe government to pressure India to release captive elephants to protected forests or genuine sanctuaries and to help establish a model elephant sanctuary, as well as a training centre for mahouts (drivers) and veterinary exchanges between the two countries to raise standards of careThe pressure group also wants the Association of British Travel Agents to press its members to advertise only genuine elephant sanctuaries or wildlife reserves where elephants are observed from a distance, with no rides,\u0026nbsptrekking, chains, costumes, festivals or circus tricksAt the same time, the charity World Animal Protection has compiled a list of five of the best ethical elephant venues to visit, based on its worldwide research.The Stae activists also have the support of Peter Egan, who starred in Downton Abbey, Ever Decreasing Circles and Hold the Sunset.Ms Lynch said: “I want everyone to know of the cruelty and suffering endangered Asian elephants go through due to misinformed holidaymakers paying for elephant entertainments at many tourist attractions.\u0026nbspPeople wrongly assume the elephants are trained humanely. “So often they have no idea the Asian elephant species is threatened with extinction.”We must stop the ruthless treatment of these sentient creatures who feel pain, suffering, terror and loneliness in captivityCaptive elephants are often poached from the wild when they are calves to be “trained” for attractions such as giving rides, festivals, circuses, parades and working at temples.Witnesses said\u0026nbspeach animal is isolated in a wooden “crushing” cage, starved, sleep-deprived, hit with iron bars, planks and spikes, and beaten into submission. This “pajan” process is so violent it is believed more than half of the young elephants die during or after it.Their ankles often become painfully infected from where they have been chained.The torment can lead elephants to attack tourists, sometimes fatally. Duncan McNair, chief executive\u0026nbspof Stae, said he believed it was illegal not to warn tourists of the dangers they face.“I’ve yet to meet anyone in the west who thinks it’s a good idea to beat and torture baby elephants,” he told The Independent.\u0026nbspHe said although they were expecting some resistance from those with a vested commercial interest, the huge support for an advertising ban made it an obvious step to take.David Cameron promised in 2015 to help India improve elephant welfare and now that time is running out the Brexit talks should not stand in the way of government action, Mr McNair\u0026nbspsaid.“Some ministers say a great majority of 52 per cent voted for Brexit but in this, 89 per cent backed urgent action.\u0026nbspWe’ll be talking to Labour about this too. The Conservatives must not have their clothes stolen on it. I would be deeply shocked if we\u0026nbspdidn’t get a positive response from Michael\u0026nbspGove.”Asian elephants have\u0026nbspbeen on the IUCN Red List of endangered species since 1986 after the population plummeted from millions in the late 19th century\u0026nbspto fewer than 40,000 worldwide, of which one in four is captive.\u0026nbspThe letter to Ms May says: “This wondrous, ancient species now stands in our lifetime exhausted,\u0026nbspbeaten and broken, at the end of its long journey, on the very precipice of its existence. Your influence and that of your Defra secretary of state could now yield results to announce to international acclaim at this October\u0027s lllegal Wildlife Trade conference in London, and to show UK global leadership, before it is too late.”A poll for Save the Asian Elephants, taken in June, found 89 per cent of people believed the pajan training for the tourism industry was unjustified\u0026nbspand 87 per cent would avoid a tourist experience if they discovered the elephants had been treated badly.\u0026nbspAs well as the 200,000-strong petition, another 2.6 million people have signed similar petitions against the cruelty.The new campaign is being launched to coincide with World Elephant Day\u0026nbspnext Sunday.A Defra\u0026nbspspokesperson said protecting elephants was a government priority, adding:\u0026nbsp“We take the plight of Asian elephants seriously, which is why we recently met Save the Asian Elephants to discuss what more we can do.\u0026nbspThe Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London later this year will offer us a chance to discuss what action can be taken to support these majestic animals.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/997210_1.jpg","title":"brexit news jacob rees mogg no deal brexit bank of england Mark Carney","story":"A failure to get a deal with the EU means that Britain would go on to what is known as a World Trade Deal using international rules from the World Trade Organisation (WTO).Senior Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the powerful pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), hit out at the Governor who has been facing criticism since he played a key role in George Osborne\u0026rsquos Project Fear campaign during the referendum.Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoMark Carney has long been the high priest of Project Fear whose reputation for inaccurate politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England.Senior Brexiteers have argued that this option is \u0026ldquothe best option because it will mean the UK is completely free of EU red tape and regulations and can strike trade deals around the world.

Parties should do all things to avoid it.Pushed on what no deal would mean for people, Mr Carney said disruption to trade as we know it before adding: As a consequence of that, a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time.Our job at the Bank of England is to make sure those issues don\u0027t happen in the financial system so that people will have things to worry about in a no-deal Brexit, which is still a relatively unlikely possibility but it is a possibility.But what we don\u0027t want to have is people worrying about their money in the bank, whether or not they can get a loan from the bank - whether for a mortgage or for a business idea - and we have put the banks through the wringer well in advance of this to make sure they have the capital.

The government could then concentrate on making free trade agreements with the EU and others over the transition period.In the EU\u0026rsquos no deal preparation notices to stakeholders, Brussels spells out a bleak future where they warn of driving and pilots\u0026rsquo licences becoming invalid, access to the bloc\u0026rsquos airline market rescinded and no mutual recognition of conformity assessment.Britain would have to strike a series of bilateral agreements with EU members because there even with WTO rules if there are no formal relations with the EU then trade is heavily restricted in both directions.For example, without the valid paperwork for goods to circulate in the EU\u0026rsquos market exports would have to named importer inside the bloc to re-certify products \u0026ndash a considerable cost to business.In the wake of Brexit, we look at the 28 member states that are in the European Union.                    Getty1 of 29Countries that are in the European Union Also, a number of foodstuffs would have to be erted to border inspection posts \u0026ndash once again costing time and money.These are known as non-tariff barriers, which modern free trade agreements seek to breakdown in order to facilitate market access. Standards play a large part in this. For example, labelling on cosmetic products sold within the EU must indicate the period after opening for which it is safe to use them.A study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research finds a WTO scenario would cost the UK \u0026ldquo1.77 percent of GBP, which includes the cost of \u0026pound22bn for non-tariff barriers.If the Government can prepare to breakdown non-tariff barriers then WTO rules can be highly profitable, according to the number of studies.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities? What about the destruction of trust in democracy? The inevitable breakdown of law and order? Would riots bother them? Or our great nation being humiliated before the world, scaring itself into surrender and begging Brussels’ forgiveness?Or are they simply in denial about the hideous costs of what they propose?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As Peter Willsman spews out hateful prejudice it goes unnoticed by Corbyn in a way it would not for any other ethnic group.Everything flows from his warped worldview that Israel, America and even Britain are malign forces.It is why Corbyn can approve of a ­blatantly anti-semitic mural. Or see the “hand of Israel” behind Islamist murder. Or call Hamas terrorists “brother” after they have helped slaughter Jews.Or discipline two veteran MPs who accused him over anti-semitism . . . but not an actual anti-semite in Willsman.This is the dark heart of the man Labour wants to install in Downing Street.We don’t just mean the hard-left muppets on his front bench. We mean the Yvette Coopers, Chris Leslies and Chuka Umunnas — all still on Team ­Corbyn, all ready to campaign for Jezza and his vile goons to run this country.And as for the “progressive” millennials who think Corbyn is Christ, how do you like this racist party you’ve joined?Or is Jew-hatred cool, like bringing back Communism and its inevitable horrors?WE like Jeremy Hunt’s punchy tone towards the EU. But he’s wasting his breath.He is right that the chance of no-deal rises every day Brussels, Berlin and Paris continue assuming Britain will eventually surrender to them.We agree that is “a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation”, even if many Remainers WOULD roll over. We also agree the City, the powerhouse of our economy, will thrive come what may.But we get no hint that Merkel or Macron will back Theresa May’s Chequers offer despite its excessive generosity risking her Government’s survival.She is trying to negotiate with people religiously committed to EU ideals, sworn to preserve them against a tsunami of euroscepticism and delusional enough to think punishing us will do it.They will sacrifice their prosperity and voters’ jobs if need be. We see no prospect of a deal with leaders like that.WELL done, Theresa May, for insisting on Brit-only passport lanes post-Brexit.We don’t want to hear Home Office gripes about cost, or UK-only lanes being slower than others. Make them work, as other independent countries do. We will need plenty of visible signs that we have left the EU, and this is one.While we’re at it, let’s get those Brexit stamps printed up for next March.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that you think the scaremongering from the Government is utterly ridiculous.Hell, the Remainers think WE’RE gullible. For having believed the “lies” of the Brexit campaign.But it is hard to imagine anyone could be quite so stupid as to really believe we’ll be short of food if we tell our European friends to shove their deal where the sun doesn’t shine.They even had a debate on Remainer Central (that’s BBC Newsnight to you and me) about what we could put in our sandwiches if we fail to sign a deal. Basically it came down to Kirsty Wark’s toenail clippings and Evan Davis’s nostril hair. That’s your lot.Do they really think we’re that stupid? We’re not at war, you know. We’re just leaving an undemocratic bureaucracy.Do these dingbats really think that the Spanish tomato growers and the Dutch pig farmers are going to refuse to sell us anything? Or that we would refuse to buy their produce? Get real.The debate about whether we should leave or remain in the EU was pretty shoddy. There was exaggeration and outlandish claims made by both sides.I never believed the rubbish about an extra £350million a week for the NHS. And if I’d thought we were going to do that I’d probably have voted Remain. If ever there was a waste of money, that would be it.The difference is, the Remainers believe all the crap that’s spouted by their side. Every bit of it.Just as they believed the economy would be wrecked within a week of the vote. When actually it has been doing very well indeed and is projected to do even better.Sky fallen in yet? Nope. Instead we’re busy sorting out new trade deals with, among others, Japan and Australia. Employment is booming, unemployment is the lowest for decades, wages are rising and inflation is coming down.And so the Project Fearmongers dream up another nightmare scenario which exists only in their weird imaginations. We’ll all starve! No medicines!The threats come from our own remainers — but also from within the EU. Especially (quelle surprise) the awful French.Have you ever known a people more clingy? Listen, mon ami — it’s over, we’re leaving. Our bags are packed and ready in the hallway.It was fun while it lasted (well, actually, it wasn’t THAT much fun) but now we’re going. Try to get over it. And stop the blackmail, you ludicrous little people.Jeremy Hunt — never my favourite politician — has at least started well as our new Foreign Secretary.Warning the EU that it will lose far more than the UK if there’s no deal.No kidding, Jezza.We import far more from the EU than we sell to them. There is not the slightest danger of those imports being prevented from arriving here. To suggest otherwise is utterly absurd.OH God, Madonna’s at it again. Showing off her a*** in a Versace dress.Lying on the ground in stockings with her baps poking out in Vogue magazine.Madge turns 60 in a few days, for gawd’s sake. I have a terrible vision of her doing the same thing in 30 years’ time. Riding a Stannah stairlift wearing a leather basque, with a Gucci colostomy bag.I’m not saying she hasn’t aged well – certainly better than me. But have some dignity, woman.She’s apparently moved to Lisbon to get away from Donald Trump. I think Donald’s well out of it.THE serial anti-Semite Jeremy Corbyn is in trouble again.He has apologised after hosting a meeting where Israel was compared to Nazi Germany.A meeting which took place on Holocaust Remembrance Day! It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson? Disengage with these foul Islamist countries. Leave them to it. Our people have rights.And they supersede the rights of fundamentalist Muslim fanatics to claim asylum in the civilised, Christian, West.SO, the courts have decided that people who don’t necessarily want the right to die can have the right to die if other people think it’s best for them.What a bizarre judgment.This applies largely to elderly people in a locked-in state, that is a persistent vegetative state. If the doctors and relatives think it’s time to turn off the life support, they can now do so.But people sometimes recover from these conditions. And you can imagine the conversation between the docs and rellies, can’t you?Doc: “I’m afraid your dad is showing about as much life as a recently gassed badger. Probably not going to get much better, frankly.”Relly: “Oh, that’s a shame.”Doc: “Yes. And we rather need his bed for another old gadgie who’s about to pop his clogs. Did you like him much, your dad?”Relly: “Um…bit of a miserable old git, really. Cantankerous. Suffered from bad flatulence too, in later years . . .Doc: “Still does!”Relly: “But we’d be very interested in what his . . . you know . . . will has to say. If you catch my drift.”Doc: “Ah, indeed. Well . . . you could find that out very quickly . . .  if I just flicked this switch . . . ”Relly: “Hmm. Well, you know doc, I think it’s what he would have wanted.”Doc: “Exactly. It’s what he would have wanted. Now, say goodbye and contact your lawyer.”THERE’S a new dictionary of rhyming slang.

You could have a tumour on your Samantha.” (Janus).“Well, I did worry about that. Suggested it to the doctor. But he said I was being a silly old Jeremy.”(Our Foreign Secretary).GREAT – the Bush Is Back, according to Vogue magazine.Women are no longer ripping out the furze around their lady- gardens, but letting it all grow. And perhaps adding a rockery, a trellis for roses and a small pond with a plastic heron.About time, really. I’ve always thought there was something ever-so-slightly dodgy about a bloke who liked women shaved bare.I was never much more taken with those landing strips, either.

Most sickeningly, he allegedly patrolled the aisle pointing out protesters to police for removal.Leave aside the police’s appalling complicity . . . though what WERE they thinking? Here was the future Labour leader, reportedly singling out an 80-year-old Holocaust survivor for expulsion for holding views he disliked.For three years  Corbyn’s vile beliefs and associations have shocked Britain.This new outrage, though, must surely be the last straw for self-respecting Labour members who haven’t already quit.TOMMY Robinson is a nasty thug and a grandstanding idiot.He is not a freedom fighter.

That scandal has been exposed by actual journalists.In fact Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, almost wrecked the trial of some accused of serious crime, thus potentially denying both them and their alleged victims justice.Yesterday he was freed on appeal over his contempt of court. Supporters say he was locked up too hastily and for too long. But he was already serving a suspended sentence for the same offence.His many convictions stretch from violence to fraud. We have no sympathy.The case he jeopardised in Leeds had reporting restrictions, temporarily preventing details being publicised. They’re neither unusual nor a politically-correct cover-up. They’re to avoid prejudicing and collapsing other trials linked to it.Robinson blatantly flouted them, was in contempt — and admitted it.Yes, our legal system IS too secretive. On this occasion it was crucial in the interests of justice.It’s time his supporters grasped it.WHAT a surprise. Remember  the scare story that Brexit would kill 200,000 City jobs?Now the City of London Corporation forecast is 5,000. Even they may not happen.

The heaviest smokers spend four per cent of their income on ready-made cigarettes.This was equivalent to around £1,000 in 2014, the latest year studied.Some 15.1 per cent of British adults - 7.4million people - smoke and six in ten want to quit, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.The Government is said to be considering a tax on e-cigs, which are used by 2.8million adults.The study findings are published in the journal BMJ Tobacco Control.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here are his top tips to keep your dinner safe.“It is important to disguise your bag of chips because gulls are smart enough to know what they look like. You could put the chip bag in a carrier bag in order to camouflage it.”“Put a napkin over chips to prevent the grease shining, as the gulls will see that from above. Reduce the amount of vinegar, the liquid increases shine.”“The gulls will spot your shadow, so sit in the shade rather than out in the sunlight. You could choose a shelter or sit beside a building.”“If you are in the park overlooking the sea, make sure you have ground behind you. Avoid the highest ground, where your silhouette can be projected.”“The more spaced-out you are from your mates or family, the less chance there is of the group becoming a target. Gulls swoop on a large bunches of people as they have more chance of grabbing food.”“In the animal kingdom the more still you are, the greater your chance of survival. Movement catches the eye of a predator. The closer the bag of chips is to your mouth, the less movement there will be.”“Holidaymakers must be aware of what is going on above them. In the Army you watch for aircraft, and at the seaside you need to look to the skies for gulls.”“If all else fails, you need to do what an infantry soldier would do if they are ­discovered – fight back. Have a plan so you are not flapping. Keep one hand on the chips because that’s the prize both you and the gull want. Then keep the chip-eating hand free to swipe the gull away.

it is only the proportion used for the scheme which is increasing to at least 29 per cent.A spokesman told The Sun Online that people in war-ravaged Yemen and Syrian refugees currently in Lebanon will benefit.According to the department’s latest report, the UK could be spending more than £300 million per year - £3bn over a decade - on the scheme.The government believes handing refugees cash and debit cards cuts bureaucracy, delivers value for money and gives dignity back to people in need of help.Last year, it was revealed that a similar scheme was being used in Pakistan where people were pictured at ATM machines withdrawing money from the UK government, reports the Daily Mail.However, tens of millions are already spent by other parts of the DfID budget on similar cash transfer initiatives.The scheme in Pakistan is not believed to come out the humanitarian aid budget but another part of the department’s spending.According to the Mail, some people using the cards in the country claimed they had received them after bribing officials.A DfID spokesman said the government uses “robust” checks including biometric technology to eliminate fraud.He said: “UK aid can be the difference between life and death for many of the worlds poorest people, and our cash transfers are helping to eliminate fraud and deliver maximum value for money for UK taxpayers.“We have robust checks, including biometric technology, to make sure every penny of UK aid goes to those who need our help the most and evidence shows that in some cases cash transfers can deliver double the benefits of food aid.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000422917985.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"job seekers refund cash back benefits dwp","story":"Around 4,000 Brits are owed a total of nearly £2million in benefits after a five-year legal fight against the Department of Work and Pensions over their controversial workfare schemes.The schemes made it compulsory for jobseekers to work for free or have their benefits docked.But after graduate Cait Reilly won a landmark Court of Appeal victory over her unpaid work placement in Poundland, the coalition responded by passing an emergency law in 2013 to make the schemes legal.This meant ministers could avoid refunding £130m to those who had had their benefits sanctioned from when the scheme started in 2011 to 2013.A court found in June that this rule change meant a specific group of jobseekers had lost their right to a fair hearing under Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.And now details released under the Freedom of Information Act show between 3,789 and 4,305 people are expected to be paid back £1.7m to £1.9m in lost benefits, the Mirror reports.Those who are eligible for the refund must have been had an appeal in the system by March 26, 2013, against the workfare schemes.Under the new ruling, known as the remedial order, those seeking compensation must also have had their jobseekers allowance sanctioned under that programme.Those who are eligible are unlikely to be able to apply until Spring next year - as Parliament first needs to be consulted this Autumn.The amount claimants are owed depends on your original payment and personal circumstances, so it will vary from case to case.Blogger Frank Zola, who obtained the figures, told the Mirror all those whod been sanctioned under the original schemes should be refunded the full £130million.But the DWP insisted there was no reason to refund all claimants sanctioned between 2011 and 2013.In its FOI response, the department said sanctions are an important part of a fair and effective welfare system.You need to:To find out if you are eligible contact the DWP helpline on 0345 608 8545In a statement the DWP added: It would be unfair and unacceptable that claimants who have failed to take all reasonable steps to increase their chances of finding work obtained advantage over claimants who complied with the benefit conditionality requirements.Today a spokesman added: “We are currently consulting with Parliament on these changes and will publish our response in due course.”If you think you might be eligible, you should call the DWP helpline on 0345 608 8545."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424708943.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"europe heatwave temperatures iberia record latest","story":"The mercury is expected to rise to a burning 46C in Portugal, just fractionally below Californias Death Valley -

And it’s 70 years since we introduced our proudest \u0026shyachievement – the National Health Service. But this week, and like the last few months before it, Labour has been \u0026shydominated by claims and counter claims about anti-Semitism. Before the Houses of Parliament broke for summer, I attended one of the bitterest Labour parliamentary meetings in my 48 years there.  It stemmed from Margaret Hodge calling Jeremy Corbyn a “f***ing anti-Semite” and a “racist” .  I felt compelled to say I utterly rejected her view that Labour is perceived by most Jews, thousands of party members, and millions of members of the public as anti-Semitic and racist. Then we heard anti-Corbyn MP Ian Austin verbally abuse the party chairman Ian Lavery.  And pro-Corbyn supporter Peter Willsman on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee stupidly referred to some Jewish people complaining about anti-Semitism as “Trump fanatics” .    Now we discover that Corbyn spoke at a meeting in 2010 where someone compared the Israeli government to Nazis – even though it was barely reported that the person was Jewish and a Holocaust survivor.   This latest bout of bloodletting over anti-Semitism stems from claims that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism has not been accepted in full by Labour.  Wrong. It was actually accepted in 2016 and has now been replicated word for word in Labour’s code of conduct. And of the 11 working examples given by the IHRA of statements that could be seen as anti-Semitic, Labour has cut and pasted eight of them, and expanded on two-and-a-half of them. Only one half has not been accepted. That could have stopped people accusing the state of Israel of being racist.  But only last week the right-wing Israeli government narrowly passed an appalling Nation State Law that decreed Israel was a Jewish State, effectively making non-Jewish people second-class citizens. It has divided Israeli MPs. And the move, which many described as racist, was condemned around the world. Even the Board of Deputies of British Jews – who have heavily criticised Corbyn – agreed the move was “regressive” and have lodged concerns with the Israeli ambassador.

And the Lanigan family claim its because they are 100 per cent medicine-free.  Antibiotics, painkillers, immunisations and even Calpol are banned by parents Richard and Janette. They even kept one baby out of hospital when doctors told them she was likely to die from whooping cough – and claim the natural nutrients in breast milk kept her alive. Sisters Molly and Isabelle, 14, and Eloise, 11, have never taken part in national immunisation programmes. So they haven’t had jabs for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, haemophilus influenzae, hepatitis B, rotavirus, meningitis B, measles, mumps or rubella. In fact they’ve never even had a Lemsip!  And former chiropractor Richard, 61, insists more families should follow their example. “The evidence clearly demonstrates you can strengthen children’s immune systems by letting them play in the dirt and get infections,” he says. “If my kids’ bread dropped on the floor I’d pick it up and put it back in their mouths. “I strengthen my girls’ immune systems by allowing them to get diseases. “They have less time off than other kids at their school, but that’s not because of one particular thing – it’s a way of life.” He adds: “If you look at how we evolved, humans got stronger by getting illnesses. “The process of natural selection meant the strongest survived. By getting ill it makes us stronger. Natural selection means survival of the fittest – it’s harsh but true.”  If the girls are in pain at the family home in Thames Ditton, Surrey, the strongest treatment Dad prescribes is ice... or maybe a flat Cola because he believes the acid kills bad tummy bacteria. “Ice is the most effective anti-inflammatory and pain relief but there’s no money for the pharmaceutical industry in frozen water so they encourage people to take drugs.” Richard insists: “I am not anti-drugs. You definitely need them in some cases. “But anything in excess damages health. I must be doing something right because it’s unusual to have children who have never needed antibiotics.” And he adds: “If my girls got hit by a bus they’d go to A\u0026ampE – that’s what emergency medicine is good at. “But they’re not so good at healthcare. If they were, we wouldn’t have the rise in autoimmune disorders and chronic illnesses like Type 2 diabetes.”  Though daughter Isabelle had chickenpox as a youngster, the first time any of his kids had painkillers was when Eloise hit her head aged seven and went to A\u0026ampE. Two nurses had to pin her down to give her Calpol because she didn’t know what it was and was so horrified she spat it out. Asked by medical staff if his daughter was allergic to antibiotics, Richard had to admit he had no idea – because she’d never had any. “The nurses were looking at me like a new age freak,” he recalls. “They couldn’t believe that she had never had antibiotics by that age.” Richard even claims he treated his own rectal cancer with cannabis oil after refusing modern treatments and survived despite being given just months to live. He questioned Britain’s reliance on vaccinations after doing a masters in health promotion in 2004.

There’s no better time to explore the very best of the Great British coastline, so pack up the beach toys, grab the sunscreen and get going. Get prepped before you go Before you set off, consider getting a Free Car Check at Halfords to put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too. Pembrey Sands, Wales  Located inside the Pembrey Country Park, this coastal highlight has eight miles of beach and something for everyone. Enjoy the sands in the morning and then head into the woodland for some shade in the afternoon. There are activities here, too, including cycling opportunities, a dry ski slope and an adventure playground. There’s also a campsite if you need a place to pitch your tent for the night. If you don\u0027t already have a tent and you\u0027re not sure where to start, check out the Halfords Tent Selector which will help you find the tent which best suits your needs.   If you\u0027re looking to make your own fun, we suggest an Eco Line Rookie Stunt Kite (above), \u0026pound12.50 – perfect for the sea breeze. Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk  Its name is unusual but Wells is one of the nicest beaches the UK has to offer. A miniature railway will appeal to kids but also provides a great way to get from the town to the beach during peak season. An adventure playground will keep the little ones busy while you wait for the train. Before you leave the car though, make sure you install the Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield, \u0026pound7.99 – it will help keep the temperature in your car down while it\u0027s parked in the coastal sun. Wells-next-the-Sea beach is part of the Holkham Estate and the nearby nature reserve consists of nearly 10,000 acres. There\u0027s loads of important nature here, with salt marshes, sand dunes and pine trees – originally planted to help protect the dunes.  Pack the Halfords Beach Hut 4 Pole Compact Windbreak (above), \u0026pound45 - it\u0027s perfect for carrying to the beach as it comes in a short carry bag with each pole in three sections ready the snap together. Kynance Cove, Cornwall  Kynance Cove isn’t the biggest beach that Cornwall has to offer, but the giant rocks that pepper the beach and caves worn into the rock by the turquoise sea make it well worth a visit. There are cliff walks all around the area, too.  A day on the beach, walking and exploring, can be thirsty work. The Halfords 40 Litre Mains and 12V \u0026amp 24V Electric Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (shown above) is easy to lug about thanks to durable wheels and a pull out handle.  The coolbox is able to cool up to 16 degrees C below the ambient temperature ensuring that your drinks and snacks are kept cool even on a warm day. It can be powered either from 240V mains or by a 12V in-car or 24v in-truck cigarette plug.  Durdle Door Beach, Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a stretch of Dorset and Devon that has 185 million years of geological history. The first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton was found there my Mary Anning and her brother Joseph – she found the torso after he had found the skull a year previously. If your kids are into dinosaurs and natural history, this is the place to visit. Durdle Door Beach offers views of the famous limestone arch just off the coast. The beach itself is accessed by a fairly challenging set of stairs cut into the cliff, so bear in mind it won\u0027t be suitable for very young children or pushchairs. Consider Lulworth Cove instead, if you\u0027re worried about the tricky climb down. Whitby Beach and Sandsend, Yorkshire  A beautifully clean beach that\u0027s easily accessible for families. Walk around 2.5miles up Whitby Beach and it’ll become the slightly quieter Sandsend. There are lifeguards here in the peak season and the sand makes it ideal for little ones to paddle and explore. The promenade features colourful beach huts and gives a handy walkway if the tide is in. There are plenty of places to eat, too.  Whitby is also credited with giving Captain Cook his love of the sea, after he moved to the town to be an apprentice to coal shipping seaman John Walker. Take the Urban Escape Folding Chair (above) - now half price at \u0026pound20 and on offer at two for \u0026pound30 - which is perfect for relaxing in as the waves lap the shore. St Andrews West Sands, Scotland    Stunning views and Scotland\u0027s famous architecture are all on display around St Andrews and its beautiful beach. A ruined castle is nearby, to give you something else to explore if you want a break from games on the beach and the natural beauty of this amazing coastline. St Andrews is, of course, famous for being the home of golf. It also houses one of the UK\u0027s best universities. Famously, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at St Andrews. Your beach walk may well have been one that the young couple enjoyed themselves as students.  Keeping food and drink cool at the beach in summer is a challenge. The Halfords Stripe Cool Bag (above) - now half price at \u0026pound7.50 - will help keep everything fresh until lunch. Mellon Udrigle, Scotland  Worth a visit for the name alone, Mellon Udrigle offers the advantages of the Scottish Highlands and might be a nice break from the summer heatwave. Temperatures in Mellon tend to be a lot lower than most of the UK, so it makes a lot of sense if you\u0027re more about dramatic beauty than sunning yourself.  Gentle dunes and grasses make a for a picturesque beach, but there are also rock pools which kids will adore. They might find crabs, starfish and all manner of other little beasts to inspect – just pop them back where you got them from! Keep your valuables dry with the OverBoard Waterproof Dry Pouch (above), from \u0026pound2.99. It\u0027s super durable and easily buckles onto your belt or bag loops, making it ideal for chilling on the beach.  Botany Bay, Kent  Something of a hidden gem, Botany Bay offers sandy beaches and plenty of exploring fun. The cliffs have smugglers’ caves cut into them, sealed up now, but worth a story or two about the days of covert contraband. Your kids will be fascinated and excited by things to see and do here. Wait for the tide to go out and you can all explore the rock pools, looking for creatures and cooling off their toes in the summer sun. Speaking of sun, you’d do well take some shade with you – particularly for the little ones in your beach party. The Halfords Infant Playshade (below), \u0026pound25, offers 50+ UV protection for children, while the Olpro Beach Hut, \u0026pound70, can keep the whole family covered on scorching days.    This picture-perfect beach is ideal for the kids to run around on. TripAdvisor named it the fourth-best beach in Europe (and the best in the UK), in 2015. The beach was used to train troops in landings during the Second World War, and you can find a memorial to the soldiers at the northern end of the beach. If you\u0027re a surfing family then Woolacombe Beach has great waves, thanks to the Atlantic Ocean – don\u0027t forget to pack your wetsuits! If you’re feeling less brave, pack a Nerf Mega Howler, \u0026pound12.50, for the beach. You’ll be amazed at how far it will fly, thanks to its aerodynamic design. Finger grips make it easy to throw and the noise will delight dogs and toddlers alike. After the beach… Salt water is no friend of the car, so make sure you wash it when you get home. Of course a summer hosepipe ban is likely this year, thanks to record temperatures, so you might want to consider a water-free solution.

They are at the ceremony in Surrey this afternoon, with the day falling on Meghan\u0027s 37th birthday and the Duke of Sussex performing best man duties. Scores of wellwishers sang ‘Happy Birthday to You’ and called out ‘Happy Birthday’ as the Duchess of Sussex arrived at the wedding. Harry\u0027s friend Charlie van Straubenzee - who was an usher when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex tied the knot earlier this year - married partner Daisy Jenks. Harry became friends with Charlie, 30, when the two attended Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire.  Best man Prince Harry, who has been close to van Straubenzee since childhood, wore sunglasses as he stepped into the building among a group of groomsmen. Charlie was an usher at Harry\u0027s recent wedding, along with older brother Thomas van Straubenzee. Best photos from Charlie van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks\u0027s wedding - with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry among the guests Meghan, who is celebrating her 37th birthday today, waved to well-wishers and briefly chatted among other guests outside St Mary the Virgin church in Frensham, Surrey. She wore a \u0026pound400 Club Monaco navy blue short-sleeved dress featuring a pleated colour block skirt and matching fascinator. The shoes were from Aquazzura, a popular brand for the Duchess who wore shoes from the same designer on the evening of her wedding to Prince Harry.  Prince Harry and his wife appear arrived at different times, with the Duke of Sussex seen marching purposefully towards the church - perhaps with best man duties to perform - while Meghan relaxed and enjoyed a joke outside the venue with a number of other women. The Duke of Cambridge is good friends with the van Straubenzee brothers, with Thomas a godfather to his daughter Princess Charlotte. Best photos from Charlie van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks\u0027s wedding - with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry among the guests Bride Daisy Jenks looked to be loving her wedding day as she arrived at the church and made time to wave to crowds and photographers in her white dress. Revd Jane Walker, who led the service, said: “It was a wonderful occasion and Charlie and Daisy looked spectacularly happy. It was a great occasion.” Meanwhile Meghan\u0027s bitter half-sister Samantha Grant has taken another swipe at her younger sibling. Outspoken Samantha, who now goes by Markle, claimed Meghan hadn\u0027t sent her father a birthday card for his birthday on July 18.    It\u0027s thought that Meghan and dad Thomas Markle haven\u0027t spoken since her wedding in May after he took part in a televised interview where he revealed Prince Harry’s views on President Trump and Brexit after phone conversations they had prior to the royal couple’s wedding.  Samantha, who hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan for years, wrote on Twitter: Happy Birthday Meg! It would be so lovely and appropriate of you to send DAD a BELATED birthday card for his July 18 th @Kensingtonroyal Cheers! She\u0027d earlier cruelly called the Duchess Cruella de Vil in another Twitter rant in response to a report about Meghan and Harry retreating from the spotlight.

Police have confirmed a spate of thefts from cars with seven Vauxhall Corsas were targeted in the last week alone.   Thieves reportedly smash the passenger side window to flick the bonnet switch before ripping it off and making off with it, Birmingham Live reports.   It can take less than ten minutes for the crime to be completed and has caused serious anxiety to owners across the region.   One woman whose car was hit, who asked not to be named, said: It happened to me and it\u0027s happening all the time and becoming more common. Thieves strip the whole front on Corsas and Fiestas in particular by breaking the passenger window to pop the bonnet. It can take less than ten minutes to do. She added that she has since been slapped with a \u0026pound400 excess bill from her insurers to pay to fix her pride and joy. The stress and inconvenience it\u0027s caused is unreal and I\u0027m left footing the excess \u0026pound400 bill and been without a car for three days, she explained. It\u0027s known online as Corsa cannibals. I think the more people that are aware, we can stop these vile people.  The craze is believed to have started in 2013 in Bedfordshire when parts were removed from over 500 Corsas.  West Midlands Police said they are investigating. Inspector Mel Sutherland urged Corsa drivers to change the way they park their vehicle to deter criminals.  She said if drivers could park the front end of their car in a way that would prove inaccessible to thieves, it could help deter thieves.  She said: “I would always advise people to check and check again that their vehicle is locked and secure, however given that this type of crime is very specific and unusual I would also encourage people to be extra vigilant and to consider where they are parking their cars. If you have a garage then try and use it or park your car as close to the garage door as possible to prevent thieves getting to the front end of the vehicle to remove it. “You might want to consider upgrading the security on your drive or parking space, investing in a security light or CCTV system needn’t cost the Earth and will be cheaper than replacing the whole front end of your car or seeing an increase in insurance premiums.” "},{"url":null,"title":"daisy jenks marries charlie van","story":"NewsDaisy Jenks marries Charlie van Straubenzee in flower-embellished wedding dress - and of course her bridal bouquet features daisiesPrince Harry was best man and Meghan Markle were both guests of the couple with van Straubenzee a childhood friend of the Duke of SussexShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter18:17, 4 AUG 2018Updated19:19, 4 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Childhood friend of Prince Harry Charlie van Straubenzee has married Daisy Jenks with the royal serving as his best man for the big day.

And the bridal bouquet for the party and wedding videographer, of course, had to include her namesake flowers. On one of the hottest days of the year the guests were all smiles as they waited outside the church in the glorious sunshine. There was no page boys on hand to help the bride with her veil or train but she did have a troupe of young bridesmaids to offer their services should they be required.  After the ceremony, which lasted roughly 45 minutes, Charlie performed his first duty as a newlywed husband - cycling his bride off to the reception in a tricycle. Daisy, who arrived in a black 1951 Mk6 Bentley just before 3.30pm, chose the church, which was consecrated in 1239, as it was where her parents Phillip and Dixie got married and also where she was baptised. Revd Jane Walker, who led the service, said: “It was a wonderful occasion and Charlie and Daisy looked spectacularly happy. It was a great occasion.” Bride Daisy kicked off her career in 2010 when she was hired to film a wedding in Port Isaac.

Getting your hands on the next hit novel before anyone else even knows it exists sounds fantastic. But the job is more than just discovering the next J.K. Rowling, as one publisher has come to find out. Catherine Milne has worked in the publishing industry for several years and is used to reading manuscripts of all kinds.  However she was recently sent a very different kind of manuscript than she is used to.  In a post on Twitter , Catherine shared a book submission sent in by five-year-old Lucy.  She said: I wish we got more submissions like this: Lucy, 5 years old has sent us a book she’s written, about a rabbit named Ruby. Heart, melted. In an interesting move, the book is written all on yellow post-it notes and features Lucy\u0027s own illustrations of a house, the sun and a rabbit.  The girl\u0027s mum reportedly wrote a letter to accompany the submission, which was signed by the young author. It read: Dear Sir/Madam, hello my name is Lucy and I am five-years-old. This is my first book I have written. It\u0027s about a rabbit that saves his friend the dog. Catherine\u0027s tweet has been liked hundreds of times with many people unable to get over just how sweet the idea is.

A Smarties tube read: \u0027What has six legs and lives in the sea?  Inside the packet the answer octopus was printed. Luckily Rose, who lives in Chester, was on hand on point out their embarrassing mistake.

Toni Mansfield was left in unbearable pain when her skin began to peel away during the inking process, and rushed to A\u0026ampE.  The 28-year-old, from Flint in North Wales, initially tried to take legal action against the parlour where the tattoo was done, the Daily Post reports.  But tattooists say the mum-of-three said an allergic reaction was likely to blame. Her hand had begun to swell during her second appointment at the Studio Thir13een parlour in Flint.  Ms Mansfield said she had tried to take legal action against the shop, but because she had signed a disclaimer before she had the work done, her solicitor advised her the case wasn’t likely to go anywhere. The parlour said it was not responsible for the tattoo going wrong, claiming she may have had an allergic reaction to the ink. But Ms Mansfield said when she had had the first session to get the outline done, there had been no problem. She added: “For the next appointment I put on some numbing cream to help with the pain. About an hour in to having it done my hand started to swell and my skin started to come away. “I started to feel really faint because the pain was so bad.

Because it came to light this week that his Home Office is raking in millions charging the children of immigrants more than \u0026pound1,000 each to get the citizenship they are entitled to by right. This blatant profiteering has made the Government a fortune while driving families into debt.

When he was diagnosed I was \u0026shydevastated.” Claire has first-hand experience of dogs sniffing out diseases as her labrador Daisy detected her breast cancer six years ago.

Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 40, has released a tell-all memoir about her tumultuous relationship with the legendary Apple founder who passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011. The book, titled Small Fry, reveals how Jobs initially denied paternity of his daughter but was forced by a judge to pay child-support after a DNA test proved that he had fathered Lisa during his five year on-off relationship with Chrisann Brennan during the 1970s. Lisa wrote in an excerpt published in Vanity Fair: “I was required to take a DNA test. The tests were new then, and when the results came back, they gave the odds that we were related as the highest the instruments could measure at the time: 94.4 percent. The court required my father to cover welfare back payments, child-support payments of $385 per month, which he increased to $500, and medical insurance until I was 18.”  Lisa, born in 1977, says she was forced to move home over 13 times before age seven as her mother struggled to pay the bills through a series of cleaning positions, while Jobs, then already a multi-millionaire, refused to help. “For him, I was a blot on a spectacular ascent,” she writes, “as our story did not fit with the narrative of greatness and virtue he might have wanted for himself. My existence ruined his streak.”  Lisa reveals how she regularly visited her father at his Tudor-style home in Palo Alto in the final 12 months of his life but said she was made to feel like a nuisance during her trips. “I’d given up on the possibility of a grand reconciliation, the kind in the movies, but I kept coming anyway”, she admitted.  During one particular meeting her father cruelly told her she smelled like a toilet after she had sprayed an expensive rose mist on her face in one of Job\u0027s bathrooms. “Before I said good-bye, I went to the bathroom to mist one more time,” she wrote. “The spray was natural, which meant that over the course of a few minutes it no longer smelled sharp like roses, but fetid and stinky like a swamp, although I didn’t realise it at the time.  “As I came into his room, he was getting into a standing position. I watched him gather both his legs in one arm, twist himself 90 degrees by pushing against the headboard with the other arm, and then use both arms to hoist his own legs over the edge of the bed and onto the floor. When we hugged, I could feel his vertebrae, his ribs. He smelled musty, like medicine sweat. “‘I’ll be back soon,’ I said. We detached, and I started walking away. “‘Lis?’” “‘Yeah?’” “‘You smell like a toilet.’”  During childhood, Lisa says her father began visiting her about once a month after he temporarily reconciled with her mother, bringing her roller-skating through the streets of her neigbourhood. During one visit she innocently asked if she could be given his Porche after learning the flashy vehicle had a scratch and need to be replaced. His scowling response shocked Lisa, then aged seven. “‘Absolutely not,’ he said in such a sour, biting way that I knew I’d made a mistake,” she remembers. “I understood that perhaps it wasn\u0027t true, the myth of the scratch: maybe he didn’t buy new ones. By that time I knew he was not generous with money, or food, or words the idea of the Porsches had seemed like one glorious exception.  “I wished I could take it back. We pulled up to the house and he turned off the engine. Before I made a move to get out he turned to face me. “‘You’re not getting anything,’” he said. “‘You understand? Nothing.

The decision was made by energy firm EDF as the extreme heatwave took hold. Four reactors at three power plants were shut due to safety concerns, the company announced. High temperatures registered in the Rhone and Rhine rivers, from which the three power plants pump their water for cooling, led to a temporary shutdown of the reactors, the spokesman said. France, like much of Europe, is experiencing scorching weather in its southern regions, with forecasts showing temperatures reaching 37C in the Rhone valley.

Among the winning projects were improving Perth Road shopping area and footpaths in Baxter Park. More than 40% ofvotes cast came from the 11-25 age group.The report said it was “particularly striking” that more than three quarters of voters had not been involved in a community engagement exercise before.In conclusion, it said: “Overall, Dundee Decides has been an outstanding success and something that will hopefully serve as an inspiration to other local authority areas as they develop their programmes in future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b642080eb763-409x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united in safe hands for the rigours ahead says siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United fans will find out today which of their new goalkeepers has won the battle to start the league season between the sticks.And one of the men involved, Benjamin Siegrist, is happy to let them know in advance that whoever gets the nod, they can rest assured he’ll do a good job for the Tangerines.Whether or not it’s the giant Swiss shot stopper or Slovakian Matej Rakovan, Arabs are also safe in the knowledge they’ll keep each other on their toes all season.Since day one of pre-season training, Siegrist and Rakovan have been fighting hard to convince gaffer Csaba Laszlo they should be No 1 and that’s not going to stop with the visit of in-form Dunfermline.“You need to prepare every week to play,” said the 26-year-old former Aston Villa kid.“You train all week to play on Saturday, so, whatever you face, you know you have done the work during the week and you feel confident about facing it.“I want to play, that’s why I came here. So does Matej and it’s been a good relationship.“Along with Neil Alexander, our coach, we have a goalie union and it is a fun working environment.“At the end of the day we all support each other and, whoever plays, that continues.“It’s good competition and it’s good for the team.“We prepare in training and whoever is picked, they will do their best. This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"folk to get their say on final phase of regeneration project

She is now studying towards her degree in business management at university in her spare time while working.She said: “If someone doubts me I try to prove them wrong.“I wasn’t too bothered about exam results because I just focused on getting a pass. Even if my friend got an A and I got a C, the fact I have passed is an achievement.”Throughout college, Melissa balanced working part-time and being a mum, saying: “I think the school system and social media adds to the pressure of it all.“You only see the people who get A grades on the news.“There are so many alternative pathways to get where you want if you don’t get the qualifications you need at school, for example apprenticeships and college.“There are always opportunities as you learn other skills on the job.”The campaign launch comes after Childline revealed it had held more than 1,000 counselling session for students worried about exams this year.The Childline centres in Aberdeen and Glasgow also dealt with more than 250 contacts – up by 28% compared to the previous year.Jayne Laidlaw, Childline manager for the Glasgow base, said: “Children and young people can feel incredible pressure during the exam period and this can turn to extreme anxiety around results time, especially if their marks don’t match up to their expectations or hopes.“They can often think these exams represent their last chance to make something of their lives, but this is not the case.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"only five players remain from when mccann took charge but dundee far from the finished article","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than a year into the job and with plenty of players in and out, Dundee boss Neil McCann is beginning to feel this squad is his own, though he admits they’re “far from the finished article”.Only five first-team players remain since Neil took the reins at Dens Park in June 2017 – Cammy Kerr, Darren O’Dea, Paul McGowan, Jesse Curran and Craig Wighton.After two summer windows – still four weeks to go in the current one – and a winter transfer period, it’s clear the Dens gaffer has put his own stamp on the side, though he admits he’s still got work to do on that front.He said: “The squad has evolved since I came in.“A lot of those boys that were here when I came in served me great.“When I’ve asked them to come in and do a job, they gave me everything but a lot of those boys have decided, when they’re not featuring regularly, they want to move on, and have.“I’m still looking to bring in some more but I’m pleased with the group I have just now.“You want to mould a team and how it wants to play and it has to be your team – there’s no point coming in and trying to use the previous manager’s ideas and ways he wants to play, it has to be your own.“I’m getting to the stage where I’m seeing things coming, but we need to bolt lots together because we’re far from the finished article.”Neil has been clear in his pursuit of further options at left-back and up front.Former Morton defender Mark Russell is in on trial along with former West Brom forward Adil Nabi.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b641fc89a99f-e1533298226211.jpg ","title":"today

places where Macbeth walked and which are integral to his story.“I will be doing this during the duration of my show which lasts from tomorrow until August 22.“It means some very long days and nights

games area will be built on the former tennis courts, on the south side of the park.Plans include a playground space for different activities as well as basketball hoops and goal posts.The facility is expected to be similar to a games area created at Baxter Park in Stobswell in 2014, which cost £187,000.Details of the project were first revealed by Broughty Ferry councillor Kevin Cordell in 2017.He said: “The community has worked very hard for this and I was happy to facilitate meetings with officers and elected members throughout the process.“I know the multi-use games area will be a welcome addition to the local community and will encourage more children to enjoy the park, in safety.“The fantastic proposals are testament to the determination of the local community and council officers.”As part of the Dundee Decides initiative, which saw residents across the city decide how £1.2 million would be spent through the community infrastructure fund, extra lighting will also be installed along the pathways in the park.The Broughty Ferry ward voted to spend £25,000 of its budget allocation on lighting the paths.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “We’re committed to improving our parks, play equipment and providing new spaces for communities.“We invest hundreds of thousands of pounds every year to make that a reality and I’m pleased that we have been able to work on delivering the Gillies Park multi-use games area.“These are really exciting proposals that are important to making the Ferry look and feel more attractive, while also making Gillies Park safer by installing lighting around the park.”Over the last five years, Barnhill Tenants’ and Residents’ Association has been trying to improve Gillies Park.The group secured £70,000 of funding from the council’s neighbourhood services towards the multi-use games area.A sub-group made up of members of the association carried out door-to-door canvassing in the community to find out if residents would support the project.It started campaigning for the multi-use games area to be created two years ago and today welcomed the successful planning bid.Audrey Murphy, who was chairwoman of the association during the fundraising campaign, said: “We are very grateful for the support we received from Barnhill Primary School, local councillors, former councillor Laurie Bidwell and members of the

lack of visible progress to tackle the former Eastgate Hostel which went up in flames in April 2013.Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice lies just beyond the eyesore site in Stephens Brae, is now calling for a meeting take place this month at the Inverness Town House at which the public can be given a full update, with Highland Council officers and the building\u0027 owners present.\"It is time someone told us exactly what is happening,\" he said. \"It has been going on for more than five years. We keep being told something is going to happen but then nothing ever does.\"A planning application was lodged with the council earlier this year to remove scaffolding and demolish the remaining structure ahead of reconstruction. But hopes that work would start as early as June were dashed when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet about the proposal.Mr Crawford said he and other nearby traders had been kept mainly in the dark throughout the ongoing saga. He also wants the Inverness Common Good Fund to be used to acquire the building.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Central councillor Bet McAllister said she and her colleague Janet Campbell have attended meetings with council officials and the owners in a bid to resolve the situation. She felt an open meeting would be interesting and fiery.\"We are as frustrated as everyone else,\" she said. \"We are at the end of our tethers. We cannot keep having meetings and then nothing happens.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"We recognise the importance of that site. That is why we have ploughed significant support in kind to the owners and their agents to find a solution.\"We have to recognise this is a privately-owned building and the owners recognise their responsibilities. It is not an easy situation.\"He urged Mr Crawford to get in contact with him.\"I will be glad to talk through the concerns and issues with him,\" he said.Saturday 4 Aug 2018 8:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116732.jpg","title":"Conservation charity calls for oberhaul tp planning laws","story":"\u0026nbspA LEADING conservation charity has warned that Scotland\u0027 heritage is in danger of being ridden roughshod over with plans being submitted for four new developments close to Culloden Battlefield.The applications, which include a 13-lodge holiday and leisure centre, come in the wake of controversial plans being approved for 16 new homes at Viewhill Farm near to the battlefield.\u0026nbspThe National Trust for Scotland is now calling on the Scottish Government to overhaul the planning system.Simon Skinner, the charity\u0027 chief executive, said previously raised fears regarding the protection of Scotland\u0027 heritage were coming to pass.\"The specific development of the Viewhill Farm luxury houses at Culloden does not in itself fatally impinge on the battlefield but it sets a precedent from which other developers can argue for more portions of land to be given over to yet more housing,\" he said.The four new applications are all located in the conservation area. In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it. That can only be achieved by overhauling the current diffuse focus on individual planning applications in isolation.\"Now is the time to make that change. The forthcoming Planning (Scotland) Bill is the point of no return for Scotland\u0027 heritage.

bakery publishes biography","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe founder of a beloved north-east bakery has proved his baking prowess by publishing an autobiography.J George Ross, who founded JG Ross Bakery, has published his life story in a book called An Unlikely Lad.It tells of his journey from childhood to boss of one of the north-east’s best-loved institutions.The businesses started in 1962 when George and wife Betty bought a struggling bakery in Premnay.Since then the bakery has gone from strength to strength and it is now run with sons Graeme and Cameron at the helm.George said: “As the business grew there seemed to be a perception that my father had started the business and I was the second generation.“My immediate family and some of the grandchildren suggested I should set the record straight and write a book detailing the growth of the business from its inception, purely for future generations.\u0026#8220That is what I started doing a few years ago.”However, the buttery baron has now made his memoirs available to the public and even has plans to publish a second book.He said: “Following the book tour, I give a brief talk on the history of the company and a question and answer session.\u0026#8220A question often asked is about my life before starting in business.“This prompted me to start my book from my earliest memories, growing up in the village of Daviot, or ‘Davit’ as it was called.“This means of course that the book is bigger than I first planned, so I have decided it will have to be two books.\u0026#8220This first book will take you up to 1987.“I chose the title because I didn’t have a business background and although I always intended having my own business it may well have seemed unlikely to others“I never kept a diary so I am writing purely from memory.“It was never my ambition to be a baker but from an early age I had decided I wanted to be my own boss.“I was involved in the baking industry from an early age, purely by chance, so when the time came to set out on my own it made sense to stick to what I knew.”All proceeds from the book will go towards the JG Ross Foundation, which considers financial requests from local organisations.The books are now available to buy at Highclere and selected JG Ross shops.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"future midwives invited to university open day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA university in Aberdeen is to open its

proposal lodged","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group has put forward a formal request to purchase a former school building and turn it into a community hub.The Garioch Partnership is looking to take over the former Market Place Primary School in Inverurie – which has lain empty for nine months – and transform it into a community hub.The school has been empty since last October when pupils transferred to the new Uryside Primary School due to overcrowding.The group has made an asset transfer request to Aberdeenshire Council to purchase the building, which is still owned by the local authority.The former school was to be demolished and the space transformed into a car park.A notice of the request, which has been published publicly, stated: “The proposed use of the building is to develop it as a third sector hub, to enable community groups, local people and local small enterprises to have a common space to work together.”The public was invited to make representations into the plans up until yesterday.These will be considered by councillors at the end of this month.A statement, previously issued by the group when it launched a petition to gain support for the plan, read: “We’d like to provide Garioch with the space it deserves for communities to meet and come together – at affordable prices.“It’s called a third-sector hub but in simple terms it would be a place for groups – small and large – to come together, share space, interact with each other, learn together and laugh together.”The Garioch Partnership also hopes the plan will provide the opportunity to offer start-up space for some small businesses to use, right in the heart of the town.An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “We can confirm we have received a community asset transfer request from The Garioch Partnership to buy the former Inverurie Market Place School building to use as a community hub.“The next steps are for a report to be considered by the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday August 28.”The Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 introduces a right for community groups to make requests to all local authorities for any land or buildings they feel they could make better use of.The council has a responsibility to assess each request transparently against a specified list of criteria and agree to the request unless there are reasonable grounds for refusal.The school dates back to 1895 and housed evacuees during the Second World War.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors praise club staff after visit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from a north-east out-of-school-club have been

April to teach motorbikers tips and tricks on how to keep safe on the road.Twelve riders are completing the one-day course in Inverurie today, with help from the North East Police Division\u0026#8217s road policing unit.The course is part funded by Transport Scotland.The course is led by qualified police motorcyclists and take place throughout the summer.Road Policing Chief Inspector Stewart Mackie called the courses a \u0026#8220life saver\u0026#8221.He added: “Across Tayside, Grampian and Highland and Islands we benefit from some of the most beautiful scenery in the country, which attracts motorcyclists both near and far to visit our area and enjoy riding their bikes. #\u0026#8220However, it is both a sad and shocking fact that a significant number fatal collisions in the north area of the country involve motorcyclists.“With the onset of better weather, more motorcyclists will be out on the roads and we want to not only promote safe riding messages, but also encourage riders to think about their riding style and riding behaviour, and take advantage of the expert tuition and advice that we will be providing on our course.“The course is a one-day training event which we have specifically designed to give riders advice and tuition on how to ride more safely when out on the local road network.“Led by police motorcyclists, the course will look at key risk factors particular to the local area plus there will be demonstration rides and filmed rides with feedback from the officers afterwards.“The aim of the course is to develop the skills of the riders and improve their safety on the roads.\u0026#8220We also hope to encourage riders to use this as a stepping stone to other motorcycle training courses that are offered by partner organisations and private enterprises.“This is the only course of its kind being offered in Scotland at the moment and I hope that it will influence the behaviour of those who attend the course and help them to become safer riders.”Neil Greig, policy and research director of IAM Road Smart (formerly the Institute of Advanced Motorists) said: ”Skills development is key to safe motorcycling on Scotland’s challenging northerly routes.\u0026#8220Riders have a great deal of respect for highly trained police motorcyclists and are often keen to try and replicate their level of ability.\u0026#8220Such schemes are also one of the most popular entry points for riders seeking to enhance their skills by joining us at IAM RoadSmart and we are very happy to work with Police Scotland to offer riders that opportunity.\u0026#8221The next course takes place in Elgin on September 8 and costs £30 per person.Anyone interested in attending the course should

will have its world premiere at a prestigious film festival later this year.Stan \u0026amp Ollie is the third feature film from Peterhead’s Jon S Baird and tells the story of legendary comedy duo Laurel and Hardy.The film, which stars Steve Coogan and John C Reilly, will make its debut on October 21 at the closing-night gala of the 62nd BFI London Film Festival.Jon told The Evening Express: “I’m absolutely delighted that Stan \u0026amp Ollie will be closing the London Film Festival.“It’s a real honour for me to be having the world premiere in a city that’s so close to my heart, as I know it was to Laurel \u0026amp Hardy also.“I can’t wait for people in the north-east to see it in January as they have always been very supportive of my films, which I’m extremely grateful for.”The film follows the Hollywood comics as they travel around the UK and Ireland on their “farewell” tour in 1953.Laurel, played by Coogan, and Hardy, played by Reilly, have to deal with initially disappointing attendances and Hardy’s failing health.The problems threaten to overwhelm their partnership as the two men attempt to reconnect with each other, in addition to their fans.Co-starring Shirley Henderson and Nina Arianda as the duo’s wives Lucille and Ida, Stan \u0026amp Ollie was written by Jeff Pope, who was nominated for an Oscar alongside Steve Coogan for 2013’s Philomena.The BFI London Film Festival’s artistic director Tricia Tuttle said: “We’re delighted to be closing the BFI London Film Festival with this beautiful tribute to cinema’s early comedy odd couple, Laurel and Hardy.“A truly funny and touching story about a tender life-long friendship, Jon Baird’s film is also a must for movie fans, exploring the twilight years of two megawatt performers who had a meteoric rise to fame.“These two prove that true comic timing is eternal, and it’s a perfect end to the festival.”Jon grew up in Peterhead and attended Meethill Primary, as well as Peterhead Academy.After he graduated from university in Aberdeen he immediately moved down to London to break into the movie business.He has previously received acclaim for his 2013 adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel Filth and in 2015

However, the development fee the Dons will have to pay Hamilton for Turf Moor goal hero Ferguson will be decided by an SPFL tribunal on August 21.In contrast, Rangers have splashed in excess of £5 million this summer in a bid to overtake the Reds, who finished Premiership runners-up.McInnes reckons this has prompted many pundits to predict the Ibrox club will overtake them in Scotland’s pecking order – especially in light of the Glasgow outfit’s dealings in the transfer market.He has other ideas.McInnes said: “If you listen to what everyone else is saying, that we are going to be this and that and we are going to finish here in the league and we need this player or we need that player.“However, there is enough here, in personality and confidence, within that team to suggest to me that we are going to have a good season.“We will try to bring good reinforcements in but the squad is strong and we aim to show that this season.”There is no better arena to show that in than a season opener against Rangers.Ultimately, it is just three points – the season will not be defined by this game – but a win could certainly represent an early marker and statement of intent.Last season Aberdeen took just one point from 12 against a Rangers side beset by problems behind the scenes.“When you saw the ovation from the supporters at the end (of the Burnley tie), it was not just in recognition of the players’ efforts and quality of performance,” he said.“It was also that they see, something in this squad they can be excited about for the season ahead.“And there is no better game to try to get off (to a good start) and feel better about ourselves than by winning against Rangers.“That will be tough but it is a brilliant game to be involved in and may be just the perfect game after the disappointment of losing to Burnley.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mckenna good enough to star in england","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSkipper Graeme Shinnie has no doubt wanted man Scott McKenna could cut it not just in the Championship but the English top flight – although he hopes the defender stays at Pittodrie.Swansea have already approached Aberdeen to inquire about the availability of the 21-year-old centre-back.The Championship outfit are lining up a £2 million bid for the Scotland international before the transfer window closes in England on August 9.McKenna will face Rangers in the Premiership opener at Pittodrie tomorrow as the Reds aim to bounce back from their Euro exit.Aberdeen suffered massive disappointment when losing 3-1 after extra-time to Burnley at Turf Moor to exit the Europa League 4-2 on aggregate.Shinnie reckons the way McKenna shackled the Clarets big-money strikers, including £15m signing Chris Wood, proves he can hack it in England’s top flight.He only hopes that move comes a long way down the line and that tomorrow’s clash with Rangers at Pittodrie is not McKenna’s last for the Reds.Shinnie said: “Scott McKenna and Mikey Devlin were brilliant again in what was a tough task with the physicality of the two Burnley boys up front.\u0026#8220But they dealt with it brilliantly and that gave us the platform in the game.“Scott could go to a Premier League team (in the future), as he showed what he can do against a Premier League team in Burnley.“However, he is a level-headed guy as well and wants to rack up as many games as he can, which is really positive for a young player.\u0026#8220He wants to get the experience and wants to get the games.“There is no doubt he will probably end up going at some point but we will hold on to him as long as we can.”Aberdeen rejected an offer in excess of £1 million from Hull City for Scotland cap McKenna during the January transfer window. Since then he has made his international breakthrough and captained Scotland in a 1-0 summer friendly loss to Mexico.McKenna will be at the heart of the defence in a game against Rangers that marks new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard’s first domestic game.After the disappointment of losing at Turf Moor, skipper Shinnie challenged the Reds to bounce back with a victory.He said: “Pittodrie will be packed for Rangers and it is a good game to have off the back of the Euro tie.“We need to put that (loss to Burnley) at the back of our minds.“It is a massive game but that is what it is like at Aberdeen – big games come thick and fast.“We know the crowd will be there in their numbers so it is another game where we have to step it up.”Aberdeen were up against a side with an immensely superior budget in Burnley, who have a £37m players’ wage budget.Tomorrow the figures may be smaller but there is still a gulf between the budget of Rangers and that of Aberdeen.The Ibrox club have backed Gerrard’s rebuilding by sanctioning transfers in excess of £5m during the summer.There have also been high-profile loan deals that will require high wages.Shinnie does not care about the cash the Ibrox club are splashing out, though.On the disparity between the two club’s budgets, he said: “That is out of our control and we just focus on ourselves.“The games against Burnley have been positive for us and we look to take that momentum into the league.”Aberdeen may have been knocked out of Europe but Shinnie reckons they regained some pride for Scottish football.It is a tie he believes the Dons deserved to win over the two legs to book a third qualifying round clash against Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey.He said: “In Scotland teams know what we are all about – we have proved that over the last couple of years.“Maybe we have now shown people down in England what Scottish football is all about.“It is not as bad as what the English make it out to be.“But in Scotland, in terms of us, we have shown what we are all about.“We have got a big season ahead of us again to show that.”Aberdeen may have been underdogs against Premier League Burnley but, make no mistake, there was a belief in this squad they could progress.It was this confidence which made losing out in extra time all the more difficult to take for the Aberdonian, particularly as the Reds had opportunities to win the tie.He said: “We are gutted that we did not get through because that is what we wanted and what we set out to achieve.“No matter who it was against, we wanted to get through and we had the opportunities to do that.“It is disappointing but we will take the positives.“We can be proud of what we did… but it wasn’t good enough.“At the start of the game Burnley were good, although we didn’t start great in the first half.“Once we got to grips with the game, we got right into it.“In the second half, again, we didn’t start overly great but went on to be the better team and create the better chances.I thought, over the two legs, we were probably the better team but we didn’t take our chances and, in the end, that kills you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"turning a profit with added value wind turbines","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/07/18, 6:30 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowRegular artistic contributor Ann Thomas from Tarbert this week turns her imagination to the growing presence of wind turbines in our countryside around Argyll.Ann muses that they might be turned into tourist attractions along the lines of the London Eye, with the speed of rotation determined by the vagaries of the weather.Could this be a potential source of added value and extra cash for our community wind turbines?\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 1:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On the afternoon of July 2, my car overturned in Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig.Fortunately, I was not injured but I would like to thank the emergency services \u0026#8211 ambulance and police \u0026#8211 neighbours and workmen who pulled me out of the car after smashing the glass.Everyone was so helpful.I didn’t get your names but appreciate your help.We have a wonderful community here in Argyll.Anne Lavelle, Ardrishaig.Sir,I would like to thank everyone who made last Friday\u0026#8217s quiz night in aid of the Lochgilphead Celtic and Pictish Festival such a success.Thanks to Stan at the Stag Hotel for providing the room and a round of drinks for the winners.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good.

Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players.

Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert tourist icentre to shut in october","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 9:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert\u0026#8217s tourist information centre will close in the autumn \u0026#8211 five months earlier than expected.The doors will close on October 27 this year, rather than in March 2019 as widely expected.The controversial decision to close a number of iCentres across Argyll, including those in Tarbert, Campbeltown and Inveraray, follows a recorded drop in footfall, according to the country\u0026#8217s tourism agency VisitScotland.Tarbert residents reacted angrily to the news, with one commenting on social media: ‘How can our small businesses grow when they are not being promoted?’Tarbert shop owner Ian MacIntyre agreed, saying the move ‘didn’t make a lot of sense’.He added: ‘I can’t understand why they’d close the centre in Tarbert.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable. And it had to happen on what seems like one of the busiest days of the year. “There are other Morrisons in Troon and Kilmarnock, you would think they could get an emergency supply from them, but apparently not.” The bustling store in the town’s Castlehill Road stopped selling 5p bags in a bid to go green and re-use the stronger 10p bags.

Dalmilling Golf Club in Ayr is now planning to honour Glenn Wilson’s awesome achievement. He scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par. That equalled Sean Ryan’s round seven years ago and Glenn said: “I thought I was playing well, but not this well. “I love golf and cannot get enough of it.” He bagged an ace during the July Saturday Bowl at the lucky-for-him 13th. Yet at the second hole he scored a potentially card-wrecking double bogey 6. Glenn said: “My drive at the second landed in a divot and I ended up catching it thin and going into the bushes at the back.” He got hooked on golf six years ago when he picked up an old club and started hitting balls in the field near his home in Dalmilling. Three years ago he joined Dalmilling as a member and has played most days since then. His handicap has gradually gone down from 19 to the present six. That meant his score in the July Bowl was a net 55, blowing any opposition out of the water. His inward nine was just 28 strikes. Club secretary Tommy Swan says everyone is very proud of their “superstar.” He added: “This is an outstanding achievement, a magnificent score for a 15-year-old. “I’d say it was even more special because he double-bogied the second hole. “That would have wrecked most players, but Glenn stuck at it. “He started out at Dalmilling with only a few clubs, but has gradually built a set. And he is so keen on the game that he also volunteers to help the green-keeping staff on a regular basis. “We are planning something in his honour.” Glenn, of Thorneyflat Street, is in his fourth year at Ayr Academy and is cheered on by his three sisters and one brother. Parents Linda and Glenn are suitably proud of their starlet.  He is keen to make golf  his living and already represents his club in Ayrshire Golf Association competitions.  The next step would be to try for the Ayrshire Boys team. At the moment he is volunteering with the greenkeeping staff as part of his Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. And he casually admits that the hole in one was not his first, but his THIRD.  Most golfers don’t get one in their entire playing days and Glenn said: “I play  every day and I love Dalmilling.   “This was my first hole  in one during a competition.  “But I have just had two others, both at the eighth at Dalmilling, with my pal Adam Cambers and my uncle John Strachan.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"group-is-chuffed-with-plans-for-railway-museum","story":"THE wheels are in motion to honour Peebles\u0026rsquo historic railway by creating a museum in the town.\nIn recognition of the prosperity the railway brought to the community, members of the Peebles Community Trust (PCT) are hoping to transform the former weigh bridge, located in Edinburgh Road car park, to house the railway archive dating back to 1855.\nThe development of Peebles owes a great deal to the railway, which made its final stop in 1962. During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact PCT co-coordinator Alex Wilson at admin@peeblescommunity.org\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

The Delgados star Emma Pollock and sensational new artist Bryde.\nAnd you can enjoy the show for free.\nOn The Brinck Promotions are hoping to stage a monthly showcase at Innerleithen Memorial Hall.\nAnd they have lined up a cracking triple bill to get the ball rolling.\nPhil Walker from On The Brinck Promotions told us: \"We\u0027re hoping these events will happen monthly and will feature some big comedy tour shows as well as the best in upcoming music.\n\"We are trying to increase engagement with the arts by making these events free entry - where possible - and then asking for donations at the end - in a similar way to Free Fringe shows at the Edinburgh Fringe festival.\n\"We think that Innerleithen is ideally placed, between Peebles and Galashiels, with good transport links to make shows that, otherwise you would have to travel to Edinburgh or Glasgow to see, more accessible.\"\nPollock was a founding member of The Delgados more than 20 years ago.\nAnd she was also a driving force in the formation of the highly-influential Chemikal Underground label.\nFor the past 13 years Emma has continued to be one of Scotland\u0027s best-loved and consistent performers and songwriters.\nAnd her latest album, In Search of Harperfield, was shortlisted for a The SAY Award.\nIn Innerleithen, Emma will be share the billing with Bryde, who is fresh from performances at Latitude Festival, Deer Shed Festival, Standon Calling Festival, LEOPALLOOZA, Ynot Festival, Boardmasters, Bingley Music Live, 110 Above Festival and a sold out London headline show at the amazing OMEARA.\nIn support will be talented local singer-songwriter Millie, who hails from Peebles.\nPhil added: \"There is an existing music community in Innerleithen with brilliant places like The Vale Club and The Traquair Arms hosting regular music nights as well as the superb annual Innerleithen Music Festival and it would be great if we could add to this and work together to encourage more people to support these events.\n\"If people are interested in coming along they can register for free tickets at www.onthebrinck or call 07930 275891 to have their name added to the guest list.\n\"There will also be physical tickets to collect in person from the wonderful No 1 Peebles Road in Innerleithen.\"\nBryde, Millie and Emma Pollock will play Innerleithen on Friday, September

haunt of many writers down the centuries, including Rabbie Burns and Sir Walter Scott.\nAfter its closure in 2006, a community group was formed to fight plans to demolish sections and convert parts into housing.\nFollowing years of legal wrangles and funding applications the community purchased the historic building in 2013.\nIt was hoped that the Tweedsmuir Community Company would raise the required \u0026pound2 million to turn the Crook into a major tourist destination and hub for Tweedsmuir.\nBut the group has now changed course with a phased plan of development - starting with the conversion of the former steading building into a cafe.\nThe group also wants to create a bunkhouse in the former staff quarters during phase one.\nDuncan Davidson, chairman of Tweedsmuir Community Company, told us: \"Developments are afoot for the Crook Inn.\n\"Although we now have great designs, with planning permission, for complete renovation to create a Crook Inn Community Hub, the funding for the complete renovation has not been obtained.\n\"So we are developing a phased plan of redevelopment to convert the previous steading building into a caf\u0026eacute to serve the local community and tourism and for a new-build bunkhouse in the previous staff accommodation.\"\nFunding from the Scottish Government\u0027s Strengthening Communities Programme has enabled the Tweedsmuir Community Company to appoint the highly-regarded heritage and business company, Jura Consultants, to assist with business planning and obtaining further funding.\nThe community group is also looking to appoint a part-time Community Development Officer for an initial six months to help with community support and development.\nFurther information on the post can be obtained from Mr Davidson on 07783342302 or

Ian performed in their former years as a seven-piece folk orchestra called Patchy Sanders, which took them far and wide through the journey of songwriting and touring.\nAfter the folding of Patchy Sanders, the duo decided to take their love of songwriting and performing down to the bones, and used their acoustic instruments and voices to write the material for their first album, Hunter

transport you into their haunting and beguiling world of love tales and spine-tingling harmonies.\n\"They will have you travelling far and wide to hear them again.\nTheir first tour through Europe in 2016 brought them from Spain to Ireland\u0026mdash hitting small towns, far-reaching islands, and the greater metropolitan areas.\nTravelling with a nanny and Eowyn, their 5-year-old budding fiddler daughter, they played at cultural centres, pubs, and popular concert series.\nAnd the trip acted as a reconnaissance for the duo as they discovered their family history in Ireland and Scotland and began to collect the traditional songs of the people.\nThis spark of song collecting re-inspired their love of storytelling and performing intimate, acoustic concerts and infiltrated their repertoire of original songs with a smattering of uniquely interpreted traditional songs.\nFellow Pynins\u0026rsquo music employs the sounds of the mandolin, banjo, guitar, bouzouki and their voices in harmony to tell the stories of this human existence.\nThey will be touring through the UK and Ireland, playing 26 concerts in August, once again collecting lesser known traditional songs and gracing the stages from Cambridge Folk Festival to the mystical island of Iona.\nOn Friday, August 17 they will play at The Haining House in Selkirk from 8pm.\nTickets\n, priced at \u0026pound12.50, are available

Sheriff Court on Monday to try to suspend the action.\nIt follows the latest of several demonstrations outside the Home Office building in Brand Street on Saturday, where around 100 people gathered for a peaceful protest backed by charity Positive Action in Housing, the Church of Scotland and Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees.\nRobina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, described

announced it will extend\u0026nbspthe notice period by 21 days for six people currently subject to lock-change notices, allowing them time to prepare their representations or move out of their

said of the legal challenge:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis should mean that all parties will get clarity as to how the law will apply to people who refuse to move on from the free accommodation provided to them whilst their claims for asylum are being adjudicated.\n\u0026ldquoWe have strong legal advice that our approach is fully within the law, but we think it would be helpful for all interested

He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"16k-raised-in-memory-of-much-missed-walter","story":"  Walter Fairnie\u0026rsquos wife Janet has, along with family, friends and work colleagues, helped raise the money for charity following the sudden loss of her husband in December 2016.  And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-shop-opens-at-historic-tolbooth-in-musselburgh","story":"  Mr Martin, who lives in Musselburgh and played Eric in the show, was invited to officially open The Coffee Gallery in the historic Tolbooth at the Old Town Hall, leased from East Lothian Council.

He believes the 45ft vessel was struck by a submarine or whale after it was lifted out of the water by an impact.  It suffered additional damage after striking rocks as it beached at the town.  He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It follows the latest of several demonstrations outside the Home Office building in Brand Street on Saturday, where around 100 people gathered for a peaceful protest backed by charity Positive Action in Housing, the Church of Scotland and Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees.  Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, described the evictions as \u0026ldquoimmoral, irresponsible and frankly dangerous.  Serco said it welcomed the clarity that anticipated legal challenge would bring.  In the meantime, the Home Office contractor announced it will extend\u0026nbspthe notice period by 21 days for six people currently subject to lock-change notices, allowing them time to prepare their representations or move out of their properties.  All further lock-change notices to other asylum seekers whose applications have been refused will be paused \u0026ldquowhilst the law is being tested and clarified.  A Serco statement said of the legal challenge:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis should mean that all parties will get clarity as to how the law will apply to people who refuse to move on from the free accommodation provided to them whilst their claims for asylum are being adjudicated.  \u0026ldquoWe have strong legal advice that our approach is fully within the law, but we think it would be helpful for all interested parties to have the Courts confirm the position.  Serco, which provides accommodation and welfare for around 5,000 asylum seekers in Scotland, almost all of them in Glasgow, said it had been subjected to \u0026ldquopretty vile abuse over recent days.  The company said that in Scotland, until now, it had\u0026nbspchosen not to evict failed asylum seekers when their Home Office funding stopped, continuing to provide free accommodation for months and sometimes years.  But the number of people over-staying has almost doubled in a year \u0026ndash from 167 in August 2017 to around 330 currently, it said, and \u0026ldquoat this level, we simply cannot afford to continue.  And with around 180 new asylum seekers arriving in Glasgow every month, the\u0026nbspsupply of suitable housing is \u0026ldquodesperately tight, Serco said.  It added: \u0026ldquoWe commit that we will work energetically with Glasgow City Council, the Scottish Government, charities and the Home Office to ease the path of people as they move on at the end of their adjudication process.  Graeme Brown, director of housing charity Shelter Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoOur legal team will be presenting papers to Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday morning along with the legal services agency who act for a third individual to try and get interim orders that will prevent the lock changes threatened to our clients.  \u0026ldquoOur clients are actively working with immigration lawyers to resolve their asylum claims. Interim orders temporarily stopping the lock changes will allow this work to continue with our clients having a home to live in.  Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken has made repeated calls to Home Secretary Sajid Javid to step in and halt the evictions.  The council is also examining whether it can extend its general power of welfare to help those who face having their locks changed, many of whom are young, single men."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7757605.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-2018-european-championships-springs-to-life-with-festival-of-sport","story":"  The inaugural day of sport saw qualifying rounds take place in track cycling at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, women\u0026rsquos artistic gymnastics at the SSE Hydro and rowing at Strathclyde Country Park.

The first medals of the Glasgow 2018 European Championships will be presented to athletes from the sport of synchronised swimming, with competition getting underway at Scotstoun Sports Campus today.  A temporary swimming pool filled with 330,000 gallons of water has been constructed over the tennis courts for the nine synchronised swimming events over five days of competition.  Up to 750 spectators can watch the action unfold.  Top prospects for the British team are City of Bristol Synchronised Swimming Club\u0026rsquos Kate Shortman, 16, and Isabelle Thorpe, 17, who will compete in the Olympic discipline, the Duet Technical  Their mothers, Maria Shortman and Georgie Thorpe, also competed together for Great Britain in the 1980s.

Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager costs were \u0026pound3,488 in 2015 and \u0026pound2,400 in 2017, however his official candidate return did not mention the SUAT partly bankrolled the posts.  The SUAT, which has given the Tories \u0026pound319,000 since 2001 but does not publish accounts, is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission over its status as a donor.  It was only last month, after the SNP challenged Theresa May over the SUAT at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, that the shadowy outfit first named its trustees.  The SNP last demanded full transparency from the Scottish Secretary on the issue.  The money trail from the SUAT to Mr Mundell emerged yesterday when the Electoral Commission published the accounts of hundreds of small party branches across the UK.  These included the Scottish Borders Conservative \u0026amp Unionist Association (SBCUA), which covers the Tweeddale part of Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale \u0026amp Tweeddale seat.  The accounts for 2017 said the SBCUA had a paid campaign manager overseeing a series of elections, including Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos general election fight.  \u0026ldquoThe Association is very grateful to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust for providing 50% of the funds for this crucial campaigning position throughout 2017, with the Association itself being responsible for the balance, it said.  However there is no public record of the SUAT donating directly to the SBCUA in 2017.  Other SBCUA accounts showed the SUAT also part-funded a campaign manager for Mr Mundell in 2014 and 2015 in the long build-up to the 2015 election.  The cost split was not given, but official election invoices listed the campaign manager costs as \u0026ldquo103 days @ 50% and \u0026ldquo38 days @ 50%.  The SUAT gave the SBCUA at least \u0026pound12,336 in 2014 and \u0026pound6,168 in 2015.  The SUAT and SBCUA also jointly funded a campaign manager for Tory MP John Lamont in Berwickshire, Roxburgh \u0026amp Selkirk in 2015 and 2017.  During the 2015 election, the chair and treasurer of the SBCUA was former Merrill Lynch consultant Robert Miller-Bakewell, the chair of the SUAT.  He was also deputy chair and deputy treasurer of the SBCUA at the 2017 election.  Mr Mundell has denied getting cash from the SUAT, but has not denied campaign help.  However he was cagey about the issue when quizzed on BBC Radio Scotland last month.  He said: \u0026ldquoI personally have not received cash because we go through a process of funding associations and I am confident that over the full period during which I have been involved in politics, all donations I have received from any source have been appropriately declared.  Asked him much money his campaign had received, he said: \u0026ldquoThat is a question that can be sourced from all the declarations.  SNP MSP George Adam said: \u0026ldquoThe Tory dark money scandal is a running embarrassment for the party, and they\u0027re doing themselves no favours in trying to hide from scrutiny.  \"David Mundell has repeatedly tried to deny his links to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust. Now it seems they helped bankroll his election campaign.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re talking about one of the most senior Tories in Scotland here. He should be open and honest over where this money came from.  \u0026ldquoTransparency over party finances is absolutely essential in any healthy democracy. The public have the right to know who helped put their politicians into office.\"  The Electoral Commission yesterday said it would not be investigating a \u0026lsquodark money\u0026rsquo row involving the DUP, a former Scottish Tory, and the EU referendum.  A BBC Northern Ireland TV programme alleged the DUP may have worked improperly alongside other pro-Brexit campaigners.  The DUP accepted \u0026pound435,000 from the Constitutional Research Council, chaired by former Scots Tory candidate Richard Cook, on the eve of the referendum, which was then spent on newspaper ads in the UK.  The Commission said it did not have grounds to open an investigation into the allegations.  However it also urged the UK government to bring forward legislation allowing it to disclose details of past donations to Northern Ireland parties, which are currently kept secret.  Mr Mundell is currently on a UK Government trip to New Zealand.  The Scottish Conservatives said all SUAT donations to the party and all election spending had been properly and fully reported to the Electoral Commission in line with the law.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe money donated from the SUAT comes from the proceeds of the sale of Scottish Conservative properties in Scotland in the 1960s.  \u0026ldquoSince then, the SUAT has used those funds to promote the interests of the party.  \"These publicly registered documents show that the SUAT has helped fund a campaign manager for the SBCUA in recent years, as it has supported other Associations across Scotland. In 2017, this amounted to 50 per cent of the cost of the campaign manager.\""},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-army-on-the-streets-dreams-of-better-times-on-hold-in-zimbabwe","story":"  The young mother had brought her six-month old daughter Keisha to a maternity clinic in the heart of Mbare, the biggest and oldest township in the Zimbabwean capital Harare.  With its rundown, high-density housing and bustling informal street markets and vendors, Mbare stands in part as testimony to the slump in Zimbabawe\u0026rsquos formal economy under the near 40-year autocratic rule of former President Robert Mugabe.  Mbare is a tough place to live, with unemployment and poverty rife.  Zimbabweans, ever the eternal optimists, joke that in Mbare you can buy anything, including the parts they stole from your car the night before.  Joy Mviro though was convinced that hope for the future had finally arrived. Along with most Zimbabweans she welcomed the new mood that had followed the ousting of Mr Mugabe.  \u0026ldquoWe can now talk openly, she told me. \u0026ldquoBefore Mr Mugabe was kicked out, I would have thought twice about talking to a journalist but not now, the twenty-one year old explained.  Almost every Zimbabwean I met during my visit a few months ago shared the young mother\u0026rsquos eager anticipation over the forthcoming elections. They were convinced that the ballot would bring change for the better to this long-suffering African nation.  This week Zimbabweans finally had their long awaited election, but it was one marred by the deaths of six people in an army crackdown on opposition protests.  \u0026ldquoThe government still has a military core and a military ethos, was how Zimbabwe expert Stephen Chan, of London University\u0026rsquos School of Oriental and African Studies, summed up the situation.  \u0026ldquoHow can you be so goddamn clumsy? You\u0026rsquove gone to all this trouble to stage-manage this stuff and you\u0026rsquove just gone and shot yourself in the foot, Mr Chan wryly observed.  He has a point, not least given that what again has become clear in the election\u0026rsquos aftermath, is the continuing extent of the deep rifts in Zimbabwean society and the instinctive heavy-handedness of the country\u0026rsquos security forces.  Ultimately after two days of bitter claims and counterclaims, incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old former spy chief, nicknamed \u0026lsquothe crocodile,\u0026rsquo secured a comfortable victory for his Zanu-PF party, polling 2.46 million votes against 2.15 million for 40-year-old opposition leader Nelson Chamisa of the MDC Alliance.  Time and again in the run up to the elections, I listened to government officials repeat the political mantra that Zimbabwe was now \u0026ldquoopen for business.  The bad old days of authoritarian rule they insisted were now behind the country.  Yesterday on the streets of Harare however it was police officers in vehicles with mounted loudspeakers that toured the city\u0026rsquos streets reassuring shopkeepers.  \u0026ldquoZimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not, the officers insisted.  Some election observers say that the army\u0026rsquos deployment on Harare\u0026rsquos streets and the repression used has shot a hole in the government\u0026rsquos claims that Zimbabwe has thrown off its authoritarian past.  Mr Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos government is nothing more than a military junta in disguise some claim, pointing to Constantino Chiwenga, leader of last November\u0026rsquos coup that ended Mr Mugabe\u0026rsquos rule as the man really in charge.  \u0026ldquoThis has blown the slogan \u0026lsquoOpen for Business\u0026rsquo into smoke, Ibbo Mandaza, a political analyst and a former member of the ruling Zanu-PF, told the Financial Times this week.  \u0026ldquoThe consensus now is that engagement with the west is a very far-off prospect, he said, citing discussions with foreign observers and diplomats shocked at the violent turn the elections had taken.  If this proves to be true then President Mnangagwa and his Zanu-PF party for the moment have little to celebrate. Indeed even before this week\u0026rsquos poll there have been rumours of splits and factionalism in the government\u0026rsquos ranks ever since a bomb went off during the election campaign in an apparent attempt to assassinate Mr Mnangagwa.  As for opposition leader Mr Chamisa, his premature claims of victory and inflammatory talk before the election results were fully collated, only served to fuel more uncertainty and fears over a lack of transparency in the ballot.  Zimbabwe\u0027s constitution does allow for a legal challenge to the results, but Mr Chamisa now has the huge task of proving in court with hard evidence what until now have only been claims and accusations.  Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos internal problems aside, the whole notion of the country being \u0026ldquoopen for business has been given a major setback by the way the elections were conducted and will only suffer more if unrest rears its head again.  Earlier this year in Harare, the European Union\u0026rsquos Commissioner for International Development, Neven Mimica, signed an agreement with Zimbabwean officials that saw new EU-funded programmes worth \u0026pound20 million launched to improve people\u0026rsquos access to health services and enhance their livelihoods.  I asked Mr Mimica at the time whether such future funding might be reconsidered should Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos election fail to be free and transparent and any future administration not live up to the democratic terms laid down as conditions.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has always been a reliable partner of the Zimbabwean people, and it stands ready to accompany Zimbabwe in its process of change, said Mr Mimica  \u0026ldquoWe do not want to be a passive partner in this process, he added, stressing that the EU and others were watching Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos forthcoming elections carefully and that reforms must be made and checks carried out that such a process is underway for EU financial support to be maintained. His words have now taken on a new resonance.  This was an election on which much was riding. It was supposed to confirm the legitimacy of the post-Mugabe government and allow Harare to renew ties with the international community.  Whether now the unlocking of donor funding and investment will continue as envisaged before the poll remains to be seen, but the international community is almost certain to be wary."},{"url":null,"title":"kirsty-strickland-its-no-wonder-faith-in-the-bbc-is-plummeting","story":"  Alongside that, there came the news that Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme has lost 839,000 listeners in a year. The BBC said the steep decline could be attributed to a \"quieter news agenda\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo in the second quarter of this year.  However, some view this mass switch-off as a symptom of growing frustration with the BBC\u0026rsquos editorial approach. There is palpable anger from those who believe there has become an over-representation of those from the fringes of politics. Where does a desire for balance begin and reckless promotion of political beliefs rooted in prejudice end?  The main beneficiaries seem to be those individuals who gather under the umbrella of what we now call \u0026ldquothe far-right. The term itself has been rendered almost meaningless a catch-all to describe a broad \u0026ndash and increasingly extreme \u0026ndash assortment of people and views.  As an avid consumer of the BBC\u0026rsquos news products across all its platforms it\u0026rsquos difficult to escape the creeping feeling of dismay that far-right politics and talking points are show-cased by the broadcaster. Its argument is that such views are challenged on air when they are discussed.  It\u0026rsquos impossible to imagine that Nigel Farage would have succeeded in becoming one of the most recognisable figures in politics had he not been given much more air-time than his leader-of-a-minor-party status deserved.  Of course, far-right extremists are not created on a diet of Radio 4 and BBC Breakfast: their hateful ideology is cultivated through the dark recesses of the internet and among those who are most susceptible to it.  When this rhetoric seeps into public discourse the BBC should pause and ask itself hard questions about inflating its reach and influence \u0026ndash and whether or not it thinks it has a duty to resist some of this. The BBC is more, much more, than a news organisation. It holds a unique position in our public and thus has a responsibility \u0026ndash and an opportunity \u0026ndash to lead the wider media in shaping an effective response to new challenges.  Much of the criticism of the BBC has developed over time, as an unintentional consequence of the BBC\u0026rsquos ethos and purpose: to provide balanced, impartial broadcasting. Of itself \u0026lsquobalance\u0026rsquo is a noble and worthwhile aim. The BBC\u0026rsquos fixation with conveying the opinions of \u0026ldquoboth sides though, has led us to a troubling place.  The goal is neutrality and impartiality: the unfortunate result is a skewed perspective in debates and discussion. When the opinions of experts are given equal weight to those with strongly held, though misinformed, views, the public is ill-served. During turbulent political times, both at home and abroad, it\u0026rsquos important that we separate commentary from reporting the experts from the charlatans.  For many, a tipping-point in their frustration has been reached, due partly to the alarming decline of truth in Donald Trump\u0026rsquos America. Demagogues don\u0026rsquot even need to be accomplished orators \u0026ndash so long as they say \u0026ldquofake news! often enough they are able to reduce provable fact to mere debating points.  The UK shouldn\u0026rsquot delude itself into thinking it is immune from such a bombastic approach to politics. We\u0026rsquove already seen promises that were made during the EU referendum campaign proven to be lies. Government ministers seem more intent on serving their own ends when it comes to Brexit than being honest with the public about what lies ahead.  It\u0026rsquos ironic that during the referendum campaign we were told the public were apparently sick of experts. Now many wish that a grown-up would come along and cut through all the noise and misdirection.  The BBC should value truth beyond making sure everybody has their say. It is an authority, not someone who holds the jackets. Experts from Women\u0026rsquos Aid and Rape Crisis shouldn\u0026rsquot have to mitigate the misinformation spouted by men\u0026rsquos rights activists when they are invited to speak about the statistical reality of violence against women. Neither should any other expert in their field.  Too often when the BBC is criticised there\u0026rsquos an (understandable) reaction from its journalists who think that their integrity is being questioned. It\u0026rsquos a sad truth that some are often abused, particularly on social media. The majority who raise concerns about the editorial decisions of the BBC, though, are doing so because they want to see it thrive and modernise.  I don\u0026rsquot believe that a memo circulated around BBC staff directing them to talk up Nigel Farage or to give a platform to racists or their ideology: but the cumulative effect of the drip, drip, drip and normalisation of certain extreme positions is eroding trust and confidence.  The BBC cannot please everybody. For each individual complaining their coverage is weighted in favour of the right another will lament perceived left-wing bias. Leavers and remainers Yes and No left and right: the polarisation of politics makes it impossible always to get it right.  The solution lies in recognising the real danger of faith in our national broadcaster diminishing to a point where it becomes unrecoverable. This cannot be allowed to happen. More than ever, we desperately need impartial, responsible journalism to steer us through the social and cultural challenges up ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"i-had-more-or-less-given-up-blind-man-recounts-clifftops-ordeal-on-iona","story":"  Laying at the foot of a 30ft cliff edge, the then 48-year-old strained every muscle to haul his crumpled body up to higher sands in a bid to avoid drowning in the incoming tide.  \"I didn\u0027t feel the physical pain at first.

It was raining continuously.  \"At that point I was resigned to the fact that I was on my own, and had more or less given up.\"  It was after five hours, and after crawling what he thinks was around 70 metres, he was spied by an American tourist, who at first thought he was a crumpled up backpack. He was then airlifted to hospital  Had he remained were he originally fell, he said he wouldn\u0027t have been seen.  \"I was with my friend on Iona. She would obviously be concerned about me, it was getting dark.  \"I wasn\u0027t really thinking about my own preservation. Getting back to my friend was the only thing on my mind,\" he added.

Now he has made a full recovery from the fall, which took place in 2014, a week after the independence referendum. \"  \"It was certainly an interesting time,\" he said.  \"When I talk about it, it doesn\u0027t seem like it was me. It seems like someone else.

It comes amid ongoing concerns that Scotland is lagging behind England when it comes to actual superfast broadband speeds.  Just over a week ago Westminster\u0026rsquos Scottish Affairs committee called on the UK and Scottish Governments to work together following political squabbling over the roll-out of broadband north of the Border.    For the last three months, home broadband providers have had to ensure that at least 50% of their customers can achieve advertised speeds at peak time.  The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) began to enforce the tougher standard \u0026ndash that speed claims should available to at least half of customers between 8pm and 10pm and described in ads as \u0026ldquoaverage \u0026ndash from May.  Acccording to Which? BT, EE, John Lewis Broadband, Plusnet, Sky, Zen Internet, Post Office, SSE, TalkTalk and Utility Warehouse previously advertised their standard (ADSL) broadband deals as \u0026lsquoup to 17Mbps\u0026rsquo. The new advertised speed is now more than a third lower at 10Mbps or 11Mbps.    Previously, suppliers were able to advertise broadband deals which claimed \u0026lsquoup-to\u0026rsquo speeds that only one in 10 customers would ever reach.  But the new advertising rules mean that at least half of customers must now be able to get an advertised average speed, even during peak times (8-10pm).  Which? found that across all the deals on offer from the 12 biggest providers, the advertised speeds from \u0026lsquoup to 17Mbps\u0026rsquo to \u0026lsquoup to 100 Mbps\u0026rsquo had dropped by an average of 15%.  TalkTalk has completely dropped advertising speed claims from most of its deals. Vodafone has also changed the name of some of its deals: Fibre 38 and Fibre 76 are now Superfast 1 and Superfast 2.    Only advertised speeds by Virgin Media, which is the only provider that can give gold standard fibre-to-the-router superfast broadband, have gone up since the change.  Before the new rules came into effect, Which? found evidence that British households were paying for broadband services that were on average 51% slower than advertised.  Which? has called for guidelines over advertised speeds since 2013 through its Broadband Speed Guaranteed campaign.  Alex Neill of Which? said: \u0026ldquoCustomers will now have a much clearer idea of the speeds that can be achieved when they are shopping around for broadband.  \u0026ldquoFor those still struggling to get a reasonable speed or connection, the Government must press ahead with its crucial plans to deliver the service that broadband customers need, without it costing them the earth.  CAP toughened up the standards following research which found they were likely to mislead consumers.  The study, commissioned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), found most consumers thought they were likely to receive a speed at or close to a provider\u0026rsquos headline claim when, for many, that was not the case.  Previous independent testing by consumer groups found that up to three quarters of households were paying for advertised broadband speeds they never received."},{"url":null,"title":"want-to-pass-a-driving-test-try-golspie-says-survey","story":"  Data from the DVSA found that 57.4% of learners in Scotland passed their practical test in 2017/18 \u0026ndash the highest pass rate anywhere in the UK.

The US car manufacturer revealed its plans to take some of the strain out of pulling loads of shopping around in a recent patent application.  Its designs look similar to the traditional two-wheeled trolley bags that have long been towed around by grannies on their trip to the Post Office.  But rather than needing to be tugged behind the user, Ford\u0026rsquos trolley features two different modes.  According to the patent, the handle of the trolley is packed with sensors that detect when it is being pulled, controlling the wheels so that it moves along at the same pace as its owner.  Each of the wheels is powered independently to make cornering easier and on downhill slopes it can apply a braking force to prevent the person using it being knocked over by heavy loads.  \u0026ldquoThe shopping trolley has an inclination sensor for detecting the inclination of the travel surface, Ford states in the patent. It also describes how the trolley can deal with steps or kerbs.  Sensors or cameras on the front of the trolley allow it to detect steps and then apply more power to the wheels to make it easier to mount these obstacles.  But while the trolley can be pulled along by the shopper, Ford also wants it to be able to move by itself, following the shopper at an acceptable distance.  Rod Dennis, a spokesman for the RAC, said: \u0026ldquoWhile it might be the promise of autonomous cars that tends to grab the headlines, it\u0026rsquos much more likely that we\u0026rsquoll see smaller-scale smart technology like this."},{"url":null,"title":"rules-force-more-accurate-broadband-speed-adverts","story":"  a consumer group has found.

Her visit to the Fort de Bregancon followed fresh warnings about the economic impact of the failure to reach a deal on the UK\u0026rsquos departure from the European Union.  Earlier, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned the chances of a no-deal brexit were \u0026ldquouncomfortably high and said crashing out the EU would be \u0026ldquohighly undesirable.  He said the prospect of the UK leaving Europe without any kind of deal on future trade and customs arrangements was \u0026ldquoa relatively unlikely, but it is a possibility.  The UK and Europe should do all things to avoid a no-deal scenario, he said.  It would mean \u0026ldquodisruption to trade as we know it and therefore a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time, he said.  He saide: \u0026ldquoI think the possibility of a no-deal is uncomfortably high at this point. It is highly undesirable. Parties should do all things to avoid it.  However, he said the UK\u0026rsquos banks had been stress-tested to ensure they could withstand the shock of a no-deal if it did happen.  His remarks led to the pound falling sharply to just under $1.30. He was speaking the day after the Bank\u0026rsquos Monetary Policy Committee raised interest rates to their highest level in nine years, from a base rate of 0.5 to 0.75 per cent.  Mr Carney denied the move was designed to build some slack into the system in anticipation of Brexit, in case rates needed to be lowered again as an emergency measure.  Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group of MPs, dismissed Mr Carney\u0026rsquos comments.  He said: \u0026ldquoMark Carney has long been the high priest of project fear whose reputation for inaccurate and politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England.  Mrs May cut short her break in the Italian Lakes a day early to attend the hastily-arranged talks with Mr Macron.

Although people have long wondered how and why the famous monument was built, the question of \u0026ldquowho built it has received much less attention.  Now, a study sheds some light on these prehistoric people and where they came from. Using new technology that can determine where dead people lived, scientists say cremated human remains from the site show some of the people there came from other parts of western Britain, most likely Wales.  Those people also probably lugged some of the Welsh stones that were used to construct Stonehenge, according to the study, published in the  journal Scientific Reports.  Stonehenge, one of the most impressive prehistoric megalithic monuments on Earth, is a World Heritage site known for its alignment with the movements of the Sun.  Thousands of people travel there each year to mark the solstices in summer and winter.  However, \u0026ldquodespite over a century of intense study of Stonehenge, we still know very little about the individuals buried at the site, the study said.  To rectify this, researchers analysed skull bones from 25 individuals buried at the monument to better understand the lives of the people there.  \u0026ldquoWhile 15 of the people were local to the Stonehenge region, the other 10 probably spent at least the last few years of their lives in present-day Wales, study authors say.  The cremated remains suggest that people not only supplied the stones used to build the stone circle, but also \u0026ldquomoved with the stones and were buried there too, the study said.  Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported. Sea and land routes are both possible.  Study lead author Rick Schulting, of Oxford University, said \u0026ldquothe really remarkable thing about our study is the ability of new developments in science to extract so much new information from such small and unpromising fragments of bone."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-call-for-watchdog-to-check-david-mundell-dark-money-funding","story":"  The SNP said the Scottish Secretary should explain why he didn\u0026rsquot declare thousands of pounds of support from the controversial Scottish Unionist Association Trust (SUAT) in his parliamentary register of interests.  The Herald revealed yesterday that the SUAT, which is being investigated by the Electoral Commission over its status as a political donor, helped bankroll a campaign manager for Mr Mundell at the last two general elections.  Mr Mundell reported his campaign manager costs as \u0026pound3488 in 2015 and \u0026pound2400 in 2017.  The Tories said Mr Mundell didn\u0026rsquot need to register the money at the Commons as the SUAT gave it to his local party, not to him, to fund a campaign manager.  However the Commons Code of Conduct says MPs must register donations over \u0026pound1500 given to a local party and there is \u0026ldquoa clear link between the donation and [the MP] for example, if it was given... with a wish that it be allocated... to his or her fighting fund.  Mr Mundell, the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale \u0026amp Tweeddale, has never declared any financial support from the SUAT in his register of interests.  Nor did he refer to the SUAT\u0026rsquos financial support in his office candidate return in 2015.  The salary for Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager in 2017 was split 50-50 by the SUAT and Scottish Borders Conservative \u0026amp Unionist Association.  The cost in 2015 was split between the SUAT and Tory HQ in London, although the Borders Association accounts do not say if this was also a 50-50 split.  However invoices from Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign refer to 141 days \u0026ldquo@ 50%, suggesting it was an equal split.  If half the bill in 2015 was indeed met by the SUAT, this would be \u0026pound1744, above the \u0026pound1500 threshold for declarations in the register of interests.  The SUAT, which has given the Tories \u0026pound319,000 since 2001, does not publish accounts or detail the source of its income, leading to SNP claims it is a source of so-called \u0026lsquodark money\u0026rsquo, or untraceable political funding.  It was only after SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked Theresa May about the SUAT in the Commons last month that it finally published a list of its trustees.  The SUAT chair is Robert Miller-Bakewell, who was Borders Association chair and treasurer in 2014 and 2015, when the SUAT began funding Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager.  SNP MSP George Adam said: \u0026ldquoThe dark money scandal goes from bad to worse.  \u0026ldquoThere are questions over whether David Mundell failed to properly declare the benefit he received. Was he trying to hide something? In the interests of complete transparency it\u0026rsquos high time Mr Mundell was open and honest about the source of these funds.  \u0026ldquoThe Secretary of State should refer himself to the Commissioner for Standards to investigate whether he breached strict parliamentary rules over declaring political donations.  Mr Miller-Bakewell did not respond to requests for comment.  A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \u0026ldquoThere is no requirement to place this funding on the MPs Register of Interests. This funding was not given to Mr Mundell or to his fighting fund. It was given to the local association to help fund regional campaign managers over recent years.  \"In compliance with the rules, it was therefore registered as a donation with the Electoral Commission. \"Mr Mundell properly declared the value of the campaign manager in his election returns in 2015 and 2017.  \"As an MP of 13 years standing, Mr Mundell has a track record of complete transparency and every donation he has received in compliance with both the spirit and letter of the rules.\"?"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers-clarify-booze-crackdown-amid-confusion","story":"  Wholesalers who sell to both the public and trade will now have to operate a dual-pricing system, applying MUP to sales to the public but not to trade sales.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities. The new station, which accompanies Network Rail’s Aberdeen to Inverness Improvement Project, is due to re-open to passenger services in late 2019.

People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services. They will need some convincing therefore that their interests lie at the heart of these proposals.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This puts the institution two per cent above the Scottish average.UHI has also performed above the Scottish sector in almost all measures and this high level of student satisfaction can be found across all areas of the partnership.Dr Iain Morrison, dean of students, said: “This wonderful result has been achieved through cohesive, coordinated and collective efforts by many people across the partnership.

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Saturday 4 Aug 2018 8:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Saturday 4 Aug 2018 8:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Saturday 4 Aug 2018 8:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The jet-powered boat successfully floated in a loch on the Isle of Bute in Scotland on Saturday, in an operation watched by his daughter Gina.            Campbell died aged 45 on Coniston Water in January 1967 when the boat, travelling at more than 300mph, flipped into the air and disintegrated as he attempted to beat his own record.            Scenes were tense as the team struggled to get the Bluebird K7 into the water at Loch Fad, but the renovated craft was afloat before 4pm.Campbell’s body, with his race suit still intact, was pulled from the Cumbria lake along with the wreckage from the depths in 2001.Volunteers have worked to restore the boat to near its original state, but they said the engine had to be replaced.The team hopes to make full displays in a fully-completed vessel a year later following Saturday’s test.Having broken eight world speed records on water and land in the 1950s and 1960s, Campbell was attempting to break his own water speed record of 276mph when he was killed.

Eastern Western – one of the country’s biggest players – has purchased the entire share capital of Barnetts Motor Group, which represents Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo from a large single site in Dundee and also Volkswagen in St Andrews.            No financial details have been disclosed for what is likely to have been a fairly substantial multi-million-pound deal.            The Barnetts business generated sales of £65.3 million last year and returned a £1.3m pre-tax profit.The Volvo franchise will be transferred to the John Clark Motor Group, as revealed earlier this week, and in turn Eastern Western Motor Group acquires the Nissan businesses in Dundee and Perth. Nissan in Dundee will be rehoused in the showroom vacated by Volvo.Douglas Brown, group managing director of Eastern Holdings, Eastern Western Motor Group’s parent company, said: “We have known Paul Barnett for many years and as a result it has been a quick, professional and seamless transaction.“Barnetts Motor Group and the Nissan franchises in Dundee and Perth will be a great addition to the Eastern Western Motor Group. It will give further depth and scale to our existing business and increase our points of representation of these franchises to five Nissan, four Volkswagen and two Mazda.“Similar to our recent acquisitions of Grassicks BMW and Mini in Perth and Phoenix Honda in Stirling, this further cements our relationship with three of our key partners and is in line with our strategy of growing and developing the group with existing brand partners in new geographical territories.            “We look forward to welcoming Barnetts’ teams and our new Nissan teams to the group and we will continue to trade under the Barnetts name in Dundee and St Andrews as it is synonymous with quality and excellent customer service. Nissan in Perth will trade as Western Nissan.”Barnetts Motor Group was formed when its first Volvo dealership was opened in Seagate in the early 1960s. The company has grown steadily and now employs 150 people throughout Tayside and Fife selling more than 4,000 vehicles every year and carrying out in excess of 25,000 services annually.It is understood that Paul Barnett will turn his focus to further developing the family’s property interests through Barnetts Properties.Eastern Western represents 12 franchises – Mercedes-Benz cars, Smart, Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles, BMW, Mini, Lexus, Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda and Harley-Davidson."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777920.1533233129!/image/image.jpg","title":"cameron wyllie hey teachers leave those cool kids alone","story":"        Teachers should be relaxed about some pupils being \u0026#8216cool\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 it\u0026#8217s a quality like being good-looking or charming, if not actually one of the big virtues, such as honesty, loyalty and kindness, writes former headteacher Cameron Wyllie.                Five years ago, I was on an October Week trip to New York City organised by the art-and-design department of the school where I was a senior manager.            The party consisted of me, two lovely pals of mine who taught art and design, and 25 students from the senior years.             We did a little bit of NYC tourist stuff and toured the politan Museum, The Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney. We saw a show. And, of course, we shopped. The hours for shopping were strictly regulated but we all got our fix and, let’s be honest, the typical pupil of art and design does like a nice outfit.Thus I found myself in the flagship store of Uniqlo on Fifth Avenue, while the young people threw themselves at arty T-shirts, puffer jackets and unusually patterned footwear.I, being approximately 18 times their age, contented myself browsing among the astonishingly cheap cardigans. Then I tried on a hat – a simple old-fashioned trilby in grey and burgundy. While I was considering the crumbling view in the mirror, one of the kids wandered past and said, “Good hat. You should buy that.” Now this was one of the seven boys on the trip, a young man of definite style who, like many of them, dressed with the easy detachment of fashionable youth.            So I did buy that hat (in the sale, $12) and every time I wear it, someone will say “I like your hat” or “great hat” or “Where did you get that hat?” or “You suit that hat”. It doesn’t matter what artfully contrived combination of other clothes I have on, the blooming hat gets the praise, the one thing that I didn’t really pick myself. I don’t know whether to be grateful or irritated.READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upThe truth is, some people are cool and most of us are not. A common complaint about young people in schools is that they spend way too much time trying to be cool – in the staffroom, wise old heads nod together and say of some errant child, “Aye that one’s too cool for school.”             It isn’t completely clear to anyone what ‘cool’ really means but essentially we all understand it – at a school leavers’ function some years back I used the word ‘cool’ in praise of one of the other young people there, which led to a discussion about who, exactly, was ‘cool’ in this group of people they had been with for years and years. They unanimously identified five or six people who combined some of the necessary characteristics and I could only concur with their selection. There were no hard feelings – only a few are chosen and the rest of us just have to get on with it.What teachers need to accept is that there’s nothing wrong with being cool – it’s just something that happens, like being very funny or having good hair. We need to stop railing about ‘coolness’ like we rail about smoking or idleness (it may be that some cool kids smoke and some are lazy but it’s not a necessary part of the conidition).             One school I know of went through such an ‘anti-cool campaign’ that it enlisted children to wear ‘Glad To Be Sad’ badges, which I personally felt to be going a bit far (though I imagine the badges themselves are now collectors’ items).This kind of approach towards a particular kind of teenager only encourages all teenagers to exaggerate the gulf in attitudes between themselves and their teachers heaven forfend, it may make them think that some of their teachers are a teeny bit jealous because they themselves were never cool, and never will be. READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertIncidentally, make no mistake – when a 16-year-old says “I think Mr Smith is cool”, it probably just means that Mr Smith does not impose the regulations regarding late homework, not that the young person would let Mr Smith choose their hair products.So let’s try to view ‘cool’ differently. Let’s see it as a desirable personal characteristic that some people have and let’s look at it positively. In educating young Scots about the state of the world they’re going into, let’s talk with them about all the different characteristics humanity shares, and instead of sneering at this vague but desirable state, let’s praise them all for what they give the world.  Of course, there’s a big range of personal virtues to choose from and ‘cool’, given its temporary nature, goes in the column with ‘good looks’ and ‘charm’, rather than being a big hitter like ‘honesty’, ‘loyalty’ or, biggest of all, ‘kindness’. Instead of being so negative and taking the risk of alienating pupils who, let’s face it, are usually popular with their peers, let’s accentuate the positive and gently point out what really matters in the long term whether you’re cool or not.  The American singer Courtney Marie Andrews puts it well: “And if your money runs out/And your good looks fade/May your kindness remain.” Heidies – there’s a good message for the first assembly of term!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778821.1533384777!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom harris resigns from labour party after 34 years","story":"        Former Glasgow MP and transport minister Tom Harris has quit Labour after 34 years in the midst of the anti-Semitism row engulfing the party.                 The former transport minister, has quit Labour after 34 years in the midst of the anti-Semitism row engulfing the party.             Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has called for “further discussion and dialogue” with the Jewish community as the row over anti-Semitism continues.            Mr Leonard said the party needed to win the confidence of Jewish supporters, however he stopped short of backing the adoption of the international definition of anti-Semitism in full.Several Labour MSPs have expressed their support for the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition to be accepted by Labour in its entirety, including a list of examples.Pressed on his views during an interview with BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland, Mr Leonard said: “I am willing to recommend we have further discussion and dialogue with the Jewish community, including the Jewish community in Scotland, which I intend to lead on, because we need to win the confidence of the Jewish community.“We need to get to a position where not only have we got a very robust code on anti-Semitism within the Labour Party - which we are striving to achieve - but also which allows for freedom of speech, a discourse around Palestine and Israel.”He added: “I want to make sure that the Labour Party is not only a party that the Jewish community supports, but is prepared to join and be active in.”            “There has got to be a way through this, and the way through this may be that we do, in the end, adopt in full all of the working examples in the IHRA code, but I am also determined to make sure that freedom of speech is maintained inside the Labour Party too.”Mr Leonard’s comments come as Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to build bridges with the Jewish community were rebuffed by critics.The Labour leader has insisted he will root out anti-Semites from Labour and acknowledged mistakes in the way the party had handled the crisis.But the Jewish Labour Movement said trust had broken down with the party leadership, while the Campaign Against Antisemitism lashed out at Mr Corbyn’s failure to apologise for his own conduct.            Tory MP Paul Masterton said: “Richard Leonard appears as lacklustre as Jeremy Corbyn when it comes to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour.“Many within his own party will find it hard to understand why he was unable to endorse the IHRA code under questioning this morning.“With former Glasgow MP Tom Harris resigning from the party this weekend after 34 years, Labour is once again in chaos.”Mr Harris has been a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn and told The Herald newspaper on his resignation from Labour: “It’s just not the place for me any more”.Mr Harris represented Glasgow Cathcart then Glasgow South from 2001 to 2015, and was transport minister from 2006 to 2008.

One of three options put forward by the city council is for “a radical rethink of how the city moves and operates” where “key streets could be pedestrianised”.            The document, called ‘Connecting our cities, transforming our places’, explains three approaches to potentially overhauling the future of transport in the Scottish capital.            City centre routes such as Princes and George streets on which cars, buses and taxis could be banned have not yet been specifically identified in a report that proposes what would be the greatest transport shake-up of Edinburgh’s Old and New Towns.But the report does say: “The city centre would become a largely traffic free zone, with controls in place to allow for essential traffic and with pedestrian priority in the city, town and local centres.“You would be able to go to, but not through the city centre.“A series of hubs could be developed where buses would drop off and other forms of less impactful transport would take over.“Pavements would be significantly widened and public spaces improved. Key streets would be pedestrianised.”            The report adds: “There would be strategic walking routes and segregated cycle routes across the city, with a citywide wayfinding network to guide pedestrians around the city.“Public transport could be fully integrated with smart contactless payment for use across all public transport services. New park and ride interchanges could be provided at key points around the city, with a series of new bus priority corridors linked to them.” Another ‘prospectus’ option to be put to the public includes a “business-as-usual approach”, although the Scottish Government is requiring the council to establish a Low Emission Zone (LEZ). Scotland’s first pollution-reducing LEZ is to be set up in Glasgow at the end of this year, with fines for motorists who enter the boundary in proscribed vehicles after a certain date.The third option is a “strategic approach” that highlights possible “controls on the levels of general traffic, with restrictions on through traffic within certain areas”.            The report adds: “Priority would be for people on foot and bicycles on specific streets, including George Street and the Royal Mile. Gaps in the existing walking and cycling networks would be completed.” The report points out the three options are not mutually exclusive.Subject to approval from the council’s transport and environment committee, the eight-week public engagement will start next month.City council transport convener Councillor Lesley Macinnes said: “We are very conscious that we have a city centre residential population in marked contrast to many other cities. We need to take care of their needs and expectations of where they live. It’s also about those who visit and those who come into the city centre.“Health is a key aspect of this and it’s about air quality. It’s about providing more opportunities to walk and cycle and better use of public transport.”Cllr Macinnes added: “What is really exciting about the prospectus is the vision that it represents. The status quo is not enough for this city.”            Other transport plans mooted in a bid to ease congestion could involve bus lane operating hours returning to seven days a week.The council’s transport committee will also consider installing more automatic cameras to make sure motorists keep out of bus lanes. Some bus lanes in the city only operate during peak times, but bus operators have told the council they would like the hours to be extended to speed up journey times. The public transport routes could operate from 7am to 7pm, seven days a week.Since being introduced in 2012, Edinburgh’s bus lane cameras have tallied up £4.4 million in fines."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778871.1533396570!/image/image.jpg","title":"westminister is a club masquerading as a parliament says mhairi black","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP, who has been a staunch opponent of the UK Parliament’s rules and traditions since her election in 2015, said it was a “defunct” institution.            Ms Black made the comments during an event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe which covered a wide range of topics, from her views on Brexit, to online abuse and her own experiences as a young gay woman.            She told host Graham Spiers that while she enjoyed helping her constituents, she did not enjoy the other side of the job “and the crap that comes with it”.“I think Westminster itself as an institution is founded upon all the bits of being an MP I don’t like,” she said.READ MORE: Mhairi Black to make debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe “It does not serve us, and in actual fact I would go so far as to say it’s not even a parliament - it is a club that masquerades itself.“It is designed in such a way that people are not held to account, it is designed in such a way that you can bleat and complain and vote against things, and it doesn’t make a blind bit of difference.            “It is designed in such a way that you will fall at every hurdle.READ MORE: Mhairi Black defends voting record at Westminster “It is as difficult as it possibly can be to get any change.”She continued: “As an institution it is defunct, it is not fit for purpose.”            Alongside her views on Westminster, Ms Black also voiced criticism of her fellow MPs, whom she once described in an interview as “sociopaths”.“Politics attracts quite often the worst of humanity,” she said.“It attracts people who are power hungry, who have all kinds of hidden agendas.“So, if you’ve got all of them in this institution that the public doesn’t understand, that the public assumes is too complicated for them, and they can legitimately get away with wasting hundreds of pounds under the guise of protocol and tradition, then of course they’re going to do that.”Asked about rumours she could quit Westminster, Ms Black, who was just 20 when she became the youngest MP three years ago, said she did not know whether she would stand for re-election.            Meanwhile, the Glasgow University graduate also addressed questions on her unlikely rapport with Tory MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.“In a colleague sense, I get on fine with the guy, but his views are vile,” Ms Black said.“People need to acknowledge this guy is dangerous, because for all the manners and all the niceness, he doesn’t think women should have the right to their body, he doesn’t think I should be allowed to get married because I’m gay.“That’s terrifying.” "},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 4 Aug 2018 8:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

This keeps individuals on the right side of the wildlife protection laws, and helps ensure the best possible outcome for the kittens too.\"\nSWA project areas manager, Dr Roo Campbell, said: \"We are well into kitten season now and we have already had a number of inquiries relating to possible wildcats kittens, some in Badenoch and Strathspey.\n\"What we would say is that it is virtually impossible to tell whether kittens are tabby domestic cats or wildcat kitten at a young age.\n\"We wouldn\u0027t recommend making an assessment until around six months of age.\n\"A nursing mother wildcat will temporarily leave the kittens to go hunting and could be scared off by lots of human activity around the kittens.\"\nHe explained: \"When working with wild individuals held in captivity, we have the luxury of using the combined pelage (coat markings) and genetic scoring to assess whether an individual is a wildcat.\n\"If found in the wild, we would ensure that both tests are done before confirming whether they are wildcat kittens.\n\"Unfortunately, such is the poor status of the Scottish wildcat population, any kittens found are likely to be feral-hybrid cats than of wildcats.\n\"If suspected wildcat kittens are reported to SWA and they turn out to be wildcats then when it comes to returning these individuals to the wild it is important to ensure there exists a viable population in the same area and that risks such as hybridisation and disease have been mitigated against.\n\"In this context we would highlight that a suitable release location is one where there is a programme of trap neuter vaccinate and return of feral cats such as conducted by SWA.\"\nSaturday 4 Aug 2018 8:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116892.jpg","title":"Dual stretch of A9 is back in operation","story":"\u0026nbsp\nTHE dual carriageway on the new A9 stretch between Dalraddy and Aviemore has been re-opened to motorists after roadworks.\nThe timing of the works at the start of the summer was criticised by community and business leaders.\nThere were also claims that Transport Scotland had put off installing the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) cabling last year to allow them to open the dual \u0026ndash part of the \u0026pound3 billion flagship project \u0026ndash as pledged by the end of last summer.\nSeveral laybys still remain closed along the five mile stretch.\nThe road was reduced to single lanes in each direction with 50mph speed limits in place for most of the duration of the six weeks of the work.\nTourism leaders questioned why work could not have been done outwith the peak holiday season.\nSaturday 4 Aug 2018 8:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/02748000/02748487.jpg","title":"Spate of calls sparks Highland Council landlord reminders over private water supplies","story":"Staff Reporter\nLandlords\u0026nbspwhose tenants are fed water from private supplies are being urged to remember their responsibilities amid the dry summer conditions.\nLow water levels have been experienced on many rivers and burns as a result of the exceptional weather.\nAnd Highland Council has reminded owners of private water supplies and landlords of tenants on private water supplies that it is their responsibility to arrange for the provision of water to their properties.\nIt issued the reminder after its environmental health team received calls from a number of people to warn that their supplies were drying up.\nThe council warned that it is not required to provide water in these situations but that the responsibility is that of the owner or landlord.\nIt added that its environmental health team will offer advice and possible grants to bring medium to long term improvements in the private supply, including improving the volume of the supply or storage.\u0026nbsp\nIt can also request Scottish Water to assist but full costs will be recovered from the owner or landlord.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27423  ","story":"Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nSinn Féin leaders will meet the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier later today to make it clear that the issues of Ireland and the border need to resolved before the next EU summit in October. \nParty President Mary Lou McDonald TD and deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill MLA will meet Mr Barnier in Brussels later today at the headquarters of the EU Commission. \nAt today\u0027s meeting, the pair are expected to tell the EU negotiator that the backstop already agreed between the EU and the British government must be maintained and form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. \nThat backstop would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market and would avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nThe Sinn Féin leaders will also call on Michel Barnier to ensure the issues of the border and Ireland are resolved ahead of the next planned EU summit in October. \nOne way of doing this would be to hold a special EU summit in September to deal specifically with Irish issues, they are expected to tell he chief negotiator. \nToday\u0027s meeting will be the latest in a series of meetings between Sinn Féin and Michel Barnier both in Brussels and Ireland in recent months. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27424  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald TD along with Dáil Health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly TD and Assembly spokesperson on Mental Health Órlaithí Flynn MLA in Dublin today.\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The voices of women must be heard when it comes to healthcare.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

a great way to save money.\nA spokeswoman for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council this week refuted the claims, saying: There have been no instances lately of bins not being collected other than due to local access issues and these are always followed up the next day.\u0026#160 \nStaff in the Waste team have flexible job roles and are employed where needed across cleansing, waste and recycling centres.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06.jpg","title":"65378  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship has taken place.\nEleven international teams are making Antrim their home for this week\u0027s event. \nTwo hundred young people from USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain,\u0026#160 Republic of Ireland,\u0026#160 France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nSpectators will have a great view from the Lough Shore of the 11 picturesque gigs as they race on Lough Neagh.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a03.jpg","title":"65381  ","story":"    \nA SECTARIAN killer has appeared at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court charged with escaping lawful custody.\nStanding handcuffed in the dock, 32-year-old Christopher Kerr spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.\nIn addition to an offence of escaping lawful custody, Kerr is also accused of three drugs offences.\nThe alleged offences arose after he allegedly ran away from prison officers in Victoria Square shopping centre while out on day release.\nKerr, who is currently serving a life term for the shocking and horrifying sectarian attack which claimed the life of 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen, was arrested at Antrim Area Hospital the following day. \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f2.jpg","title":"65382  ","story":"    \nA CRUMLIN family has again been hit by tragedy after the sudden death of a teenager, just weeks after his father passed away.\nHenry Turley (14)\u0026#160 fell from a hotel balcony in the beach resort of Playa de Muro on Majorca in the early hours of last Wednesday (July 18).\nSpanish Civil Guard said his mother Claire was holding on to his hand and attempting to save him after he overbalanced on the second floor balcony before he fell at around midnight.\nHenry\u0027s death comes less than seven weeks after his father Stephen, who ran the Ten Storey tattoo parlour in Crumlin, was discovered dead at a friend\u0027s house.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f-jpg.jpg","title":"65469  ","story":"    \nWITH last weekend\u0027s downpour bringing Antrim to a standstill, it was no surprise that rain also stopped played at Muckamore Cricket Club!\nAfter weeks of fine weather, normal service was finally resumed with one of the most dramatic downpours in living memory.\nMuckamore Firsts were taking on North Down at the time, but the players soon beat a hasty retreat to the clubhouse when the skies opened.

Everything will be included in the exhibition at the end of the project.”\n\nThe Caravan Gallery has recently spoken at The Martin Parr Foundation on its approach to engaging communities and has

paisley by election petition to be set up in three north antrim towns","story":"\nThe petition to remove Ian Paisley as North Antrim MP and force a by-election will be available for signing at three locations in the constituency, it has been confirmed.\n\n                \nIn a public notice in today’s News Letter, the Electoral Office reveals that the petition will be available to sign in north Antrim’s three main towns – Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nIan Paisley has vowed to stand again for election if he is forced into a by-election\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMembers of the public who want to force a by-election – in which Mr Paisley has made clear he will stand for re-election – will be able to sign from 9am next Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition will be open to sign until 5pm each week day at the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney, the Seven Towers Leisure Centre in Ballymena and the Sheskburn House Recreation Centre in Ballycastle.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe petition will remain open to sign for six weeks, until 19 September.\n\nThere will also be evening signings – something required by the legislation governing recall petitions – on September 6 and 13, when the petition can be signed up until 9pm.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea – who is responsible for the process – had discretion under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to designate up to 10 locations within the constituency for the petition to be signed.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP has clarified that Ian Paisley has not left the party after some confusion yesterday in the wake of Parliament redesignating the North Antrim MP as an independent.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe party confirmed that Mr Paisley remained suspended, rather than having been expelled, and as part of that the party had withdrawn the whip from him.\n\nThat puts him in the same category as MPs such as Ivan Lewis, who is suspended by Labour and is listed as an independent.\n\nThe recall process was automatically triggered when Mr Paisley was given a suspension of 30 sitting days – the longest on record since at least 1949 – over “serious misconduct” relating to taking free luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then lobbying on behalf of the regime without declaring that they had given the valuable gifts to himself and his family.\n\nThe DUP veteran apologised for not declaring the holidays but insisted to Parliament’s standards commissioner that his letter asking the prime minister to change UK policy at the UN to that favoured by Sri Lanka did not amount to lobbying for the regime.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition to remove Mr Paisley will have to be signed by 7,547 people – 10% of the eligible North Antrim electorate – if there is to be a by-election.\n\nUnlike the situation with an election, any voter – not just those who can provide a legitimate reason for not being able to vote in person – will be able to apply to sign the petition by post.\n\nThat rule, about which DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has expressed concern, is in place because, unlike an election, it will be known that anyone going into the signing place will be there to sign the petition, reducing the typical anonymity around an election.\n\nParties wanting to campaign for people to sign the petition will have to register if they are planning to spend more than £500.\n\n

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix.

I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"actor jamie dornan captured on canvas","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Irrespective of how strong an argument or position, maybe it is always wrong to assume that circumstances cannot or will not change. My view remains that the Union will survive. But it will not survive because Robinson, Sammy Wilson and I say so.\n\nIt will only survive if unionism, collectively and individually, makes a strong case, sells the message, expands the support base and prepares for all eventualities. That is all Robinson is saying.\n\nWhen I suggested in an article a couple of weeks before the 2017 Assembly election that there was a possibility - albeit a slim one - unionists could lose their overall majority, a leading DUP MLA told me, \"Don\u0027t be silly, Alex, that\u0027s not going to happen. \n\n\"Why would you even write something like that?\"\n\nWell, they lost that majority. Unionists don\u0027t have a majority of either Council or Assembly seats across Belfast (24/60 BCC and 6/20 NIA). The overall vote for candidates who declared themselves as pro-Union/unionist at the last few elections has hovered uncomfortably close to or slightly lower than the 50% barrier.\n\nWhile recent opinion polls haven\u0027t given a consistent trend on support for Irish unity, they do suggest that what happens regarding the final Brexit deal could have a significant impact on two or three key demographics.\n\nGiven that sort of background, it would be a very sanguine or very stupid unionist who would argue that unionists shouldn\u0027t give serious consideration to a number of possibilities. The primary one, as Robinson says, is that a border poll is possible, particularly under a Labour government. It is the Secretary of State who makes the call - not unionists, not the DUP, not even Sammy Wilson. I would prefer that the leaders of unionism had given some thought to the possibility and made some sort of preparation for the campaign rather, than as Robinson says, burying their heads in the sand until \"only the soles of their feet are visible above the surface\".\n\nRobinson, Wilson and the rest of us from that generation will remember the body blow dealt to unionism by the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. They will remember the despair. They will remember how close we came to a tipping point. They will remember that something dismissed as an impossibility by the leadership of unionism at the time happened: happened over their heads and without any consultation.\n\nOnly a fool, a blinkered, irresponsible, thoroughly delusional fool would believe that a British government would not, again, spring another monumental shock upon unionism. And only a unionist of monumental stupidity would refuse to discuss, let alone prepare for that eventuality. \"Contingency planning is a judicious safety-net. Better by far to plan for adverse possibilities, no matter how remote, than be left clueless and unprepared if our hopes and evaluations are wrong\". Robinson is right. He wrote something similar in the joint UUP/DUP response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement published in June 1987 (The Task Force Report: An End To Drift):\n\n\"The temptation in such circumstances might be to do nothing. However we would consider this the ultimate abdication of responsibility.\"\n\nTo be honest, not much was done. Unionism paid the price of that ongoing abdication of responsibility by the leadership of both parties.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive.

Sinn Fein of course have led the charge, proudly proclaiming in the Irish News: \u0027Sinn Fein Vows to unseat Paisley\u0027.\n\n\"Many see this as their opportunity to oust Northern Ireland\u0027s most gifted voice in Parliament on Brexit. They also see it as an opportunity to rid themselves finally of Paisley\u0027s voice in defence of the union and on the Biblical moral issues such as same sex marriage and abortion.\"\n\nCllr Finlay said that this is why a few of Mr Paisley\u0027s friends had decided to call a meeting with him \"to show our support and hear from him first-hand how we tackle the future.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let us show the world that the friends of Ian Paisley still stand behind the man they believe in, good times and bad.\"\n\nMr Paisley could face a by-election if he is recalled under the terms of the Petition of Recall Act 2015. \n\nThe law gives constituents the power to recall their MPs, with an election triggered by at least 10% of the electorate in the constituency signing a petition.\n\nWith 75,478 constituents in Mr Paisley\u0027s North Antrim constituency, 7,547 signatures would be required to trigger a by-election.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland athletes in dublin games commended","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Both were later released on bail.\n\nLast month Inga-Maria\u0027s nephew Viktor Leibl (25) visited Northern Ireland for the first time, paying his respects at the memorial.\n\nHe said his family took comfort from the fact that so many people here have kept her memory alive.\n\nHe added that his mother Friederike, Inga-Maria\u0027s sister, also planned to make a visit in the future.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173767.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/E%20310718KB4%20%200003.jpg","title":"pride 2018 belfast out on the roof summer","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands take to streets for belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

and (Northern Ireland Secretary) Karen Bradley should be ashamed that 18 months after the collapse of devolution, same-sex couples in Northern Ireland are still waiting to be treated as equals.\n\n“This is now in their hands.”\n\nThe DUP has come under fire this week at various Pride events in Belfast over the use of a petition of concern to block legalisation of same-sex marriage when the Assembly was sitting.\n\n\nLifeline \n@belfastpride\n march \n#bproud2018\n \n#ComeOutForChange\n \npic.twitter/gPgRHTxvDN\n\n— Belfast Pride (@belfastpride) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster claimed on Thursday that a bid to fly a Pride flag at a council building was a republican ruse to remove the Union flag.\n\nArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council (ABC) councillors had voted to fly the flag at the weekend, to coincide with Pride Day, but DUP members triggered a procedural mechanism on Tuesday claiming that proper process had not been followed.\n\nThe “call-in” mechanism, which needs the backing of 15% of councillors, requires officials to seek legal advice on a course of action before proceeding.\n\nMrs Foster told BBC Radio Ulster: “As I understand it, the issue is not about Pride, the issue is about that the policy in the ABC council is only to fly the Union flag and the Armed Forces Day flag, and colleagues felt this was a ruse by republicans to remove our national flag, and it’s not about respect or Pride at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers from the Belfast Azlans, a gay rugby team, enjoy a game before joining Belfast Pride (Michael Cooper/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“We should have respect for each other but not if it’s going to be used as a ruse to take down the national flag.”\n\nThe move was labelled “bizarre” by Sinn Fein.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of around 50 Christian anti-Pride campaigners gathered at Belfast City Hall to protest against the event, reading Bible verses and singing hymns.\n\nThe Pride Festival is now one of the biggest events in Belfast and it has involved more than 100 events across 10 days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tenor bocelli to perform for pope at dublin event","story":"\n Hi

Francis is a privilege for our soul it is an honour for what the Supreme Pontiff represents in the world.\n\n“For the indescribable human fragility, typical of the average man such as myself, it brings me great pleasure and immense satisfaction to even have the privilege to be close to a person of such exceptional importance and grace.\n\n“It is a joy to be able to offer my most modest contribution on the occasion of this grand meeting and moment of reflection about the family.\n\n“The family remains the strongest building block of society, a cluster of affection, and a privileged space in which one can teach and learn – in every action – how to choose a life that leads toward the greater good.”\n\nFather Timothy Bartlett, secretary general of the World Meeting of Families 2018 event, said he was delighted.\n\n“He will bring so much to our gathering not just because of his wonderful talent but because of his love for his faith.\n\n“We are honoured that he has taken time out of an intensely busy schedule to come to Ireland to be part of our global celebration of family life.”\n\nBocelli has met Pope Francis and has performed for him on more than one occasion including at the last World Meeting of Families which took place in Philadelphia in 2015.\n\nHe is a devout Catholic and he has spoken openly many times about the importance of faith and how it takes first place in his life.\n\nHe has regularly donated his time and talent to causes and events that he is passionate about.\n\nBocelli will join other well-known acts already announced for the event including Nathan Carter, Daniel O’Donnell and Moya Brennan.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"highs of 31c expected as britain basks in glorious","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

and Dorset coast, such as Gosport, are most likely to feel the heat on Saturday, while the hottest areas on Sunday are expected to be around London stretching north to the Midlands.\n\n\nPlenty of sunshine means that \n#UV\n levels will be high across the bulk of England and Wales, and moderate for Scotland and Northern Ireland \npic.twitter/3yO3k7weM1\n\n— Met Office (@metoffice) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures could soar even higher early next week, with highs of 32C (89.6F) possible around London on Monday and Tuesday. \n\nBritons making the most of the balmy weekend were urged to stay “sun sensible” amid the high UV levels. \n\nHowever, not all of the UK will be gazing into clear blue skies – in Scotland and Northern Ireland clouds are likely with some thick enough to bring patchy rain to the north and west of Scotland. \n\nThe north-west, south-east split will continue early next week, with further showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland, while England and Wales stay generally dry and warmer. \n\n\nWe don’t know if you’ve heard… but it’s VERY… VERY hot!\n\nBe sun sensible this summer\n\n🌞🌞🌞 🌶️🌶️ 🌶️🌶️🌶️\n— EEAST Ambulance (@EastEnglandAmb) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England’s current August record – 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003.\n\nHowever, the intense heat is likely to lessen come Wednesday, as conditions turn “fresher and more changeable”, the Met Office said. \n\nIt comes amid an intense European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the sun most intensely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert.\n\nEarlier this week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, with temperatures peaking at 45.2C (113.4F) near Abrantes, a town in the centre of the country.\n\nEmergency services have issued a red alert until Sunday, with medical staff and firefighters on standby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA boy jumps from a platform over the water at La Concha beach in northern Spain (Alvaro Barrientos/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 400 firefighters and five water-dropping aircraft are battling a wildfire in southern Portugal’s Algarve region.\n\nIn Spain, heat warnings have been issued for 41 of the country’s 50 provinces as temperatures are expected to reach up to 44C (111.2F).\n\nIn northern Europe, Sweden is still under threat from wildfires, which in recent weeks have extended into the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe Met Office said it was unlikely that the overall European highest temperature recorded – 48C (118.4F) in Athens, Greece in 1977 – would be beaten.\n\nBritish holiday-makers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures double celebration as meghan enjoys 37th

Lynch explained:\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])

entries to date as well as 40 plus relay teams of three which is a big increase on last year and indicates that the individual limit will be reached soon,” he revealed.\n\n“The NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships and qualification for the Commonwealth Championships is a big carrot for the top male and female entrants to aim for and this should add to the quality of the field and the up front competition on the day.\n\n“The event sells out every year and with the continued growth of athletics and running clubs locally our advice to anyone intending to take part is to register online now to avoid disappointment when entries close on August 13\nth\n.”\nThe Waterside Half Marathon is one of the longest running athletics events in Ireland with a scenic route that takes in both sides of the River Foyle, passing many of the city’s historic landmarks including its famous walls and the Guildhall.\nThe 13.1 mile course has runner, wheelchair and three person relay categories, the event is open to athletes of all levels and abilities and all entrants to the main race must be aged 17 or over on race day.\nA number of groups have already registered for the event to raise funds for their chosen charities including a group of over 20 runners from Firstsource Solutions in Derry who are taking part in aid of Foyle Search and Rescue.\nThe event includes a team of 12 pacers who will be identifiable at the race start by helium balloons displaying their times.\nPacer times start at 1 hour and 30 minutes and rise in increments of 15 minutes up to 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n“The pacers are all experienced runners who have studied the terrain of the course beforehand and they have always been spot on with their timings,” Gerry explained.\n“The beauty of having different pacers is that if peoples’ goals change during the race they have the option to slow down or speed up to join the pacers behind or in front.\n“Pacers will be walking around the start line for half an hour before the race and will be identifiable by helium balloons and t shirts showing their time so runners can file in behind them at the race start.”\n“It’s a spectator friendly route with the start and finish at St Columb’s Park and people can stand anywhere along the river bank on the west bank and enjoy the action.\n“Between the Peace Bridge and Coshowen runners will be running in both directions so that is a particularly good place to enjoy the action.”\nAll participants will receive a specially commissioned Waterside Half Marathon medal and race t shirt.\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13\nth\n August 2018 and you can register online now
